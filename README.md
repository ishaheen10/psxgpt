# psxGPT üìä

A ChatGPT-like application for Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) financial data.

## üîç Overview

psxGPT is a multi-step data processing pipeline and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. It automatically downloads financial reports from the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) website, converts them to markdown, chunks them, extracts metadata, and creates vector embeddings using Google Gemini. Finally, it provides a Gradio web interface allowing users to ask natural language questions about the financial data and receive spreadsheet-ready answers.

Additionally, psxGPT now includes both an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables integration with Claude Desktop and a dedicated Chainlit-based MCP client that provides a web interface specifically optimized for Claude 3.5 Sonnet, offering a seamless financial analysis experience with enhanced tool usage capabilities.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10.16 or higher
- uv package manager
- Google Gemini API key
- LlamaParse API key (for Step 2 PDF processing - [get a free key here](https://docs.cloud.llamaindex.ai/llamacloud/getting_started/api_key))
- Anthropic API key (for Claude 3.5 Sonnet integration)
- Literal API key (for Chainlit web interface - [get a free key here](https://cloud.getliteral.ai/))
- Claude Desktop (optional, for MCP integration)

### API Keys and Alternatives

#### LlamaParse for PDF Processing
For Step 2 (`Step2ConvertPDFtoMarkdown.py`), you'll need a LlamaParse API key from LlamaCloud. The free tier allows processing up to 3,000 pages, which should be sufficient for initial testing. You can obtain a free API key by following the instructions [here](https://docs.cloud.llamaindex.ai/llamacloud/getting_started/api_key).

If you need to process more pages or prefer not to use LlamaParse, you can modify the code to use alternative open-source PDF parsers such as:
- [PyMuPDF4LLM](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF-Utilities/tree/master/pymupdf4llm)
- [Marker](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker)
- [Unstructured](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured)

#### Google Gemini API
The embeddings and LLM functionality require a Google Gemini API key, which you can obtain from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ishaheen10/psxgpt.git
   cd psxgpt
   ```

2. Set up your environment:

   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Navigate to the API keys section
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key and add it to your `.env` file

4. Generate the vector index:
   ```bash
   # Use 'python' on Windows, 'python3' on Mac/Linux
   python Step6CreateEmbeddings.py
   ```

5. Run the application (choose one):
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Gradio web interface
   python Step7LaunchGradioWithFilters.py
   
   # Option 2: MCP server for Claude Desktop integration
   python Step8MCPServerPsxGPT.py
   
   # Option 3: Chainlit web interface with Claude 3.5 Sonnet

## üåé Using Claude Desktop with psxGPT MCP Server

The MCP server provides a seamless integration with Claude Desktop, allowing you to query PSX financial data directly within the Claude interface. What makes this integration powerful is that Claude intelligently uses the MCP tools to gather relevant context for your questions, breaking down complex queries into logical steps for data retrieval and analysis.

### Setting up Claude Desktop with psxGPT

1. Install Claude Desktop from [anthropic.com/claude/download](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/download)

2. Run the MCP server:
   ```bash
   python Step8MCPServerPsxGPT.py
   ```

3. Configure Claude Desktop:
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Click on Settings (gear icon)
   - Navigate to "Developer" section
   - Click "Edit config" and add the following to your config file:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "PSX Financial Statements Server": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": [
           "/path/to/your/psxChatGPT/Step8MCPServerPsxGPT.py"
         ],
         "env": {
           "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your_gemini_api_key_here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Replace `/path/to/your/psxChatGPT` with the actual path to your project
   - Replace `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual Gemini API key
   - Save the config file and restart Claude Desktop

4. Once connected, you can ask Claude questions about PSX financial data, and it will use the MCP server to retrieve and analyze information.

### Example interactions with Claude Desktop

#### Basic Queries:
- "Find the unconsolidated profit and loss statement for Meezan Bank in 2023"
- "What were the total assets of HBL in their 2022 consolidated balance sheet?"
- "Compare the profit margins of MCB and UBL for 2023"

#### Advanced Analysis Queries:
- "Write an investment memo to Warren Buffet on Pakistan's banking sector with a focus on Meezan Bank and MCB"
- "Analyze the financial health of Pakistan's top 3 banks based on their Q1 2024 statements"
- "What are the key risk factors in HBL's financial statements over the past two years?"
- "Compare Islamic banks vs conventional banks in Pakistan based on their profitability and asset quality"
- "Draft a one-page summary of UBL's performance in 2023 compared to its industry peers"

### How It Works

The MCP architecture allows Claude to:

1. **Understand your query**: Claude parses your request to identify which companies, time periods, and financial statements are needed
2. **Gather relevant context**: Claude automatically calls the appropriate MCP tools to find and retrieve the most relevant financial data
3. **Analyze the information**: Using its reasoning capabilities, Claude synthesizes the data into coherent, insightful responses
4. **Present findings**: Claude formats the response according to your needs (text analysis, tables, or comparisons)

This integrated approach means you can ask increasingly sophisticated questions without needing to understand the underlying data structure or retrieval process.

### Important notes about Claude Desktop integration

- **Subscription Requirement**: Due to the context-heavy nature of financial statements, you will likely need a Claude paid subscription (Claude Pro or higher) to gather sufficient context for complex queries.
- **Alternative MCP Clients**: Any MCP-compatible client can connect to the psxGPT server, but Claude Desktop provides the easiest setup experience.
- **Server Restart**: You may need to restart the MCP server occasionally if you encounter connection issues or after system sleep/hibernation.
- **Complex Analysis**: For detailed financial analysis, the more specific your question, the better the results. Claude will progressively gather context for multi-step analyses.

## üíª Using the Chainlit Web Interface with Claude 3.5 Sonnet

The Chainlit-based MCP client provides a modern web interface that connects directly to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and the PSX MCP server, offering a seamless financial analysis experience in your browser.

### Setting up the Chainlit Client

1. Ensure you have the required API keys:
   - Anthropic API key: Sign up at [anthropic.com](https://www.anthropic.com/) and get an API key
   - Literal API key: Sign up at [cloud.getliteral.ai](https://cloud.getliteral.ai/) and get an API key
   - Add both to your `.env` file:
     ```
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
     LITERAL_API_KEY=your_literal_key_here
     ```

2. Start the MCP server in one terminal:
   ```bash
   python Step8MCPServerPsxGPT.py
   ```

3. Start the Chainlit client in another terminal:
   ```bash
   python Step9MCPClientPsxGPT.py
   ```

4. Open your browser at http://localhost:8000

5. Log in with the default credentials:
   - Username: asfi@psx.com
   - Password: asfi123

### Key Features of the Chainlit Interface

- **Web-Based Access**: No need to install Claude Desktop - access the full capabilities through your browser
- **Optimized Prompting**: The client includes carefully crafted system prompts that ensure Claude properly formats queries to the MCP server
- **Persistent Chat History**: Your conversations are saved and can be resumed later
- **Enhanced Tool Usage**: The implementation ensures proper handling of the filing_period parameter to get accurate financial data
- **Structured Financial Data**: Results are presented in a clean, readable format with proper formatting of tables and financial figures

### Example Queries for the Chainlit Interface

The Chainlit interface supports the same types of queries as the Claude Desktop integration, with the added benefit of being accessible through a web browser:

- "Show me HBL's 2023 consolidated balance sheet"
- "What was the profit after tax for MCB in 2024?"
- "Compare the ROE of UBL and ABL for 2023"
- "Analyze the liquidity ratios of Meezan Bank from 2022 to 2024"
