# psxGPT üìä

A ChatGPT-like application for Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) financial data.

## üîç Overview

psxGPT is a multi-step data processing pipeline and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. It automatically downloads financial reports from the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) website, converts them to markdown, chunks them, extracts metadata, and creates vector embeddings using Google Gemini. Finally, it provides a Gradio web interface allowing users to ask natural language questions about the financial data and receive spreadsheet-ready answers.

## ‚ú® Features

- üì• Automatic download of financial reports from PSX website
- üìÑ PDF processing and chunking with intelligent financial statement detection
- üß† Vector embeddings for efficient retrieval
- üí¨ Natural language interface for querying financial data
- üìù Spreadsheet-ready output format

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10.16 or higher
- uv package manager
- Google Gemini API key

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ishaheen10/psxgpt.git
   cd psxgpt
   ```

2. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file with your Google Gemini API key
   echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   
   # Create and activate a virtual environment
   uv venv
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   # For Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # For Mac/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   uv sync
   ```

3. Get your Google Gemini API key:
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Navigate to the API keys section
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key and add it to your `.env` file

4. Generate the vector index:
   ```bash
   # Use 'python' on Windows, 'python3' on Mac/Linux
   python Step6CreateEmbeddings.py
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python Step7LaunchGradio.py
   ```

6. Open your browser at http://localhost:7860

## üí° Example Queries

- "Show me the profit and loss statement for HBL in Q1 2024"
- "What was UBL's total assets in March 2024?"
- "Compare the net profit of MCB and MEBL for Q1 2024"

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

- `Step1DownloadPDFs.py`: Downloads financial reports from PSX website
- `Step2ConvertPDFtoMarkdown.py`: Converts downloaded PDFs into markdown format
- `Step3ChunkMarkdown.py`: Chunks the markdown files into smaller pieces
- `Step4MetaDataTags.py`: Extracts metadata tags from the chunks
- `Step5CombineMetaData.py`: Combines metadata from different sources
- `Step6CreateEmbeddings.py`: Creates vector embeddings for the chunks using Google Gemini
- `Step7LaunchGradioWithFilters.py`: Runs the main Gradio web interface for querying
- `Step7aGradioAppNoFilters.py`: (Alternative) Runs a simplified Gradio interface without meta data filters
- `tickers.json`: Maps company tickers to full names
- `pyproject.toml`: Project metadata and dependencies for `uv`
- `.env`: File to store your Google Gemini API key (you need to create this)
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore

**Note:** The `gemini_index_metadata/` directory containing the vector index is generated locally by `Step6CreateEmbeddings.py` and is not included in the GitHub repository due to its size.
