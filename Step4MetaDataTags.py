Analyze the following text which contains multiple numbered markdown chunks from the file '{filename}'.
Financial reports typically have a structure: preliminary sections (Director's Report, Auditor's Report, Management Discussion), followed by main financial statements (often presented first as Unconsolidated, then Consolidated, or vice-versa), and finally Notes to the Financial Statements. Context often carries over between adjacent chunks within these sections.

Your primary task is to identify WHICH of these chunks contain financial information relevant to the report's structure.
For ONLY those chunks identified as containing relevant financial information, generate metadata according to the specified format. Ensure you correctly associate the metadata with the original chunk number found in the '## Chunk X' header.

IMPORTANT: After the first chunk containing consolidated or unconsolidated financial statement is identified, then include all subsequent chunks even if they do not contain numerical data.

Batch Content:
--- START BATCH ---
{batch_content}
--- END BATCH ---

Metadata Requirements for EACH relevant financial chunk identified within the batch:
1.  `chunk_number`: Extract the integer number X from the '## Chunk X' header preceding the chunk. THIS IS MANDATORY.
2.  `financial_data`:
    * Set to "yes" for ANY chunk that is part of the main financial statements (Consolidated or Unconsolidated Balance Sheet, P&L, Cash Flow, Equity Changes, Comprehensive Income) OR the Notes to these statements even if they appear not to contain numerical information.
    * For chunks appearing *before* the main financial statements (like Director's Report, Auditor's Report, MD&A, economic overviews): set to "yes" ONLY if the chunk contains substantive financial figures, quantitative analysis, or detailed financial discussion. Otherwise, set to "no" for these preliminary chunks if they lack direct financial data, even if they are part of the report structure (e.g., a purely qualitative section of a Director's report). Chunks with only general corporate information (like lists of directors) should generally not have metadata generated unless they explicitly discuss financials.
    * Only output metadata objects for chunks where `financial_data` is "yes".
3.  `financial_statement_scope`: Identify if the chunk belongs to "consolidated" or "unconsolidated" financial statements.
    * Look for explicit headers like "Consolidated Statement of Financial Position" or "Condensed Interim Unconsolidated Financial Statements".
    * Once a scope ("consolidated" or "unconsolidated") is identified for a statement or the start of the notes section pertaining to that scope, apply the SAME scope to subsequent chunks *within this batch* that clearly belong to that same section (i.e., other statements or notes under that same consolidated/unconsolidated heading).
    * If the chunk is part of a report (Director's, Auditor's) or discussion *before* the main statements, or if the scope cannot be determined from the context within the batch, use "none".
4.  `is_statement`: "yes" or "no". Does the chunk primarily contain one of the main financial statements listed below?
5.  `statement_type`: If `is_statement` is "yes", classify as one of the following based on titles and content:
    * "profit_and_loss": Look for titles like "Profit & Loss Account", "Income Statement", "Statement of Operations". Contains revenues, expenses, profit/loss figures.
    * "balance_sheet": Look for titles like "Statement of Financial Position", "Balance Sheet". Contains assets, liabilities, equity figures.
    * "cash_flow": Look for titles like "Cash Flow Statement", "Statement of Cash Flows". Contains operating, investing, financing cash flow activities.
    * "changes_in_equity": Look for titles like "Statement of Changes in Equity". Shows movements in equity components (share capital, reserves, retained earnings).
    * "comprehensive_income": Look for titles like "Statement of Comprehensive Income". Includes net income plus other comprehensive income (OCI) items.
    * If `is_statement` is "no", use "none".
6.  `is_note`: "yes" or "no". Does the chunk primarily represent a note *to* the financial statements? Look for headings like "Notes to the Financial Statements", "Notes to and forming part of...", or numbered note structures (e.g., "Note 1", "Note 2.1", "Note 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES").
7.  `note_link`: If `is_note` is "yes", try to determine if the note primarily relates to one of the main statement types ("profit_and_loss", "balance_sheet", "cash_flow", "changes_in_equity", "comprehensive_income") based on context or explicit references within the note. If it's a general note (like accounting policies) or the link isn't clear, use "none".
8.  `auditor_report`: "yes" or "no". Does the chunk contain the Independent Auditor's Report? Look for titles like "Independent Auditor's Report", "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm". Content typically addresses shareholders, mentions auditing standards (ISA, PCAOB, etc.), includes basis for opinion, and expresses an opinion ("In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly..."). Usually signed by an external audit firm (e.g., KPMG, PwC, Deloitte, EY) and appears *before* the main financial statements.
9.  `director_report`: "yes" or "no". Does the chunk contain the Directors' Report or Chairman's Statement? Look for titles like "Directorsâ€™ Report", "Report of the Directors", "Chairman's Review/Statement". Content often discusses overall performance, strategy, economic outlook, acknowledges stakeholders, may present financial highlights *summarized* from the main statements. Usually signed by the Chairman or CEO/President on behalf of the board and appears *before* the main financial statements and often before the Auditor's Report.
10. `annual_report_discussion`: "yes" or "no". Does the chunk contain Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A), financial review, economic snapshot, or similar narrative financial analysis, typically appearing *before* the main statements but distinct from the formal Auditor's or Directors' reports?
11. `file_name`: Set this to "{filename}".

Output Format:
Provide the output ONLY as a single JSON array. Each object in the array represents ONE chunk from the input batch that was identified as having `financial_data: "yes"`.
If NO such chunks are found in the entire batch, output an empty JSON array: []
Do NOT include introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting around the JSON.
