# DIRECTORS’ REVIEW

Dear Shareholders

The Directors present unaudited condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

# Economy:

Pakistan’s economy is undergoing a broad-based stabilization – receding inflation, contained twin deficit, easing external pressures and improved confidence. Inflation has been on a downturn since the beginning of the year as CPI reduced from 29.7 percent in Dec ’23 to 6.9 percent in Sep ’24. The sharp pace of disinflation and improving indicators prompted further monetary easing as the policy rate was reduced by 300bps during the current quarter, to 17.5 percent in Sep’24, a cumulative reduction of 450bps during the current year. On the external account, elevated remittance inflows and improved export earnings compensated the increase in imports and helped contain current account deficit that was also benefited by favorable changes in oil prices and relative easing of global financial conditions. Looking ahead, economy is poised to build on its recent progress as the GDP growth is projected at around 3 percent for the current fiscal year. LSM is regaining as major export sectors are showing readiness to scale up production, however outlook for agriculture will be impacted by the expected shortfall in cotton production against the target. Also, inflation outlook in the near-term appears susceptible to risks owing to uncertainty of energy price adjustments, and additional fiscal measures. The recent economic indicators need to gain traction for sustained recovery driven by continued fiscal restraint, structural reforms particularly energy sector, enhanced private sector participation and external financing needs along with support from bilateral and multilateral partners.

# Askari Bank Financial Results

Askari Bank posted profit before tax of Rs.27.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 2 percent decline mainly due to reduction in markup income upon restructuring of loan to a large PSE during the current period. Earnings per share at Rs. 9.68 for the current period compares with Rs.10.05 for same period last year.

Total revenues increased by 7 percent to Rs. 54.1 billion mainly contributed by net mark-up income that also increased by 7 percent yoy. The increase in net mark-up income was driven by volumetric growth, a 29 percent increase in earning assets partially offset by higher cost of funds. Non markup income increased by 11 percent to Rs. 10.9 billion. The Bank's strategy of opening new branches and investing in technology, along with the impact of inflation, resulted in higher operating expense that increase by 18 percent. Cost to income ratio stood at 46.6 percent for the period in review.

Customer deposits closed at Rs.1.4 trillion at September 30, 2024, a 9 percent growth during the current period. CASA deposit recorded a growth of 14 percent and constitute 88 percent of the total deposits at period end, an improvement from 84 percent. Advances declined by 24 percent mainly due to net retirement of short-term seasonal financing during the quarter. The Bank recognized credit loss allowance of Rs. 1.2 billion compared to a net provision charge of Rs. 690 million for the comparable period.

During the period, IFRS-9 has been adopted as per regulatory guidance and requisite financial disclosures have been made in the annexed financial statements. The Bank is well capitalized with adequate buffers over regulatory requirements. At September 30, 2024, leverage ratio was recorded at 3.46 percent and capital adequacy ratio 21.19 percent.

The Bank’s entity rating was reaffirmed at ‘AA+’ (Double A Plus) for the long-term by Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA), with outlook assigned as ‘Stable’. The Bank’s strong brand and affiliation with Fauji Foundation are recognized as the key rating drivers, supported by Bank's experienced management team, prudent risk management policies, and deep-rooted relationship with clients. Lately, retention of profits in the Bank to bolster the capital structure is also a testimonial of support. The short-term rating was maintained at ‘A1+’ (A One Plus).

Askari Bank continues to expand its market positioning for sustainable growth and commitment to improve value proposition. The Bank is focused on expanding its market share in retail segment, particularly low-cost deposits and consumer products through optimization and strategic branch expansion. Emphasis will remain on boosting trade volumes with a focus on SME and commercial segments. Customer experience remains a key priority aided by continued initiatives in the areas of process improvements, digitization, automation and data analytics. Effective Risk management will remain the key across all lines of businesses as environment remains challenging. The Bank will continue to pursue strong governance and compliance discipline and will continue to invest in talent and technology enabling its teams to do more to help our customers achieve their ambitions and in-turn drive Askari Bank to grow in the future.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

# 2.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION

# 2.1.1

These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements represent separate financial statements of Askari Bank Limited. The consolidated condensed interim financial statements of the Group are being issued separately.

# 2.1.2

The unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are presented in Pak Rupees, which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency. The amounts are rounded off to the nearest thousand.

# 2.1.3

These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except that certain classes of fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are stated at revalued amounts and certain investments have been marked to market and are carried at fair value. In addition, obligations in respect of staff retirement benefits and lease liabilities are carried at present value.

# 2.2 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

# 2.2.1

These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the approved accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The approved accounting and reporting standards comprise of:

- International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, Interim Financial Reporting, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017;
---
# Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP)

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IFRS or IFAS the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives, shall prevail.

# 2.2.2

The State Bank of Pakistan has deferred the applicability of IFAS 3 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits', vide BPRD Circular No.04 dated February 25, 2015 and International Accounting Standard 40, Investment Property, vide BSD Circular Letter no. 10 dated August 26, 2002, for banking companies till further instructions. Further, the SECP, through S.R.O 411(1)/2008 dated April 28, 2008, has deferred the applicability of IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, to banks. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 2.2.3

These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been presented in accordance with the requirements of format prescribed by SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 2 dated February 09, 2023 and International Accounting Standard 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' and do not include all the information and disclosures required in the audited annual unconsolidated financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the audited annual unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the financial year ended December 31, 2023.

# 3. Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published approved accounting standards that are effective in the current period

During the year, the Bank has adopted IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan with effect from 01 January 2024 (refer note 4.1 for details). There are certain other amendments to accounting and reporting standards that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. Except for IFRS 9, these are either considered not to be relevant or do not have any significant effect on the Bank's operations and are therefore not detailed in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 3.1 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published approved accounting standards that are not yet effective

There are various amendments to accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan that are not yet effective in the current period. These are not likely to have material effect on the Bank's financial statements.

# 4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policies applied in preparation of these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements are consistent with those as applied in the preparation of annual unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for the following:

# 4.1 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

During the period, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9: ‘Financial Instruments' (the Standard) became applicable to the Bank. BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 issued by SBP provides detailed instructions on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks. The SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 have made amendments and extend the timelines of IFRS 9 application instructions.
---
The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘expected credit losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions from January 1, 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at 1 January 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard. Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9. The accounting policies applicable to the 2023 presented information is consistent with the policies mentioned in 31 December 2023 annual financial statements.

SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 have made certain amendments and extended timelines of application instructions for certain areas where the banking industry has sought more time. These amendments and relaxations include use modification accounting for financial assets and liabilities as per IFRS 9 standard and recording and treatment of staff loan and advances at reduced rates to given effect from 1 October 2024. Further, the banks have been asked to use existing practices of recordings of interest/markup income using effective interest rate and ensure full recognition from 1 October 2024, this in turn also effects the reduced rate loans and modified assets accounting. Moreover, SBP have allowed an extension to Banks up to December 31, 2024 for developing the requisite models for calculating EAD for revolving products beyond the contractual date. In addition the banks have also been allowed to continue the existing practice of valuing unquoted equity investment at their cost or breakup value, whichever is lower, till 31 December 2024 and perform fair valuation of these securities afterwards.

# 4.1.1 Impact on the condensed interim unconsolidated statement of financial position:

# 4.1.4 Impact on regulatory capital

In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the 'Application Instructions' issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement.

The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the “transitional adjustment amount”) must be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the “transition period” of five years.

Moreover, SBP has allowed to adjust the amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions in Tier 2 Capital that have not been added back to CET 1 and vice versa as per Annexure-A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024.

The impact of adoption of IFRS 9 on the capital ratios of the Bank are as follows:

| |As per previous Reporting (31 December 2023)|At 1 January 2024 after adoption of IFRS 9|
|---|---|---|
|Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Adequacy ratio|15.11%|14.15%|
|Tier 1 Capital Adequacy Ratio|16.08%|15.12%|
|Total Capital Adequacy Ratio|18.35%|17.52%|

# 4.1.5 Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) regardless of the business model in which they are held.

# Recognition / derecognition and initial measurement

Trade receivable and debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at transaction price.

The policy for derecognition of financial asset and liabilities are consistent with the annual unconsolidated financials statements of the bank for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# Classification

# Financial Assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL.
---
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Bank changes its business models for managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following changes in the business model.

IFRS 9 allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any 'accounting mismatch' that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different basis. SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout life of the instrument. Nonetheless, banks should avoid this option for financial instruments that are categorized as Level 3 in terms of the IFRS 13 hierarchy.

# Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognized in profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method. Markup expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit and loss.

# 4.1.6 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either Held to collect, Held to collect and sale and Others based on Business model assessment. The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The assessment requires judgement based on facts and circumstances on the date of assessment.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.
---
The assessment considers the policies and objectives for the portfolio of financial assets, risk affecting, performance evaluation, historical sales information etc.

# 4.1.7 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)

The Bank assesses whether the contractual cash flows of a financial asset meet the Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criterion by examining the contractual terms. This includes checking for terms that could alter the amount and timings of cash flows, such as contingent events, leverage, or prepayment features, etc.

A prepayment feature aligns with SPPI if it mainly represents unpaid principal and profit, including reasonable compensation for early termination.

For fixed-rate financings with periodic profit rate resets, the Bank considers these SPPI-compliant as the revised rates reflect time value, credit risk, and other associated risks.

# 4.1.8 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

|Financial assets at FVTPL|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any markup or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.|
|---|---|
|Financial assets at amortised cost|These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Markup, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.|
|Debt investments at FVOCI|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and is assessed for impairment under the new ECL model. Markup income is calculated using the effective interest method and includes amortization of premiums and accretion of discount, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in income statement. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to income statement.|
|Equity investments at FVOCI|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are adjusted from the carrying value of investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to income statement.|

The banks are allowed to continue measuring unquoted equity securities at the lower of cost or break-up value up to December 31, 2024. However, Bank shall be required to measure unquoted equity securities at fair value, as required in the IFRS 9 application instructions, with effect from January 1, 2025.

# 4.1.9 Modification

Financial assets

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of loans to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognized and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs.
---
If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the bank first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognizes the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred, and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

# Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability recognized and consideration paid is recognized in profit or loss. Consideration paid includes non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability.

If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. For floating-rate financial liabilities, the original effective interest rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs and fees incurred are recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument.

# 4.1.10 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’).

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognized are in 'Stage 1'; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in 'Stage 2'; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in 'Stage 3'. Under the SBP's instructions, the Bank is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency.

Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 and SBP's IFRS 9 application instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12-month ECL, Stage1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2).
---
- EAD: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortization, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.

- LGD: An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

# 4.1.11 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations. A financial asset is transitioned to a backward stage in line with SBP instructions.

# 4.1.12 Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank has adopted a governance framework requiring multiple functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. The Risk Department defines the staging criteria for the new impairment model and take ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach. Additionally, the Risk department also take the ownership of the impact of ECL on bank's capital.

The Bank's Finance Division performs ECL calculation. As a result, the department then assess the financial impact, meet the financial reporting requirements and further monitor the impact on the financial ratios.

As per the Bank's policy, the Bank's Internal Audit function carries out periodic review of IFRS 9 methodology and impacts calculated by the Management.

# 4.2 Revised format of condensed interim financial statements

The SBP through its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 9, 2023, and BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, has amended the format of quarterly and half yearly financial statements of banks. All banks are directed to prepare their quarterly and half yearly financial statements on the revised format effective from accounting year starting from January 1, 2024.

Accordingly, the Bank has prepared these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements on the new format prescribed by the SBP.

The adoption of revised format has resulted in following significant changes:

- Right-of-use-assets (note 12) amounting to Rs 9,853,577 thousand (December 31, 2023: Rs 8,312,812 thousand) which were previously shown as part of fixed assets are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.

# 34.1 Tax status and contingencies

i) During the year ended December 31 2023, the Federal Government issued S.R.O 1588 (l)/2023 on 21 November 2023 under section 99D of the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, whereby the banking sector was specified the sector for the payment of additional tax on windfall income. Through said S.R.O, the Federal Government also specified the method to determine windfall income, tax rate to be applied on such windfall income and tax years under scope. The Bank has challenged the S.R.O through petition before the Honorable Islamabad High Court with regards to retrospective application of Section 99D of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for tax years 2022 and 2023. The Honorable Islamabad High Court through its order dated 30 November 2023 has suspended the operation of S.R.O.1588 (l)/2023 and the said injunctive order continues to operate till date of next hearing for which no date has been fixed yet. Management based on the legal advisor opinion believes that the bank has reasonably good chance to succeed in this case and therefore has not recognized any provision in the financial statements. Additional tax on windfall income for tax years 2022 and 2023 is estimated to be Rs. 2,189 million.

ii) The Bank has filed tax returns for and up to tax year 2024. The assessments for and up to tax year 2023 were amended by the tax authorities creating accumulated additional tax demand, mainly in the matters of admissibility of recoveries against doubtful debts for Rs 1,119 million, provision for diminution in the value of investments for Rs 3,144.44 million, bad debts written off for Rs 242.892 million, provision for substandard advances for Rs 74.95 million, Provision against other assets/fixed assets for Rs 145.81 million, disallowance of employee benefit expenses Rs 228.680 Million, disallowance of depreciation on lease assets Rs 773.88 and Other disallowances of expenses/credits for Rs 551.78 million. Bank’s Appeals against these orders are currently pending before Commissioner Appeals, Appellate Tribunal and Islamabad High Court. The management and tax advisor of the Bank are confident that these matters will be decided in favor of the Bank and consequently no provision has been made thereon. Tax payments by the Bank against certain matters are being carried forward as receivable, as management and tax advisor of the Bank are confident of their realization.

iii) Consequent upon the amalgamation with and into the Bank, the outstanding tax issues relating to Askari Leasing Limited (ALL) are as follows: Tax returns of ALL have been filed for and up to tax year 2010. The returns for the tax years 2003 to 2010 were amended by the tax authorities mainly in the matter of admissibility of initial allowance claimed on leased vehicles. On appeals filed by ALL, partial relief was provided by the CIR(A) by allowing initial allowance on commercial vehicles. Re-assessment has not yet been carried out by the tax department. A tax demand is however not likely to arise after re-assessment. For and up to the assessment years 2002-2003, reference applications filed by the tax authorities in the matter of computation of lease income are pending decisions by the High Court. However, the likelihood of an adverse decision is considered low due to a favorable decision of the High Court in a parallel case.

# 36. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as Amortised Cost, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as Amortised Cost are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term advances, fixed term deposits and borrowings, other assets and other liabilities cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings, are frequently repriced.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in these unconsolidated financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

# 36.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets (Pakistan Stock Exchange) for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) available at MUFAP and Reuters page.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2 and level 3:

|Federal Government Securities|The fair values of Federal Government Securities are determined on the basis of rates / prices sourced from Reuters.|
|---|---|
|Non Government Debt Securities|Non Government Debt Securities are valued on the basis of rates announced by Mutual Fund Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).|
|Foreign Government Debt Securities|Foreign Government Debt Securities are valued on the basis of rates taken from custodian of the securities which are usually drawn from Bloomberg.|
|Unit of Mutual Funds|Fair values of mutual funds are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of reporting period.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions|The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.|
|Fixed Assets and Non Banking Assets Acquired in Satisfaction of Claims|Land and Non Banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are valued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessments of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.|

- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017;
---
# Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IFRS or IFAS the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives, shall prevail.

# 2.2.2

The State Bank of Pakistan has deferred the applicability of IFAS 3 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits', vide BPRD Circular No.04 dated February 25, 2015 and International Accounting Standard 40, Investment Property, vide BSD Circular Letter no. 10 dated August 26, 2002, for banking companies till further instructions. Further, the SECP, through S.R.O 411(1)/2008 dated April 28, 2008, has deferred the applicability of IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, to banks. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 2.2.3

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been presented in accordance with the requirements of format prescribed by SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 2 dated February 09, 2023 and International Accounting Standard 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' and do not include all the information and disclosures required in the audited annual consolidated financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial statements of the Group for the financial year ended December 31, 2023.

# 3. Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published approved accounting standards that are effective in the current period

During the year, the Group has adopted IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan with effect from 01 January 2024 (refer note 4.1 for details). There are certain other amendments to accounting and reporting standards that are mandatory for the Group's accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. Except for IFRS 9, these are either considered not to be relevant or do not have any significant effect on the Group's operations and are therefore not detailed in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 3.1

Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published approved accounting standards that are not yet effective

There are various amendments to accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan that are not yet effective in the current period. These are not likely to have material effect on the Group's financial statements.

# 4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policies applied in preparation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements are consistent with those as applied in the preparation of annual consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for the following:

# 4.1 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

During the period, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9: ‘Financial Instruments' (the Standard) became applicable to the Group. BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 issued by SBP provides detailed instructions on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks. The SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 have made amendments and extend the timelines of IFRS 9 application instructions.
---
The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘expected credit losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Group which are exposed to credit risk.

The Group has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions from January 1, 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at 1 January 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard. Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9. The accounting policies applicable to the 2023 presented information is consistent with the policies mentioned in 31 December 2023 annual financial statements.

SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 have made certain amendments and extended timelines of application instructions for certain areas where the banking industry has sought more time. These amendments and relaxations include use modification accounting for financial assets and liabilities as per IFRS 9 standard and recording and treatment of staff loan and advances at reduced rates to given effect from 1 October 2024. Further, the banks have been asked to use existing practices of recordings of interest/markup income using effective interest rate and ensure full recognition from 1 October 2024, this in turn also effects the reduced rate loans and modified assets accounting. Moreover, SBP have allowed an extension to Banks up to December 31, 2024 for developing the requisite models for calculating EAD for revolving products beyond the contractual date. In addition the banks have also been allowed to continue the existing practice of valuing unquoted equity investment at their cost or breakup value, whichever is lower, till 31 December 2024 and perform fair valuation of these securities afterwards.

# 4.1.1 Impact on the condensed interim unconsolidated statement of financial position:

The effect of this change in accounting policy on the financial assets and financial liabilities is as follows:

# 4.1.4 Impact on regulatory capital

In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the 'Application Instructions' issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement.

The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the “transitional adjustment amount”) must be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the “transition period” of five years.

Moreover, SBP has allowed to adjust the amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions in Tier 2 Capital that have not been added back to CET 1 and vice versa as per Annexure-A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024.

The impact of adoption of IFRS 9 on the capital ratios of the Group are as follows:

| |As per previous Reporting (31 December 2023)|At 1 January 2024 after adoption of IFRS 9|
|---|---|---|
|Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Adequacy ratio|15.11%|14.15%|
|Tier 1 Capital Adequacy Ratio|16.08%|15.12%|
|Total Capital Adequacy Ratio|18.35%|17.52%|

# 4.1.5 Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) regardless of the business model in which they are held.

# Recognition / derecognition and initial measurement

Trade receivable and debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at transaction price.

The policy for derecognition of financial asset and liabilities are consistent with the annual consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# Classification

# Financial Assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL.
---
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business models for managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following changes in the business model.

IFRS 9 allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any 'accounting mismatch' that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different basis. SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout life of the instrument. Nonetheless, banks should avoid this option for financial instruments that are categorized as Level 3 in terms of the IFRS 13 hierarchy.

# 4.1.6 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either Held to collect, Held to collect and sale and Others based on Business model assessment. The Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The assessment requires judgement based on facts and circumstances on the date of assessment.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.
---
The assessment considers the policies and objectives for the portfolio of financial assets, risk affecting, performance evaluation, historical sales information etc.

# 4.1.7 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)

The Group assesses whether the contractual cash flows of a financial asset meet the Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criterion by examining the contractual terms. This includes checking for terms that could alter the amount and timings of cash flows, such as contingent events, leverage, or prepayment features, etc.

A prepayment feature aligns with SPPI if it mainly represents unpaid principal and profit, including reasonable compensation for early termination.

For fixed-rate financings with periodic profit rate resets, the Group considers these SPPI-compliant as the revised rates reflect time value, credit risk, and other associated risks.

# 4.1.8 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

|Financial assets at FVTPL|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any markup or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.|
|---|---|
|Financial assets at amortised cost|These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Markup, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.|
|Debt investments at FVOCI|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and is assessed for impairment under the new ECL model. Markup income is calculated using the effective interest method and includes amortization of premiums and accretion of discount, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in income statement. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to income statement.|
|Equity investments at FVOCI|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are adjusted from the carrying value of investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to income statement.|

The banks are allowed to continue measuring unquoted equity securities at the lower of cost or break-up value up to December 31, 2024. However, The Group shall be required to measure unquoted equity securities at fair value, as required in the IFRS 9 application instructions, with effect from January 1, 2025.

# 4.1.9 Modification

Financial assets

The Group sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of loans to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognized and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs.
---
If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the Group plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the Group first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognized the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred, and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

# Financial liabilities

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability recognized and consideration paid is recognized in profit or loss. Consideration paid includes non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability.

If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. For floating-rate financial liabilities, the original effective interest rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs and fees incurred are recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument.

# 4.1.10 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’).

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognized are in 'Stage 1'; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in 'Stage 2'; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in 'Stage 3'. Under the SBP's instructions, the Group is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency.

Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 and SBP's IFRS 9 application instructions, the Group has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12-month ECL, Stage1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2).
---
# 4.1.10 EAD and LGD

- EAD: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortization, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.
- LGD: An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Group expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

# 4.1.11 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Group used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations. A financial asset is transitioned to a backward stage in line with SBP instructions.

# 4.1.12 Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Group has adopted a governance framework requiring multiple functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. The Risk Department defines the staging criteria for the new impairment model and take ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach. Additionally, the Risk department also take the ownership of the impact of ECL on Group's capital.

The Group's Finance Division performs ECL calculation. As a result, the department then assess the financial impact, meet the financial reporting requirements and further monitor the impact on the financial ratios.

As per the Group's policy, the Group's Internal Audit function carries out periodic review of IFRS 9 methodology and impacts calculated by the Management.

# 4.2 Revised format of condensed interim financial statements

The SBP through its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 9, 2023, and BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, has amended the format of quarterly and half yearly financial statements of banks. All banks are directed to prepare their quarterly and half yearly financial statements on the revised format effective from accounting year starting from January 1, 2024.

Accordingly, the Group has prepared these condensed interim consolidated financial statements on the new format prescribed by the SBP.

The adoption of revised format has resulted in following significant changes:

- Right-of-use-assets (note 12) amounting to Rs 9,853,577 thousand (December 31, 2023: Rs 8,312,812 thousand) which were previously shown as part of fixed assets are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.
- Lease liabilities (note 20) amounting to Rs 11,708,740 thousand (December 31, 2023: Rs 9,699,474 thousand) which were previously shown as part of other liabilities (note 22) are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.

# 5 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The financial risk management objectives and policies adopted by the Group are consistent with those disclosed in the audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 34.1 Tax status and contingencies

# i Askari Bank Limited

a) During the year ended December 31 2023, the Federal Government issued S.R.O 1588 (l)/2023 on 21 November 2023 under section 99D of the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, whereby the banking sector was specified the sector for the payment of additional tax on windfall income. Through said S.R.O, the Federal Government also specified the method to determine windfall income, tax rate to be applied on such windfall income and tax years under scope. The Group has challenged the S.R.O through petition before the Honorable Islamabad High Court with regards to retrospective application of Section 99D of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for tax years 2022 and 2023. The Honorable Islamabad High Court through its order dated 30 November 2023 has suspended the operation of S.R.O.1588 (l)/2023 and the said injunctive order continues to operate till date of next hearing for which no date has been fixed yet. Management based on the legal advisor opinion believes that the Group has reasonably good chance to succeed in this case and therefore has not recognized any provision in the financial statements. Additional tax on windfall income for tax years 2022 and 2023 is estimated to be Rs. 2,189 million.

b) The Group has filed tax returns for and up to tax year 2024. The assessments for and up to tax year 2023 were amended by the tax authorities creating accumulated additional tax demand, mainly in the matters of admissibility of recoveries against doubtful debts for Rs 1,119 million, provision for diminution in the value of investments for Rs 3,144.44 million, bad debts written off for Rs 242.892 million, provision for substandard advances for Rs 74.95 million, Provision against other assets/fixed assets for Rs 145.81 million, disallowance of employee benefit expenses Rs 228.680 Million, disallowance of depreciation on lease assets Rs 773.88 and other disallowances of expenses/credits for Rs 551.78 million. Group’s Appeals against these orders are currently pending before Commissioner Appeals, Appellate Tribunal and Islamabad High Court. The management and tax advisor of the Group are confident that these matters will be decided in favor of the Group and consequently no provision has been made thereon. Tax payments by the Group against certain matters are being carried forward as receivable, as management and tax advisor of the Group are confident of their realization.

c) Consequent upon the amalgamation with and into the Group, the outstanding tax issues relating to Askari Leasing Limited (ALL) are as follows: Tax returns of ALL have been filed for and up to tax year 2010. The returns for the tax years 2003 to 2010 were amended by the tax authorities mainly in the matter of admissibility of initial allowance claimed on leased vehicles. On appeals filed by ALL, partial relief was provided by the CIR(A) by allowing initial allowance on commercial vehicles. Re-assessment has not yet been carried out by the tax department. A tax demand is however not likely to arise after re-assessment. For and up to the assessment years 2002-2003, reference applications filed by the tax authorities in the matter of computation of lease income are pending decisions by the High Court. However, the likelihood of an adverse decision is considered low due to a favorable decision of the High Court in a parallel case.

# ii Subsidiaries

a) The Appellate Tribunal, Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) established Sindh Sales Tax liability of Rs. 34.225 million along with levy of default surcharge for the periods 2012-13 and 2013-14 on the basis of brokerage income disclosed in the financial statements of the aforesaid periods. The aforementioned tax demand represents the tax liability which the Company has already discharged with the other tax regulator i.e. Federal Board of Revenue and Punjab Revenue Authority during the periods 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-2014. The Company has filed reference and obtained stay order before the Sindh High Court, against the order passed by the Appellate Tribunal. The case was instituted on June 10, 2020. The legal advisor expects an equitable outcome of the cases.

Sales tax demand was raised on the similar basis in past pertaining to periods 2011-12 by Appellate Tribunal. The Company has already discharged the liability in accordance with the provisions of law and a reference has been filed in Sindh High Court. Based on this, the tax advisors of the Company are of the view that matter related to periods 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-2014 will hopefully be decided in the favour of the Company. The case was instituted on July 10, 2017. The legal advisor expects an equitable outcome of the cases.

Similar Case has filled against Islamabad Branch Office (Formally ASL) Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) has assessed demand of Rs 44.36 million on account of Sales Tax for the tax years 2015-2020. The tax was already deposited with Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the matter involves jurisdiction between SRB and FBR. The Company has filed an appeal against the demand and is confident to win the appeal. No tax provision has been recorded in this respect.

# 36. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as Amortised Cost, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as Amortised Cost are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term advances, fixed term deposits and borrowings, other assets and other liabilities cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings, are frequently repriced.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in these consolidated financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

# 36.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets (Pakistan Stock Exchange) for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) available at MUFAP and Reuters page.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2 and level 3:

|Federal Government Securities|The fair values of Federal Government Securities are determined on the basis of rates / prices sourced from Reuters.|
|---|---|
|Non Government Debt Securities|Non Government Debt Securities are valued on the basis of rates announced by Mutual Fund Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).|
|Foreign Government Debt Securities|Foreign Government Debt Securities are valued on the basis of rates taken from custodian of the securities which are usually drawn from Bloomberg.|
|Unit of Mutual Funds|Fair values of mutual funds are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of reporting period.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions|The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.|
|Fixed Assets and Non Banking Assets Acquired in Satisfaction of Claims|Land and Non Banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are valued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessments of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.|
