# Credit Rating

Alhamdolillah, Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) has maintained the Bank's long term entity and short term entity ratings at AAA (Triple A) and A1+ (A One plus), respectively. This long term credit rating AAA (Triple A) denotes the highest credit quality with the lowest expectation of credit risk, and indicates exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.

The ratings of our unsecured, subordinated Term Finance Certificates (TFCs) are AAA (Triple A) for TFC 2021 and TFC-2022, and AA+ (Double A plus) for TFC-2017 (perpetual) and TFC-2022 (perpetual). These ratings denote a very low expectation of credit risk emanating from a very strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments. Further, the TFC-2022 & the TFC-2022 (perpetual) issued in 2022, were listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pursuant to Chapter 5C of PSX Rule Book.

# Future Outlook

In FY 2024, Pakistan’s economy showed resilience with GDP growth of 2.5%, rebounding from a 0.2% contraction in FY 2023. The recovery was led by the agricultural sector, which benefitted from post-flood soil enrichment and other supporting factors, and recorded a growth of 6.2% compared with 2.2% in the previous year. The services sector expanded by 2.4%, mainly due to wholesale and retail trade, after remaining flat in FY 2023. The industrial sector posted a decline of 1.7% compared with a decline of 3.8% in the previous year; the improvement came mainly from the manufacturing sector, which recorded a growth of 3.1% compared with a decline of 5.3% in the year before. Fiscal position improved with decline in fiscal deficit by one percentage point to 6.8% of GDP. During the fiscal year, current account deficit almost halved to USD 1.7 billion, total foreign exchange reserves rose by over 50% to USD 14.0 billion, and the Rupee was stabilized against USD. Inflation came down sharply from 29.4% in June 2023 to 12.6% in June 2024 and 4.1% in December 2024. SBP’s Policy Rate was reduced from 22.0% in June 2023 to 20.50% by June 2024 and 13.0% by December 2024. PSX-100 Index rose by over 80% in CY 2024, making PSX one of the best-performing stock markets of the world.

The above developments point to further potential growth in economic activity in CY 2025. In particular, lowering of interest rates and stability of the Rupee are expected to encourage expansion of business, trade, and investment. Recent data on quarterly GDP indicate that the economy posted an overall growth of 0.9% in the first quarter of FY 2025 due to positive growth in agriculture and services. However, challenges remain, as indicated by decline in production of major crops and contraction in industrial and large scale manufacturing sectors. Moreover, inflation may pick up when the base effect fades later during the year. As regards banks, lower interest rates may erode their net interest margins and profits.

Nevertheless, as in the past, we will continue to be guided by our time-tested principles of prudence and cautious approach, and will continue to work towards achieving sustainable growth and progress in the year ahead, InshaAllah.

# Auditors

The present auditors KPMG Taseer Hadi & Co., Chartered Accountants, retire and offer themselves for reappointment. As suggested by the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors has recommended their reappointment as auditors of the Bank for the year ending December 31, 2025, at a fee to be mutually agreed.

# Risk Management Framework

The Bank’s Risk Management Framework is commensurate with the size of the Bank and the nature of its business. This framework has developed over the years and continues to be refined and improved. A key guiding principle of the Bank is to treat the depositors’ money as a trust which must be protected. Therefore, the Bank aims to take business risks in a prudent manner, guided by a conservative outlook. Salient features of the Bank’s risk management framework are summarized below:

- Credit risk is managed through the credit policies approved by the Board, a well-defined credit approval mechanism; use of internal risk ratings; prescribed documentation requirements; post-disbursement credit administration processes; review, and monitoring of credit facilities; and continuous assessment of credit worthiness of counterparties. The Bank has also established a mechanism for independent, post-disbursement review of large credit risk exposures. As part of the credit appraisal process, environmental and social risks are also assessed to mitigate potential impacts. Decisions regarding the credit portfolio are taken mainly by the Central Credit Committee. The Credit Risk Management Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Bank’s credit risk.
- Market risk is managed through the Market Risk Policy and Treasury & Investment Policy approved by the Board; approval of counterparty limits and dealer limits; and regular review and monitoring of the investment portfolio by the Bank’s Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO). In addition, the Liquidity Risk Policy provides guidance in managing the liquidity position of the Bank, which is monitored on daily basis by the Treasury and the Middle Office. Decisions regarding the investment portfolio are taken mainly by ALCO. Risk Management Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Bank’s market and liquidity risks, capital adequacy, and integrated risk management (also known as Enterprise Risk Management). Assessment of enterprise-wide integrated risk profile of the Bank is carried out, using the Basel Framework, Key Risk Indicators, Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, Stress Testing, and Recovery Plan which are reviewed on an annual basis. The Bank continued to be selected as “Sample D-SIB” - (Domestic Systemically Important Bank) by SBP in year 2024, as in the previous years.
- Operational risk is managed through the Audit Policy, the Operational Risk Policy, the Compliance Policy & Programme, IT and IT Security policies, Human Resource Policy, Consumer Protection Framework, and Outsourcing Policy approved by the Board, along with the Fraud Prevention Policy; Consumer Grievance Handling Policy; operational manuals and procedures issued from time to time; a system of internal controls and dual authorization for important transactions and safe-keeping; a Business Continuity Plan, including a Disaster Recovery Plan for I.T.; and regular audit of the branches and divisions. Key tools such as Key Risk Indicators, risk evaluation of products and processes and operational loss data management are used to monitor and manage operational risk. Audit Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Bank’s operational risk.
- The Bank has taken various steps in adopting green banking measures for improving environmental impact, social risk management, and optimizing resource utilization.

In addition, Risk Management Policy, Risk Tolerance Statement, and Country Risk Management Policy provide further guidance on managing the potential risk exposures of the Bank.

# Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) & Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I)

Your Bank is fully committed to the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility and fulfills this responsibility by engaging in a wide range of activities which include:

# Shariah Board Meetings

During the year, four meetings of the Shariah Board were held and the attendance of each member was as follows:

|Name of Member|Meetings Held|Meetings Attended|
|---|---|---|
|Mufti Ismatullah Hamdullah, Chairman|4|4|
|Mufti Mohib ul Haq, Member|4|4|
|Mufti Sher Ali, Resident Member|4|4|
|Mufti Muhammad Hamza, Member|4|4|

The Bank had engaged KPMG Taseer Hadi & Co. to assist in developing the draft of remuneration policy, keeping in view the culture and values of the Bank, and other related matters.

Additionally, performance evaluation of the Board is to be conducted by an external independent evaluator at least every three years. The Bank has appointed Pakistan Institute of Corporate Governance (PICG) for external independent evaluation of the full Board, Individual Directors, Board Committees, the Chairman, and the Chief Executive.

There is no conflict of interest between the experts hired by the Bank and any Board member or Key Executive.

# Disclosure relating to the Remuneration Policy:

Key objectives of Remuneration Policy are to:

- Attract, retain, and develop competent employees.
- Identify senior Risk Takers and Controllers.
- Offer remuneration that is fair and competitive.
- Encourage behaviour and practices, consistent with the Bank’s Strategy, Vision, Mission, Values, and Guiding Principles.
- Discourage material risk taking.
- Avoid any conflict of interest between the employee and the Bank.
- Establish a management structure to administer and oversee implementation of this Policy.

Bank AL Habib has low tolerance for risk and is averse to taking material risks, i.e., risks that can have a material adverse impact on its business and financial position. Therefore, the Bank does not have any defined Bonus Policy (in any form like cash, stocks, stock options, or other types of incentive pay) to incentivise achievement of performance targets, which may prompt material risk taking. Accordingly, a fundamental principle of the Bank is that employee remuneration is paid in the form of Fixed Remuneration. This has enabled the Bank to maintain sustainable growth and profitability over the years, with a low risk profile and low staff turnover.

There are management committees/senior employees who are authorized to approve risk exposures involving large amounts and deal with other institutionally important matters. They are designated as Senior Risk Takers, who are responsible not only for taking risks, but also for mitigating, monitoring, and controlling the risks taken by the Bank. The Bank encourages and emphasizes risk control, rather than risk taking, which means that control responsibilities take precedence for employees at all levels. Therefore, in case of Senior Risk Takers also, their control responsibilities are paramount and take precedence over their other responsibilities.

Risk Controllers are employees whose professional activities include review, identification, mitigation, and control of risks to which the Bank may be exposed, or providing assistance or assurance related to such activities. Risk control is the responsibility of all functional units of the Bank, including various functions at Principal Office who provide input to line functions on risk management and control, assist them in designing and implementing adequate controls, and independently monitor that the prescribed controls and limits are being complied with.

It is a key principle of employee appraisal that employees must not get penalized or suffer as a consequence of carrying out control activities for which they are institutionally responsible and duly authorized. Any deviation from this principle will be taken very seriously.

# Key criteria for evaluation of performance are as follows:

- Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
- Commitment to the Bank’s Vision, Mission, and Values.
- Compliance with the Bank’s risk and control policies, procedures, and limits.
- Behaviour with customers and colleagues.
- Knowledge and quality of work.
- New ideas and suggestions.
- Growth of business and profitability vs. business objectives (as applicable).
- Persistence and productivity.
- Job performance.
- Teamwork and People Development.

Fixed Remuneration is determined on the basis of role and responsibility of the individual, professional expertise and experience, job performance, and potential for growth. In addition, all employees of the Bank are required to carry out their duties with due care and in an ethical manner. They must act in accordance with the Bank’s Strategy, Vision, Mission, Values, Guiding Principles, Code of Conduct, Policies and Procedures, within the authorities and limits delegated to them. This means that protection of the Bank’s reputation, trustworthiness, and safety is of paramount importance and takes precedence over profit maximization.

Risk management policies, together with the Risk Tolerance Statement, authorities, and limits approved by the Board, provide the necessary guidance on risk taking activities of the Bank. Actions taken and decisions made by the employees are institutionally owned and protected by the Bank, as long as these are within the ambit of the prescribed policies and procedures and there is no evidence of self-dealing.

Governance of remuneration is accomplished through a formal structure which includes: Board of Directors; Human Resource & Remuneration Committee; Chief Executive; Human Resource Division; and Finance, Audit, Compliance, and Risk Management Divisions.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REVIEW REPORT

To the members of Bank AL Habib Limited

# Review Report on the Statement of Compliance contained in Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019

We have reviewed the enclosed Statement of Compliance with the Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019 (the Regulations) prepared by the Board of Directors of Bank AL Habib Limited (“the Bank”) for the year ended 31 December 2024 in accordance with the requirements of Regulation No. 36 of the Regulations.

The responsibility for compliance with the Regulations is that of the Board of Directors of the Bank. Our responsibility is to review whether the Statement of Compliance reflects the status of the Bank's compliance with the provisions of the Regulations and report if it does not and to highlight any non-compliance with the requirements of the Regulations. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of the Bank's personnel and review of various documents prepared by the Bank to comply with the Regulations.

As a part of our audit of the financial statements we are required to obtain an understanding of the accounting and internal control systems sufficient to plan the audit and develop an effective audit approach. We are not required to consider whether the Board of Directors' statement on internal control covers all risks and controls or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of such internal controls, the Bank's corporate governance procedures and risks.

The Regulations require the Bank to place before the Audit Committee, and upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, place before the Board of Directors for their review and approval, of its related party transactions. We are only required and have ensured compliance of this requirement to the extent of the approval of the related party transactions by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the Statement of Compliance does not appropriately reflect the Bank's compliance, in all material respects, with the requirements contained in the Regulations as applicable to the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2024.

# STATEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS

The Management of the Bank is responsible for establishing the Internal Control System with the main objectives of ensuring effectiveness and efficiency of operations; reliability of financial reporting; safeguarding of assets; and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Internal Control System has evolved over the years, as it is an ongoing process and is included in the Bank’s policies, procedures, financial limits, etc., as detailed in various manuals, circulars and instructions issued by the Bank. This system continues to be reviewed, refined and improved from time to time and immediate corrective action is taken to minimize risks which are inherent in banking business and operations.

The Internal Control System is reviewed by the Internal Auditors as well as External Auditors and their findings and recommendations are reported to the management and to the Audit Committee of the Board, and corrective action is taken to address control deficiencies and for improving procedures and systems as they are identified. The Board, acting through the Audit Committee, provides supervision and overall guidance in improving the effectiveness of the Internal Control System.

While the Internal Control System is effectively implemented and monitored, there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system, including the possibility of human error or system failure and circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective Internal Control System can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that the system’s objectives will be achieved.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) aims to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with the applicable financial reporting standards. During the year, Internal Auditors tested the Bank’s ICFR and reported their findings to the management and the Audit Committee of the Board. While no material deficiencies were detected, indicating that ICFR is effectively implemented in the Bank, it may be reiterated that any control system can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that its objectives will be achieved.

In accordance with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) directives, the Bank has completed all the stages of ICFR. Upon satisfactory completion of ICFR roadmap, the Bank has been granted exemption by SBP from the requirement of submission of Long Form Report by the External Auditors.

The Bank has endeavored to follow the guidelines issued by SBP on internal controls. Updation and review of ICFR exercise for the year 2024 as per SBP Guidelines on Internal Controls has been successfully completed. In accordance with SBP directives, the annual assessment report for the year 2024 is being prepared. Evaluation and management of significant risks is an ongoing process and we will make further efforts to improve our Internal Control System during 2025.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the members of Bank AL Habib Limited

# Report on the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# Opinion

We have audited the annexed unconsolidated financial statements of Bank AL Habib Limited (the Bank), which comprise the unconsolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2024, and the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account, the unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, the unconsolidated statement of changes in equity and unconsolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended, along with unaudited certified returns received from the branches except for 45 branches which have been audited by us and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information and we state that we have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purposes of the audit.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the unconsolidated statement of financial position, the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account, the unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, the unconsolidated statement of changes in equity and unconsolidated cash flow statement together with the notes forming part thereof conform with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, and, give the information required by the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017), in the manner so required and respectively give a true and fair view of the state of the Bank’s affairs as at 31 December 2024 and of the profit and other comprehensive income, the changes in equity and its cash flow for the year then ended.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Pakistan. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants as adopted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (the Code) and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to Note 4.25 to the unconsolidated financial statements which indicates that the comparative information presented as at year ended and for year ended 31 December 2023 has been restated. Our opinion has not been modified in respect of this matter.

# Key Audit Matter

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# Key Audit Matter

|S.No.|Key Audit Matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|Valuation of Advances: (Refer note 9 & 21 to the unconsolidated financial statements)|As at 31 December 2024, the Bank’s Credit loss allowance against advances and off-balance sheet items amounting to Rs. 48,462 million and Rs. 4,742 million respectively. As per the BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023, the Bank adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions issued by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) from 01 January 2024 which requires the Bank to recognize Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on advances including non-funded exposure. The estimation of ECL on advances including non-funded exposure, involves judgement and complexity. The key areas which are subject to management judgement in the estimation of ECL are: - Model estimations – judgmental modelling and assumption are used to estimate ECL which involves determining Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD). Respective model assumption is a key driver of complexity and uncertainty and are required in the application of these model for calculation of the ECL estimate.
- Economic scenarios – IFRS 9 requires the Bank to measure ECL on an unbiased forward-looking basis reflecting a range of future economic conditions. Management judgement is applied in determining the forward-looking economic scenarios used as an input to calculate ECL, the associated scenario probability weightings, and the key economic variables that drive the scenarios.
- Qualitative criteria – the criteria selected to identify a SICR involves judgment and can lead to unreliable ECL recognized for certain portfolios.
In line with the application instructions as issued by SBP for IFRS 9, the Bank must compare the ECL for Stage 3 advances with the provision determined under the Prudential Regulations (PR) issued by the SBP. The PR requires specific provisioning against the advances on the basis of time-based criteria which should be supplemented by a subjective evaluation of Bank’s credit portfolio. The determination of provision against advances, therefore, involves use of management’s judgement, on a case-to-case basis, taking into account factors such as the economic and business conditions, borrowers’ repayment behaviors and realizability of collateral held by the Bank. - Our audit procedures, amongst others, included the following:
- Performing risk assessment procedures over the credit loss allowance against advances and off-balance sheet exposure within the Bank’s unconsolidated financial statement. As part of these risk assessment procedures, identifying the portfolios associated with a risk of material misstatement including those arising from judgements over the estimation of ECL either due to inputs, methods or assumption.
- Assessing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls established by the Bank over measurement of ECL and provision calculated as per PR.
- We involved in-house specialist who assisted in the following: - Evaluating the Bank’s impairment methodologies for compliance with application instructions as issued by SBP for IFRS 9;
- Assessing the reasonableness of the Bank’s methodology and models for determining the economic scenarios used and the probability weightings applied to them by independently validating and challenging the assumption, methodologies, and outputs of the models;
- Assessing the reasonableness of macro-economic variable and economic forecasts by comparing these to external sourced data extracted;
- Performing independent testing of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) allowance on a sample basis.
- Ensuring completeness of the key inputs into the ECL calculations with their respective sub-ledgers and general ledgers.
- Performing testing on sample basis over key inputs into the ECL calculations with their respective source documents.
- Performing sensitivity analysis on the key assumption, that is probability weighted economic scenarios, to assess reasonableness and the risk of biasness by changing weights assigned to each economic scenario.
- In accordance with the PR, we sampled at least sixty percent of the total advances portfolio and performed credit review through the following substantive procedures:
|

# Key Audit Matter

|S.No.|Key Audit Matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|Because of the high degree of estimation uncertainty and judgement involved in the calculation of ECL we considered the area of ECL provision as a key audit matter.|- Verifying repayments of advances/mark-up installments and checked that non-performing advances have been correctly classified and categorized based on the number of days overdue;
- Examining watch list accounts and, based on review of the individual facts and circumstances, discussions with management and our assessment of financial conditions of the borrowers, formed a judgement as to whether classification of these accounts as performing was appropriate;
- Assessing the accuracy of specific provision made against non-performing advances in accordance with the criteria prescribed under the PRs by performing recalculation.
- Assessing the appropriateness of SICR criteria applied by the Bank by ensuring that the SICR criteria and staging methodology are consistent with the relevant application instructions as issued by SBP for IFRS 9.
- Assessing the appropriateness of ECL on advances categorized as Stage 3 by performing a comparison of ECL computed, through the use of methodology and models with the provision required to be computed as required under the PR to ensure that an amount which is higher of the ECL and PR requirements is appropriately recognized for these stage 3 advances pursuant to the requirement of application instructions as issued by SBP for IFRS 9.
- Evaluating the adequacy of the financial statement disclosures, including disclosures of key assumptions, judgements and sensitivities.

# Information other than the Unconsolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The Other Information comprises the Annual Report of the Bank but does not include the unconsolidated financial statements, consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s reports thereon.

Our opinion on the unconsolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the unconsolidated financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the unconsolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the unconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the unconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

1. Based on our audit, we further report that in our opinion:
1. proper books of account have been kept by the Bank/branches as required by the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and the returns referred above from the branches have been found adequate for the purpose of our audit;
2. the unconsolidated statement of financial position, the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account, unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated statement of changes in equity and unconsolidated statement of cash flows together with the notes thereon have been drawn up in conformity with the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and are in agreement with the books of account and returns;
3. investments made, expenditure incurred and guarantees extended during the year were in accordance with the objects and powers of the Bank / branches and the transactions of the Bank / branches which have come to our notice have been within the powers of the Bank / branches; and
4. zakat deductible at source under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance, 1980 (XVIII of 1980), was deducted by the Bank and deposited in the Central Zakat Fund established under section 7 of that Ordinance.
2. We confirm that for the purpose of our audit we have covered more than sixty per cent of the total loans and advances of the Bank.

# Other Matter relating to comparative information

The unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank as at and for the year ended 31 December 2023, excluding the adjustments described in Note 4.25 to the unconsolidated financial statements were audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those unconsolidated financial statements on 13 February 2024.

As part of our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2024, we audited the adjustments described in Note 4.25 that were applied to restate the comparative information presented as at and for the year ended 31 December 2023. We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, other than with respect to the adjustments described in Note 4.25 to the unconsolidated financial statements.

Accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on those financial statements taken as a whole. However, in our opinion, the adjustments described in Note 4.25 are appropriate and have been properly applied.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Muhammad Taufiq.

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024

# 1. STATUS AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

The branch network of the Bank includes 02 overseas branches (2023: 02 overseas branches) and 276 Islamic Banking branches (2023: 201 Islamic Banking branches).

# 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

# 2.1

In accordance with the directives of the Federal Government regarding the shifting of the banking system to Islamic modes, SBP has issued various circulars from time to time. Permissible forms of trade-related modes of financing includes purchase of goods by banks from customers and immediate resale to them at appropriate mark-up in price on deferred payment basis. The purchase and resale arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these unconsolidated financial statements as such, but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilised and the appropriate portion of mark-up thereon. However, the Islamic Banking branches of the Bank have complied with the requirements set out under the Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS), issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2017.

# 2.2

Key financial information of the Islamic Banking branches is disclosed in Annexure II to these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 2.3

These financial statements are presented in Pak Rupees which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency and represent separate financial statements of the Bank in which investments in subsidiaries and associates are stated at cost less provision for impairment, if any and are not consolidated or accounted for by using equity method of accounting.

# 2.4

The Bank believes that there is no significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the unconsolidated financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.

# 2.5 Statement of compliance

# 2.5.1

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards comprise of:

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- IFAS issued by ICAP, as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by SBP and SECP differ with the requirements of the IFRS or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

# 2.5.2

The disclosures made in these unconsolidated financial statements have been based on a format prescribed by SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 02 dated 09 February 2023 with further addition made vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 13 of 2024, dated 01 July 2024 and accounting and financial reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan.

# 2.5.3

SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment Property' for Banking Companies in Pakistan through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated 26 August 2002 till further instructions. Also, SECP has deferred the applicability of IFRS 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' through its notification S.R.O 411 (I) / 2008 dated 28 April 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 2.5.4

The disclosures requirements of IFAS 3, 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits' for Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) relating to annual and quarterly financial statements have been based on a format prescribed by SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 02 dated 09 February 2023.

# 2.5.5

IFRS 10, 'Consolidated Financial Statements' was made applicable from period beginning on or after 01 January 2015 vide S.R.O 633 (I) / 2014 dated 10 July 2014 by SECP. However, SECP has directed through S.R.O 56 (I) / 2016 dated 28 January 2016 that the requirement of consolidation under section 228 of the Companies Act, 2017 and IFRS 10, 'Consolidated Financial Statements' is not applicable in case of investment by companies in mutual funds established under trust structure.

# 2.5.6

These unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank are prepared using generally consistent accounting policies. However, as per SBP IFRS 9 application instructions, overseas branches comply with the local regulations enforced within their respective jurisdictions under IFRS 9.

# 2.5.7

As per BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated 29 July 2024, unlisted equity securities are currently carried at the lower of cost or breakup value as per the exemption granted by SBP. Effective from 01 January 2025, as per the requirement of IFRS 9, these will be measured at fair value under IFRS 13.

# 2.5.8

The Bank received an extension from SBP up to 31 December 2025 for application of EIR in general for all financial assets and liabilities (excluding staff loans / subsidized loans), however as financial assets other than advances and financial liabilities were already effectively carried at EIR before the implementation of IFRS 9 hence said extension has only been applied on advances (excluding staff loans / subsidized loans i.e. Temporary Economic Refinance Facility). Therefore, advances are now carried at cost, excluding staff loans, TERF and advances pertaining to overseas operations, which are carried at amortized cost, net of expected credit loss allowances.

Further, SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 dated 22 January 2025 has clarified the followings:

- Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) are allowed to follow Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) 1 & 2 where applicable and continue the existing accounting methodology on other Islamic products until issuance of further instruction in this regard.
- The treatment of charity should be in line with the existing practices as defined in SBP instructions issued via IBD Circular No. 02 of 2008 and should not be recognized as income.

# 2.5.9

All Islamic products are governed by the product manual approved by the Shariah Board of the Bank. The related accounting and revenue recognition policies are outlined in notes 4.5.3, 4.16.2 and 4.16.3 of these unconsolidated financial statements, respectively. However, in case of Ijarah and Murhaba, the Bank has also complied with the requirements of IFAS 1 and IFAS 2. Other than the products disclosed in the aforementioned notes, all remaining Islamic products are accounted for under IFRS 9.

# 2.5.10

Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published approved accounting standards that are effective in the current year.

As directed by SBP via BPRD Circular Letter No. 7 of 2023 dated 13 April 2023, IFRS 9, (Financial Instruments) is effective in Pakistan for period beginning on or after 01 January 2024. In addition, due to the application of IFRS 9, SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 02 dated 09 February 2023, has also amended the format of the annual financial statements. Details regarding the aforementioned adoption and amendment, including the impact thereof, are discussed in more detail in note 4.1 to these unconsolidated financial statements.

Except for the above, there are certain other interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank’s accounting periods beginning 01 January 2024. However, these are not considered to be relevant or do not have any significant effect on the Bank's operations and therefore have not been detailed in these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 2.5.11 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published approved accounting standards that are not yet effective

|Standards and amendments|Effective date (accounting periods beginning on or after)|
|---|---|
|- IAS 21 - Lack of exchangeability – (Amendments)|01 January 2025|

|Standard|IASB effective date (accounting periods beginning on or after)|
|---|---|

# 2.5.12 Critical accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions

The preparation of unconsolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires the use of certain accounting estimates. It also requires the management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Bank's accounting policies. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The areas where various assumptions and estimates are significant to the Bank's unconsolidated financial statements or where judgement was exercised in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

| |Note|
|---|---|
|- Valuation and impairment of financial instruments|4.1.2.10, 9|
|- Classification of investment in associates|46.1.7 & 46.1.8|
|- Valuation and depreciation of property and equipment|4.6 & 10|
|- Valuation and depreciation of right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities|4.7, 11 & 19|
|- Valuation of non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|4.8 & 14|
|- Valuation of defined benefit plan|4.11 & 38|
|- Valuation of compensated absences|4.11 & 21|
|- Taxation|4.17 & 13|
|- Fair value of derivatives|4.13 & 25|

Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

# 3. BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain investments and derivatives which are carried at fair value. Lands and buildings classified under property and equipment and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amount. Employee benefits and lease liability against right-of-use assets are carried at present value.

# 4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, except as disclosed in note 4.1 below.

# 4.1 Changes in accounting policies

# 4.1.1 Revised format of unconsolidated financial statements

SBP through its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated 09 February 2023, has amended the format of annual financial statements of banks. All banks are required to prepare their annual financial statements on the revised format effective from accounting year starting from 01 January 2024. Accordingly, the Bank has prepared

these unconsolidated financial statements on the new format prescribed by SBP. The adoption of the new format contains additional disclosures and certain changes in the financial statements’ presentation, primarily due to the implementation of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan. However, the corresponding figures continue to be classified and disclosed in accordance with the previous financial accounting and reporting framework.

Adoption of revised financial statements format has also resulted in following material changes (due to which the corresponding presentations have also been changed):

- Right-of-use-assets (note 11) amounting to Rs. 13,679.198 million (2023: Rs. 11,969.724 million) which were previously shown as part of property and equipment are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.
- Lease liabilities (note 19) amounting to Rs. 16,848.698 million (2023: Rs. 14,441.482 million) which were previously shown as part of other liabilities are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.

# 4.1.2 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

During the year, as directed by SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated 13 April 2023, IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments' (the Standard) became applicable to the Bank.

BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated 05 July 2022 issued by SBP provides detailed instructions on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks.

The Standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions from 01 January 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognized in retained earnings and reserves as at 01 January 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard. Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9.

SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated 29 July 2024, has amended and extended the timelines for application instructions. Under the revised guidelines, banks are required to implement modification accounting for financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the Standard. These changes took effect from 01 October 2024, and have been applied retrospectively from 01 January 2024. SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 dated 22 January 2025, SBP further clarifies that modification accounting to be applied to loans modified on or after 01 January 2020.

# 4.1.2.1.1

As per paragraph 3.2 of the Application Instructions, Government securities in local currency are exempted from the application of ECL framework, details are mentioned in note 4.1.2.10 to these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 4.1.2.1.2

Certain debt securities are held by the Bank in separate portfolios to meet everyday liquidity needs. The Bank seeks to minimise the costs of managing these liquidity needs and therefore actively manages the return on the portfolio. That return consists of collecting contractual payments as well as gains and losses from the sale of financial assets. The investment strategy often results in sales activity that is significant in value. The Bank considers that under IFRS 9 these securities are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.

# 4.1.2.1.3

These financial assets are held by overseas branches. As per paragraph 1.2 of the Application Instruction, in relation to overseas branches, IFRS 9 will be applicable based on their respective host country’s regulatory accounting practices. Since IFRS 9 was already applicable to overseas branches as at 01 January 2024, there is no impact of IFRS 9 adoption on these financial assets.

# 4.1.2.1.4

The Bank previously classified certain equity investments as Available-for-Sale (AFS). Upon implementing IFRS 9, the Bank designated these equity investments as strategic and made an irrevocable election to classify them at FVOCI.

# 4.1.2.1.5

This includes puttable instrument that can be put back at any time for cash equal to a proportionate share of the net asset value of an entity. These assets are therefore mandatorily classified at FVPL under IFRS 9.

# 4.1.2.1.6

Certain debt securities are held by the Bank in a separate portfolio for long-term yield. These securities may be sold, but such sales are not expected to be more than infrequent. The Bank considers that these securities are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect the contractual cash flows. These assets are classified as measured at amortised cost under IFRS 9.

# 4.1.2.1.7

This includes expected credit loss against off-balance sheet items.

# 4.1.2.2

Impact on regulatory capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the Banks, which has reduced their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the Application Instructions issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement. The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for Stage 1 and Stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the “transitional adjustment amount”) must be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the “transition period” of five years.

Moreover, SBP has allowed to adjust the amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions in Tier 2 Capital that have not been added back to CET 1 and vice versa as per Annexure A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024 dated 29 July 2024. Had IFRS 9 not been applied then CAR would have been higher by 7 bps from 17.90 % to 17.97%.

# 4.1.2.3 Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) regardless of the business model in which they are held.

# Recognition and initial measurement

Debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at transaction price. The fair value of a financial asset on initial recognition is generally its transaction price. If the Bank determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognized in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account on an appropriate basis over the life of the asset but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data, or the transaction is closed out. Advances other than staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations are initially measured at transaction price i.e., the amount of loan disbursed at disbursement date. Staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) loans and advances pertaining to overseas operations are recognized at fair value at the time of disbursement. The fair value is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using the prevailing market rates for instruments. The difference between the disbursed amount and the fair value at initial recognition is recorded as a prepayment.

# Classification

# Financial assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset other than advances except for staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations is classified as measured at: amortised cost, FVOCI or FVPL.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in scope of the standard are never bifurcated. Instead, the whole hybrid instrument is assessed for classification. Advances are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, excluding staff loans, Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations, which are measured at amortized cost.

# Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit and loss account (FVPL), when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortized cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognized in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortized cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method. Markup expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# 4.1.2.4 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either Held to collect, Held to collect and sale and Others based on Business model assessment. The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The assessment requires judgement based on facts and circumstances on the date of assessment. The assessment considers the policies and objectives for the portfolio of financial assets, risk affecting, performance evaluation, business manager’s compensation and historical sales information.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

# 4.1.2.5 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as interest margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Bank considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Bank considers:

- contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
- leverage features;
- prepayment and extension terms;
- terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and
- features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).

A prepayment feature aligns with SPPI if it mainly represents unpaid principal and profit, including reasonable compensation for early termination.

The Bank holds a portfolio of long-term fixed-rate loans for which the Bank has the option to propose to revise the interest rate at periodic reset dates. These reset rights are limited to the market rate at the time of revision. The borrowers have an option to either accept the revised rate or redeem the loan at par without penalty. The Bank has determined that the contractual cash flows of these loan are SPPI because the option varies the interest rate in a way that is consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and costs associated with the principal amount outstanding.

# 4.1.2.6 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

|Financial assets|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, at FVPL including any markup or dividend income, are recognised in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.|
|---|---|
|Financial assets at amortised cost|These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method in case of investments, lendings to financial institutions, cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks, Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), staff loans, and advances pertaining to overseas operations and other financial assets. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Markup, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.|


# Debt investments

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and is assessed for impairment under the new ECL model. Markup income is calculated using the effective interest method and includes amortisation of premiums and accretion of discount, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit and loss account. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# Equity investments

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are adjusted from the carrying value of investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit and loss account.

# Advances at cost

Advances are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, excluding staff loans, Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations, which are measured at amortized cost, net of expected credit loss allowances.

# 4.1.2.7 Amortised cost and gross carrying amount

The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount for investments and lendings to financial institution. For financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance or impairment allowance before 01 January 2024.

The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

# 4.1.2.8 Calculation of markup income and expense

Income from performing advances of the domestic operations is recognised on accrual basis as per the terms of the contract. However, where debt securities, classified as investments in the financial statements, are purchased at premium or discount, such premium / discount including the transaction cost is amortized through the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account over the remaining maturity of the debt security using the effective interest rate method. The interest income on staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations is recognized in line with the EIR, while any expected credit losses are assessed and accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. Income from advances except for staff loans and TERF are recognized in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account using contractual rate. Similarly, under the local regulatory requirement, income recoverable on classified domestic advances and investments (debt securities), is recognized on a receipt basis.

Income on rescheduled / restructured advances and investments is recognized as permitted by SBP regulations.

In case of overseas operations, income on the financial assets is recognised under the effective interest method or as prescribed by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which the Bank operates.

Markup expense on domestic financial liabilities (comprising deposits, subordinated debts, and borrowings) is recognized on an accrual basis in the period in which it is incurred, based on effective interest rate method. In case of overseas operations, such expense is recognised under the effective interest method or as prescribed by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which the Bank operates.

# 4.1.2.9 Derecognition

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:
- i) substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred; or
- ii) the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognized), and the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in OCI is recognized in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account, except that in case of the derecognition of equity securities held at FVOCI, cumulative gains or losses are transferred to unappropriated profit.

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

# 4.1.2.10 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortized cost, and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), advances at cost and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’).

# Measurement of ECL

ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:

- financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive);
- financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows;
- undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive; and
- financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Bank expects to recover.

# Non-Performing financial assets

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost, at cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit‑impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘non-performing’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- the restructuring of a loan by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise;

it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.

Under SBP's IFRS 9 Application instructions, the Bank is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. The Bank is required to calculate ECL on its non-performing financial assets as higher of provision under Prudential Regulations (PR) and ECL under IFRS 9. Further, the Banks are advised to recognize income on impaired assets (loans classified under PRs i.e., OAEM and Stage 3 loans) on a receipt basis in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations issued by SBP.

The Bank calculates the ECL against corporate, commercial & SME loan portfolios as higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level, whereas against the retail borrowers the Bank calculates the ECL at higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at segment / product basis as instructed under Annexure A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024 dated 29 July 2024.

# Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 Application Instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12-month ECL, Stage1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2). PD is estimated using internal rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk rating. The Bank has used Transition Matrix approach for estimation of PD for each internal rating. The Bank has used roll-rate method using the days past due (DPD) criteria to estimated PD for its retail portfolio. PD are then adjusted with forward looking information for calculation of ECL
- EAD: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant. The Bank estimates EAD for financial assets carried at an amortised cost and carried at cost equal to principal plus profit. Each repayment date is assumed to be default point in the model and the ECL is calculated on EAD at each reporting date and discounted at the effective interest rate or contractual interest rate for advances other than staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations for which effective interest rate is used. Further, cash and cash equivalent collaterals that the Bank holds against the non-retail facilities are adjusted from the LGD.
- LGD: An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

# Presentation of allowance for Expected Credit Loss in the Unconsolidated Statement of Financial Position

Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the unconsolidated statement of financial position as follows:

- Financial assets measured at amortized cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets.
- For advances measured at cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the advances.
- Loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: as a provision in other liabilities.
- where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Bank does not identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component and instead presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision;

- debt instruments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance is recognized in the unconsolidated statement of financial position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance is disclosed and is recognized in OCI.

# 4.1.2.11 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or markup payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PR issued by SBP. Financial assets in Stage 2 may be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum period of 6 months from initial downgrade is required before any facility is moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to move back from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it should meet the criteria defined under the respective Prudential Regulations for de-classification of account / facility. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022. However, banks are free to choose more stringent days past due criteria. Bank align its policy with Annexure-C of BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022; hence, SICR is considered if credit exposure exceeds 60 days past due.

# 4.1.2.12 Undrawn loan commitments and guarantees:

Financial guarantees’ are contracts that require the Bank to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. ‘Loan commitments’ are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions.

When estimating lifetime ECL for undrawn loan commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the loans are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

# 4.1.2.13 Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank has set up a robust governance framework requiring Risk Management, Finance, Business, Credit Risk, Internal Audit and IT functions to ensure compliance with IFRS 9 requirements. The Bank's Credit Division performs credit risk assessment, monitors Significant Increase in Credit Risk of the borrowers, reviews Credit Ratings and obligor attributes.

The IT Division extracts the data required for ECL calculations. IT Division also provide support for system development and upgrades.

The Bank’s Finance Division takes ownership of ECL models and methodologies used in calculation of ECL. Finance Division assess the financial impact, meet the financial reporting requirements and presents quarterly results to Board of Directors (BOD) / its Board Sub Committee.

The Risk Management Division calculates impact of ECL on bank’s capital adequacy, leverage ratio and Liquidity requirements.

As per the Bank's policy, the Bank’s Internal Audit function carries out ECL model validation, reviews IFRS 9 methodology and impact calculated by Finance Division.

# 4.2 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents as referred to in the unconsolidated cash flow statement comprise cash and non restricted balances with treasury and other banks less overdrawn nostros accounts. Restricted balances not available for use if any, are excluded from cash and cash equivalents.

# 4.3 Lendings to / borrowings from financial institutions

The Bank enters into transactions of lendings and borrowings at contracted rates for a specified period of time. These are recorded as under:

# Sale under repurchase obligation

Securities sold with a simultaneous commitment to repurchase at a specified future date (repos) continue to be recognised in the unconsolidated statement of financial position and are measured in accordance with accounting policies for investments. Amounts received under these agreements are recorded as repurchase agreement borrowings. The difference between sale and repurchase price is amortised as expense over the term of the repo agreement. These are initially recognised at amount of funds received and subsequently reported as payable under the contractual terms.

# Purchase under resale obligation

Securities purchased with a corresponding commitment to resale at a specified future date (reverse repos) are not recognised as investments in the unconsolidated statement of financial position. Amounts paid under these arrangements are included in repurchase agreement lendings. The difference between purchase and resale price is accrued as income over the term of the reverse repo agreement. These are initially recognised at amount of funds disbursed and subsequently reported as receivable under the contractual terms.

# Other borrowings

Other borrowings include borrowings from the State Bank of Pakistan and unsecured call borrowings which are recorded at the amount equivalent to proceeds received. Markup is charged on such borrowings to the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account over the period of borrowing using effective interest rate method.

# 4.4 Investments

# Subsidiaries

Subsidiary is an entity over which the Bank has control. Investments in subsidiary is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. The carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists the investment’s recoverable amount is estimated at higher of its value in use and its fair value less cost to sell. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# Associates

Certain mutual funds are managed by AL Habib Asset Management Limited (AHAML), the subsidiary company of the Bank. As stipulated under Regulation 38 of Non-Banking Finance Regulation, 2008, the Asset Management Company (AMC) is entrusted with fiduciary duties towards the unit holders of the funds. This fiduciary obligation requires AMC to act in the best interests of its unit holders, refraining from exploiting opportunities for its own benefit or that of its related parties, group companies, or employees, to the detriment of the unit holders. Therefore, the Bank has significant influence over such mutual funds due to participation in the investee's policy-making processes via the AHAML and investment in such mutual funds is considered as investment in associates. These are not considered subsidiary due to the legal trust structure of the entity, the Bank does not have the ability to affect returns through its power over the investee. Further, under this trust structure, the trusteeship is separate from the management, and the independent trustees play a key role in overseeing the activities of the AMC. The Bank has significant influence over mutual funds where it has holding percentage of less than 20% due to power to participate in the investee's policy-making processes via the AHAML and investment in such mutual funds is considered as investment in associates.

On culmination of murabaha i.e. sale of goods to customers, murabaha receivables are recorded at the sale price net of deferred income. Goods purchased but remaining unsold at the reporting date are recorded as inventories.

# Inventory

The Bank values its inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost necessary to make the sale. Cost of inventories represents actual purchases made by the Bank / customers as an agent of the Bank for subsequent sale. Inventory against each contract is maintained on specific identification method.

# Istisna

In Istisna financing, the Bank places an order to purchase the goods which needs to be manufactured against a fixed price (istisna price). Istisna price may be paid in advance, in installment or at the time of delivery of goods. Once the goods are delivered within the agreed time, the goods are sold by the customer on behalf of the Bank and the amount hence financed along with profit amount realized net of agency fee and incentives is paid to the Bank.

# Diminishing Musharaka

Buildings are carried at revalued amount less any accumulated depreciation and subsequent impairment losses, if any. Land is carried at revalued amount less any subsequent impairment losses, if any.

Depreciation on property and equipment (excluding land which is not depreciated) is charged using the straight line method in accordance with the rates specified in note 10.2 to these unconsolidated financial statements after taking into account residual value. The asset's residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if required, at each reporting date.

Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that the net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. In case of buildings relevant portion of the revaluation reserve is transferred to retained earnings as the asset is depreciated on or its disposal. Valuation techniques and input used are disclosed in note 41 of these unconsolidated financial statements.

An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

# 4.7 Leases

# Bank as a lessee

The Bank enters into lease arrangements principally in respect of office space for its operations. The Bank assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease.

The Bank applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Bank recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

# Right-of-use assets

Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost being the present value of lease payments, initial direct costs, any lease payments made at or before the commencement of the lease as reduced by any incentives received. These are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The right-of-use assets are presented within note 11 of these unconsolidated financial statements.

# Lease liabilities

At the commencement date of the lease, the Bank recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments not paid at the time of commencement of lease. The Bank determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. After the commencement date, the Bank reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control that affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. The Bank cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate to measure lease liabilities. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The lease liability is also remeasured to reflect any reassessment or lease modification. The interest expense is recorded in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account using effective interest rate method.

# 4.8 Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are initially measured at settlement amount and upon revaluation, are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed annually and adjusted, if appropriate. As per SBP's requirement desktop valuation is carried out on annual basis and full-scope valuation after every three years by independent professionally qualified valuers to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. A surplus arising on revaluation of assets is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims' account and any deficit arising on revaluation is taken to unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account directly. Legal fees, transfer costs and direct costs of acquiring title of assets is charged to unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account and not capitalised.

Deposits taken on Qard basis are classified as ‘Current accounts’ and Deposits generated on Modaraba basis are classified as ‘Saving deposits’.

# 4.10 Subordinated debt

# 4.25 Prior Period adjustments

# 4.25.1

During the year, the Bank reassessed its treatment of Deferred Tax Liability (DTL) on the revaluation surplus of land based on a legal opinion. It was determined that revaluation surplus for lands acquired during tax years 2016 to 2019 and from tax year 2023 onward are taxable, and corresponding DTL should be recognized. For other tax years, revaluation surplus are not taxable under applicable tax laws in Pakistan. As a consequence, the DTL was overstated and the corresponding surplus was understated by Rs. 4,635 million. During the year, the Bank reversed DTL previously recognized for non-taxable periods and restated prior period figures in accordance with IAS 8 "Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors". As a result of above, Rs. 3,490 million is now reversed from ‘Deferred tax liability’ with corresponding increase in 'Surplus on revaluation of assets' as at 31 December 2023. Further, this adjustment has resulted in increase in the balance of ‘Deferred tax asset’ at 01 January 2023 by Rs. 1,145 million (net of tax) with corresponding increase in the balance of ‘Surplus on revaluation of assets’ by the same amount. Refer note 4.25.3 for the adjustments and their related impacts.

# 4.25.2

Previously, the Bank had recorded DTL on the taxable temporary difference arising on revaluation surplus of building at the rate enacted on each revaluation date. As a consequence, the deferred tax liability was understated and the corresponding surplus was overstated by Rs. 1,583 million. The management has changed its accounting treatment by calculating DTL on the revaluation surplus of building at the rate enacted at each reporting date. As a result of above, Rs. 1,583 million has now been recognized in ‘Deferred tax liability’ with corresponding decrease in 'Surplus on revaluation of assets' as at 31 December 2023. This change has been applied retrospectively in accordance with the requirement of IAS 8 as disclosed in Note 4.25.3 of these unconsolidated financial statements. In line with IAS 1, the third statement of unconsolidated statement of financial position is not presented as the impact of these matters in the earliest period presented are not material.

# DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN

# General description

The Bank operates an approved gratuity fund for all its confirmed employees, which is administered by the Trustees. The benefits under the gratuity scheme are payable on retirement at the age of 60 years or on earlier cessation of service as under:

|Number of years of eligible service completed|Amount of gratuity payable|
|---|---|
|Less than 5 years|Nil|
|5 years or more but less than 10 years|1/3rd of basic salary for each year served|
|10 years or more but less than 15 years|2/3rd of basic salary for each year served|
|15 years or more|Full basic salary for each year served|

The Bank's costs and contributions are determined based on actuarial valuation carried out at each year end using Projected Unit Credit Actuarial Method. All actuarial gains / losses are recognised in 'other comprehensive income’ as they occur and are not reclassified to unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account in subsequent periods.

# 38.2 Number of employees under the scheme

The number of employees covered under the defined benefit scheme are 17,377 (2023: 16,793).

# 38.3 Principal actuarial assumptions

The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out on 31 December 2024 and the significant assumptions used for actuarial valuation were as follows:

| |2024|2023|
|---|---|---|
|Discount rate|12.25%|15.50%|
|Expected rate of return on plan assets|12.25%|15.50%|

# 38.14 Funding Policy

The Bank will fund the yearly contribution to the defined benefit plan each year, as per the amount calculated by the valuer.

# 38.15 Significant Risk

# Asset Volatility

The Defined Benefit Gratuity Fund is almost entirely invested in Government Bonds with mostly floating income bonds. Almost 87.31% of the total investments (Rs. 7.545 billion) is invested in PIBs. This gives rise to significant reinvestment risk.

The asset class is volatile with reference to the yield on PIBs. This risk should be viewed together with change in the bond yield risk.

# Changes in Bond Yields

There are two dimensions to the changes in bond yields: first, as described above; second, the valuation of the gratuity liability is discounted with reference to these bond yields. So any increase in bond yields will lower the gratuity liability and vice versa, but, it will also lower the asset values.

# Inflation Risk

The salary inflation is the major risk that the gratuity fund liability carries. In a general economic sense and in a longer view, there is a case that if bond yields increase, the change in salary inflation generally offsets the gains from the decrease in discounted gratuity liability. But viewed with the fact that asset values will also decrease, the salary inflation does, as an overall affect, increases the net liability of the Bank.

# Life Expectancy / Withdrawal Rate

The gratuity is paid off at the maximum of age 60. The life expectancy is in almost minimal range and is quite predictable in the ages when the employee is in the accredited employment of the Bank for the purpose of the gratuity. Thus, the risk of life expectancy is almost negligible. However, had a post retirement benefit been given by the Bank like monthly pension, post retirement medical etc., this would have been a significant risk which would have been quite difficult to value even by using advance mortality improvement models.

The withdrawal risk is dependent upon the benefit structure, age and retention profile of the staff, the valuation methodology, and long-term valuation assumptions.

# Other Risks

Though, not imminent and observable, over long term there are some risks that may crystallize. This includes:

# Model Risk

The defined benefit gratuity liability is usually actuarially valued each year. Further, the assets in the gratuity fund are also marked to market. This two-tier valuation gives rise to the model risk.

# Retention Risk

The risk that employee will not be motivated to continue the service or start working with the Bank if no market comparable retirement benefit is provided.

# Final Salary Risk

The risk, for defined benefit gratuity, that any disproportionate salary merit increases in later service years will give rise to multiplicative increase in the gratuity liability as such increase is applicable to all the past years of service.

# Operational Risk related to a Separate Entity

Retirement benefits are funded through a separate trust fund which is a different legal entity than the Bank. Generally, the protocols, processes and conventions used throughout the Bank are not applicable or are not actively applied to the retirement benefit funds. This gives rise to some specific operational risks.

# Compliance Risk

The risk that retirement benefits offered by the Bank does not comply with minimum statutory requirements.

# Legal / Political Risk

The risk that the legal / political environment changes and the Bank is required to offer additional or different retirement benefits than what the Bank projected.

# DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

The general description of the plan is included in note 4.11.

# Contributions made during the year :

| |(Rupees in '000)|

# 41. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction.

# 41.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the year.

# 46. RISK MANAGEMENT

The Bank has a risk management framework commensurate with its size and the nature of its business. The Board of Directors has approved risk management policies covering key areas of activities for the guidance of management and committees of the Board, management committees, and Divisions / Departments of the Bank. This section presents information about the Bank’s exposure to and its management and control of risks, in particular the primary risks associated with its use of financial instruments.

# 46.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from failure by a client or counterparty to meet its contractual obligation. It emanates from loans and advances, commitments to lend, contingent liabilities such as letters of credit and guarantees, and other similar transactions both on and off balance sheet. The objective of credit risk management is to keep credit risk exposure within permissible level, relevant to the Bank’s risk capital, to maintain the soundness of assets and to ensure returns commensurate with risk.

Credit risk of the Bank is managed through the credit policy approved by the Board, a well-defined credit approval mechanism, prescribed documentation requirement, post disbursement administration, review and monitoring of all credit facilities, and continuous assessment of credit worthiness of counterparties. Decisions regarding the credit portfolio are taken mainly by the Central Credit Committee. Credit Risk Management Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Bank's credit risk. Counterparty exposure limits are approved in line with the Prudential Regulations and the Bank's own Policies by taking into account both qualitative and quantitative criteria. There is an established system for continuous monitoring of credit exposures and follow-up of any past due loans with the respective business units. All past due loans, including trade bills, are reviewed on fortnightly basis and pursued for recovery. Any non-performing loans are classified and provided for as per Prudential Regulations.

The Bank has also established a mechanism for independent post-disbursement review of large credit risk exposures. Credit facilities, both fund based and non-fund based, extended to large customer groups and industrial sectors are regularly monitored. The Bank has concentration of credit in textiles which is the largest sector of Pakistan's economy. Concentration risk is managed by diversification within sub-sectors like spinning, weaving and composites etc.

Credit Administration Department (CAD) is primarily responsible for custody, monitoring, and maintenance of security that underlies the banks’ credit portfolio. CAD is also responsible for ensuring that all required terms and conditions as per approvals are properly reflected in customer documentation.

The Bank has implemented its own internal risk rating system for the credit portfolio, as per guidelines of SBP. Credit ratings by external rating agencies, if available, are also considered.

Generally, the Bank primarily lends against cash flows, which is considered the primary source of repayment. However, if cash flows of a borrower deteriorate and are insufficient to service debt obligations, collateral serves as the secondary recourse of repayment.

Provisions for the credit portfolio are determined in accordance with IFRS 9 and SBP Prudential Regulations. Details of credit loss allowance against advances are provided in note 9.6.

The Bank uses the Standardised Approach to calculate capital charge for credit risk as per Basel regulatory framework, with comprehensive approach for credit risk mitigation. Stress testing for credit risk is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of increase in non–performing loans and downward shift in these categories.

# 46.1.7 Forward-looking information contained in ECL

The assessment of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculation incorporates forward looking information. Forward-looking aspect introduces an extra dimension, which is often captured by relating expected losses to the macro-economic variables. The incorporation of macroeconomic factors increases the accuracy of the results produced and makes it more reliable to predict/ estimate future results more accurately.

The Bank uses historic and forecasted data to determine the impact of macroeconomic factors to estimate Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) etc. Further, statistical models based on historical correlation is performed to identify most significant macro-economic variable(s) that have been recognized as contributors to the default/performance of any portfolio. The macro-economic variables (including GDP, Unemployment, Import, Export, Exchange rate and CPI) used in the ECL calculation are fetched from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) database and the relevant macro-economic variables are selected based on sensitivity of each of the portfolios to specific macro-economic variables. Three macro-economic scenarios have been developed base, improved, and worst with assigned scenario probability weightings of 80%, 10%, and 10% respectively.

The Bank conducted a sensitivity analysis on macro-economic indicators which are utilized for forward-looking calculations. As of December 31, 2024, when the macro-economic indicators in the neutral scenario was adjusted upwards or downwards by 10%, the ECL showed the following variation:

# 46.1.8 Sensitivity of ECL to Future Economic Conditions

The ECL are sensitive to judgements and assumption made regarding formulation of forward-looking scenarios and how much such scenarios are incorporated into calculations. The Bank performs sensitivity analysis on the ECL recognized on each of its segments. The table below shows the loss allowance on each segment assuming each forward-looking scenario (e.g. Central, upside and downside) were weighted 100 percent instead of applying scenario probability across the three scenarios.

# 46.2 Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. The Bank takes positions in securities for the purpose of investment and not to run a trading book, except to a very limited extent (maximum of Rs. 300 million) for trading in equities. As regards foreign exchange positions, the purpose is to serve the needs of clients. Except as aforesaid, the Bank does not engage in trading or market making activities.

Market risk is managed through the Market Risk Policy and Treasury and Investment Policy approved by the Board, approval of counterparty and dealer limits, specific senior management approval for each investment and regular review and monitoring of the investment portfolio by the Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO). A key element of the Bank’s market risk management is to balance safety, liquidity, and income in that order of priority. Another key element is separation of functions and reporting lines for the Treasury Division and Equity Market Department, which undertake dealing activities within the limits and parameters set by ALCO, Settlements Department which confirms and settles the aforesaid deals, and Middle Office which independently monitors and analyses the risks inherent in treasury operations. Risk Management Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Bank’s market risk.

Dealing activities of the Bank include investment in government securities, term finance certificates, sukuks / bonds, shares and mutual funds, money market transactions and foreign exchange transactions catering to the needs of its customers. All such activities are carried out within the prescribed limits. Any excess over limits noted by the Settlements Department and / or the Middle Office is reported to senior management and ALCO. Stress testing is performed as per guidelines of SBP as well as Bank's internal policy. Portfolio risks arising in banking book are also measured through Value at Risk (VAR).

# 46.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in currency exchange rates. The Bank’s foreign exchange exposure comprises forward contracts, purchase of foreign bills, foreign currency loans and investments, foreign currency cash in hand, balances with banks abroad, foreign currency deposits and foreign currency placements with SBP and other banks. Focus of the Bank’s foreign exchange activities is on catering to the needs of its customers, both in spot and forward markets. Foreign exchange risk exposures of the Bank are controlled through dealer limits, open foreign exchange position limits, counterparty exposure limits, and country limits. The Bank manages its foreign exchange exposure by matching foreign currency assets and liabilities within strict limits. The net open position in any single currency and the overall foreign exchange exposure are both managed within the statutory limits as prescribed by SBP as well as the internal limits set by the Bank itself. Stress testing for foreign exchange risk is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of adverse changes in foreign exchange rates.

# 46.2.3 Equity Position Risk

Equity position risk is the risk of loss from adverse movements in equity prices. The Bank’s policy is to take equity positions for investment purposes and not to run a trading book, except to a very limited extent (maximum of Rs. 300 million) for trading in equities.

Equity position risk of the Bank is controlled through equity portfolio limits, sector limits, scrip limits, and future contracts limits. Direct investment in equities and mutual funds is managed within the statutory limits as prescribed by SBP as well as the internal limits set by the Bank itself. Stress testing for equity price risk is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of decline in stock prices. The Bank invests mainly in blue chip securities.

# 46.2.4 Yield / Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) - Basel II Specific

Interest rate risk is the risk of loss from adverse movements in interest rates. ALCO monitors and manages the interest rate risk with the objective of limiting the potential adverse effects on the profitability of the Bank arising from fluctuation in the market interest rates and mismatching or gaps in the amount of financial assets and financial liabilities in different maturity time bands.

The Bank's interest rate exposure is calculated by categorising its interest sensitive assets and liabilities into various time bands based on the earlier of their contractual repricing or maturity dates.

Interest rate risk exposures of the Bank are controlled through dealer limits, counterparty exposure limits and (when necessary) type-of-instrument limits. Outright purchase and sale of securities are also approved by ALCO. Duration and modified duration of various types of debt securities as well as their entire portfolio are also calculated, and the impact of adverse change in interest rates on the market value of the securities is estimated. Stress testing for interest rate risk is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of adverse changes in the interest rates.

# Interest rate / yield risk in the banking book – Basel Specific

The Bank holds financial assets and financial liabilities with different maturities or repricing dates and linked to different benchmark rates, thus creating exposure to unexpected changes in the level of interest rates. Interest rate risk in the banking book refers to the risk associated with interest-bearing financial instruments that are not held in the trading book of the Bank.

Repricing gap analysis presents the Bank’s Interest Sensitive Assets (ISA) and Interest Sensitive Liabilities (ISL), categorised into various time bands based on the earlier of their contractual repricing or maturity dates (or settlement dates for off-balance sheet instruments). Deposits with no fixed maturity dates (for example, saving deposits and treasurer’s call deposits) are included in the lowest, one-month time band, but these are not expected to be payable within a one-month period. The difference between ISA and ISL for each time band signifies the gap in that time band, and provides a workable framework for determining the impact on net interest income.

The Bank reviews the repricing gap analysis periodically to monitor and manage interest rate risk in the banking book.

# 46.3 Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. This definition includes legal risk but excludes strategic and reputational risks. Bank classifies operational loss / near miss incidents into seven loss incidents types, which are Internal Fraud, External Fraud, Employment Practice & Workplace Safety, Client, Product & Business Practice, Damage to Physical Assets, Business Disruption & System Failure, and Execution, Delivery & Process Management.

Operational risk is managed through the Operational Risk Policy, Internal Control System and Internal Audit Policy, Compliance Policy & Programme, Information Technology (I.T.) Policy, I.T. Governance and Risk Management Framework, I.T. Security Policy, Human Resource Policy, Consumer Protection Framework, KYC / CDD Policy, AML / CFT and CPF Policy, Fraud Prevention Policy, Digital Fraud Prevention Policy, Service Quality and Consumer Grievance Handling Policy, Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery Policy and Outsourcing Policy approved by the Board, along with the operational manuals and procedures issued from time to time; system of internal controls; Business Continuity Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan for I.T.; and regular audit of the branches and divisions. Operational risk related matters are discussed in the operations committee, compliance committee of management and I.T. steering committee. Audit Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Bank’s operational risk.

The Bank’s operational risk management framework, as laid down in the operational risk policy, permits the overall risk management approach to evolve in the light of organisational learning and the future needs of the Bank.

The Bank places a high priority on conducting all business dealings with integrity and fairness, as laid down in the Code of Conduct, which is required to be complied with by all employees.

Internal controls are an essential feature of risk reduction in operational risk management and the Bank continues to improve its internal controls.

Business Continuity Planning (BCP) of the Bank pays special attention to identify potential threats and associated risks by carrying out Business Impact Analysis and Risk Assessment processes to minimise financial losses, serve customers with minimal disruptions, and mitigate negative effects on business operations, including those that are dependent on third parties. It also identifies alternate mechanisms for timely resumption of services, with a special focus on critical business processes, location of off-site backup and regular review and testing of the BCP plan.

Bank AL Habib’s internet banking platform, both web and mobile based applications offer various digital products and services to the customers and are being regularly enhanced with new features to provide better customer experience and security.

The Bank has zero tolerance for Cybersecurity risks and non-compliance to regulations. Monitoring controls and processes have been implemented to identify and appropriately address Cybersecurity risks. Long term measures are defined in Cyber Security Strategy that is supported by a complementing Action Plan. While Information Security Risk Management plan covers measures for identifying the risks posed to Information Systems in alignment with Bank’s strategy, the Bank has developed a cyber secure environment by implementing various technical and administrative controls to ensure security and privacy of customers’ data residing with the Bank. In this regard, Bank has also implemented industrial standards and best practices for Information Security assurance including payment card security standard (i.e. PCI - DSS v4.0).

# 46.3.1 Operational Risk-Disclosures Basel II Specific

The Bank uses Basic Indicator Approach to calculate capital charge for operational risk as per Basel regulatory framework. This approach is considered to be most suitable in view of the business model of the Bank which relies on an extensive network of branches to offer one - stop, full – service banking to its clients. The Bank has developed and implemented an Operational Loss Database. Operational loss and "near miss" events are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions taken on an ongoing basis, including measures to improve security and control procedures. Key Risk Indicators have also been developed along with thresholds which are being closely monitored for breaches. Risk Evaluation exercise is carried out for new products, processes and systems or any significant change in the existing product, processes and systems as per the operational risk policy of the Bank.

# 46.4 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk of loss to a bank arising from its inability to meet obligations as they fall due or to fund growth in assets, without incurring unacceptable cost or losses.

Key elements of the Bank’s liquidity risk management are as follows:

- To maintain a comfortable margin of excess liquidity in the form of cash and readily marketable assets to meet the Bank’s funding requirements at any time.
- To keep a strong focus on mobilization of low-cost core deposits from customers.
- To maintain a realistic balance between the behavioral maturity profiles of assets and liabilities.
- To maintain excellent credit rating (as borrowing cost and ability to raise funds are directly affected by credit rating).
- To have a written contingency funding plan to address any hypothetical situations when access to normal sources of funding is constrained.

# 46.4.1 Liquidity Coverage Ratio

SBP issued BPRD Circular No. 08 dated June 23, 2016 advising implementation of Basel III liquidity standards that constitute two ratios, i.e., Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), and five monitoring tools.

# 46.4.1 Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)

LCR is the measure of conversion capability of the Bank’s High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) into cash to meet immediate liquidity requirements over a 30 days horizon. The Bank calculates Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) on monthly basis as per the guidelines given in the above mentioned circular. The objective of LCR is to ensure the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile which requires the Bank to maintain sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) to meet stressed cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar days period. As of 31 December 2024, the Bank’s LCR stood at 235.74% against SBP’s minimum requirement of 100%.

# 46.4.2 Governance of Liquidity Risk Management

Liquidity risk is managed through the liquidity risk policy approved by the Board. The Bank has “zero tolerance” for liquidity risk and will continue to maintain a comfortable margin of excess liquidity in the form of cash and readily marketable assets to meet its funding requirements at any time. Management of liquidity risk is accomplished through a formal structure which includes:

- Board of Directors (BOD)
- Risk Management Committee
- Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO)
- Treasury Division
- Risk Management Division and Middle Office
- Finance Division
- Information Technology Division

The Board of Directors approves the liquidity risk policy and ensures, through quarterly reviews by the Risk Management Committee of the Board, that the Bank’s liquidity risk is being managed prudently. Risk Management Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Bank’s liquidity risk. Liquidity position is monitored daily by the Treasury Division and the Middle Office and reviewed regularly by ALCO.

# 46.4.3 Funding Strategy

The Bank’s prime source of liquidity is the customers' deposit base. Within deposits, the Bank strives to maintain core deposit base in form of current and saving deposits and avoids concentration in particular products, tenors and dependence on large fund providers. As a general rule, the Bank will not depend on borrowings in the inter-bank market, including repos, to be a part of its permanent pool of funds for financing of loans, but will use these as a source for obtaining moderate amounts of additional funds to meet temporary liquidity needs in the normal course of business or for money market operations.

# 46.4.4 Liquidity Risk Mitigation Techniques

Various tools and techniques are used to measure and monitor the possible liquidity risk. These include monitoring of different liquidity ratios like core deposits to total deposits, advances to deposits, liquid assets to total deposits, Interbank borrowing to total deposits, which are monitored on regular basis against limits. Further, the Bank also prepares the maturity profile of assets and liabilities to monitor the liquidity gaps over different time bands. For maturity analysis, behavioral study is carried out to determine the behavior of non-contractual assets and liabilities. The Bank also ensures that statutory cash and liquidity requirements are maintained at all times. In addition, LCR, NSFR and Monitoring Tools of Basel III framework further strengthen liquidity risk management of the Bank.

# 46.4.5 Liquidity Stress Testing

As per SBP FSD Circular No. 01 of 2020, Liquidity stress testing is being conducted under various stress scenarios. Shocks include the withdrawals of deposits, withdrawals of wholesale / large deposits & interbank borrowing, withdrawal of top deposits, etc. Results of stress testing are presented to ALCO and Risk Management Committee. The Bank’s liquidity risk management addresses the goal of protecting solvency and the ability to withstand stressful events in the market place. Stress testing for liquidity as prescribed in the liquidity risk policy is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of decline in liquidity on the ratio of liquid assets to deposits plus borrowings.

# 46.4.6 Contingency Funding Plan

Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) is a part of liquidity risk policy of the Bank which identifies the trigger events that could cause a liquidity contingency and describes the actions to be taken to manage it. The contingency funding plan highlights liquidity management actions that needs to be taken to deal with the contingency. Responsibilities and response levels are also incorporated in order to tackle the contingency. Moreover, CFP highlights possible funding sources, in case of a liquidity contingency.

# 46.4.7 Main Components of LCR

Main components of LCR are High Quality Liquid Assets and Net Cash Outflows. Outflows are mainly deposit outflows net of cash inflows which consist of inflows from financing and money market placements up to 1 month. The inputs for calculation of LCR are based on SBP BPRD Circular No. 08 dated 23 June 2016.

# 46.4.8 Composition of High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs)

High Quality Liquid Assets consist of Level 1 Assets which are included in the stock of liquid assets at 100% weightage of their market value i.e., Cash & Treasury balances, Conventional Government Securities, GOP Ijarah Sukuks, Foreign Currency Sukuks & Bonds issued by sovereigns. While Level 2 Assets comprise all equity shares (excluding shares of Financial Institutions) listed on PSX 100.

# 46.4.9 Concentration of Funding Sources

The Bank relies on customers' deposits as its key source of funding, especially current and saving deposits and time deposits of small / medium denominations, and avoids concentration of large deposits. Share of core deposits in total deposits and of large deposits in total deposits are regularly monitored. In particular the Bank does not depend on large depositors or borrowings from SBP and financial institutions to meet its funding requirements.

# 46.4.10 Currency Mismatch in the LCR

About 90% of the Bank's assets and liabilities are in local currency. Currency mismatch in other currencies is regularly monitored.

# 46.4.11 Centralisation of Liquidity Management

Overall liquidity management of the Bank is centralised in Treasury Division at Principal Office. The Bank mobilises deposits through its branch network. It also uses the branch network to grant loans to customers. Branches that have more deposits than loans, transfer (“lend”) their excess deposits to the Principal Office. Branches that do not have enough deposits to fund their loans, acquire (“borrow”) additional funds from the Principal Office.

# 46.4.12 Other Inflows and Outflows

Benefit of pledged deposits (deposits under lien) are not accounted for in calculation of LCR.

# 46.4.13 Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)

NSFR is the ratio of the amount of Available Stable Funding (ASF) - source of funds, capital and liabilities relative to the amount of Required Stable Funding (RSF) - use of funds, assets and off - balance sheet exposures.

The objective of NSFR is to ensure the availability of stable funds that a bank must hold to enable it to build and maintain its assets, investments and off balance sheet portfolio on an ongoing basis for longer term, i.e., over a one year horizon. NSFR reduces maturity mismatches between the asset and liability items on the balance sheet and thereby reduces funding and roll - over risk. The Bank’s NSFR stood at 184.92% as on 31 December 2024.

# 46.5 Maturities of Assets and Liabilities

based on contractual maturity of the assets and liabilities of the Bank

The following maturity profile is based on contractual maturities for assets and liabilities that have a contractual maturity. Assets and liabilities that do not have a contractual maturity have been categorised in the shortest maturity band.

# 46.6 Maturities of assets and liabilities - based on expected maturities of the assets and liabilities of the Bank

For assets and liabilities that have a contractual maturity, the expected maturity is considered to be the same as contractual maturity. Assets and liabilities that do not have a contractual maturity have been categorised on the basis of expected maturities as determined by ALCO. In case of saving and current accounts, their historical net withdrawal pattern over the next one year was reviewed, based on year-end balances for the last three years. Thereafter, taking a conservative view, ALCO categorised these deposits in various maturity bands. Other assets and liabilities have been categorised on the basis of assumptions / judgments that are believed to be reasonable.

# 10.3 Parameters used for allocation of profit, charging expenses and provisions etc. along with a brief description of their major components

The Bank’s Islamic Banking Division (IBD) is accepting Term Deposits and Saving Deposits under Mudaraba arrangements, wherein the Bank is Mudarib and depositors are Rab-Ul-Maal. The Bank with the prior approval of Depositors also commingles its funds with those of depositors.

The funds so generated are invested by the Bank in Shariah compliant modes of financing and investments such as Murabaha, Ijarah, Istisna, Diminishing Musharakah, Running Musharakah, Musawama, Shares, Mutual Funds and Sukuks etc.

The Bank calculates the profit of the pool every month. Profit is distributed at the Net Income level. Net Income is calculated after deducting direct costs such as cost of Murabaha, cost of Takaful, Depreciation on Ijarah Assets, and amortization of premium on sukuks and loss of investments directly incurred in deriving that Income.

The Net income / loss is being allocated between the Bank’s equity and the depositors’ fund in proportion to their respective share in pool.

The Bank’s profit sharing ratio during the quarter was 50% (2023: 50%) of Net Income and the depositors’ profit sharing ratio was 50% (2023: 50%) of Net Income.

After the allocation of Income between mudarib (Bank) and depositors (Rab ul Maal) the profit is distributed among the depositors on the basis of predetermined weightages, announced by the Bank at the beginning of the month based on their respective category / tiers. In case of loss, Rab-ul-Maal has to bear the loss in the ratio of its investment.

In case of provisioning, the general and specific provisions created against non-performing financing, credit loss allowance under IFRS-9 and diminution in the value of investments as under prudential regulations and other SBP directives shall be borne by the IBIs as Mudarib. However, write-offs of financings and loss on sale of investments shall be charged to the pool along with other direct expenses.

# Disclosure on Complaint Handling in Annual Accounts-2024

The Customer Services function takes contentment in serving as custodian of Complaint Management which is primarily in control of upholding high FTC (Fair Treatment to Customers) standards by promptly resolving complaints and providing fair resolutions to customers.

To promote customer centricity in the culture and dynamics of BAHL, we have developed a comprehensive policy for handling customer complaints that is established on the values of fairness, transparency, promptness, visibility, and accessibility. BAHL take complaints as an effective measure to improve its services instead of considering complaints as root cause for customer dissatisfaction. Additionally, Fair Treatment to Consumers Committee (FTCC) is established to anticipate customer problems and recommend resolution that can give our customers a better experience.

Customers can register complaints through a variety of channels, including a call center, the bank’s website, direct emails, social media, and letters delivered directly or through drop box to the customer services division. These complaints are swiftly recorded in the complaint management system. From the time a complaint is acknowledged until it is resolved, bank has a defined escalation matrix to resolve complaints, where if any complaint is not resolved within the allotted turnaround time, it is escalated to the next senior level of management to ensure resolution of the complaints on priority.

As a post resolution activity, the complaint trends and analysis are shared with Board Members, Senior Management and Business Segments. Based on the findings, root cause analysis is conducted and communicated timely with the relevant departments for reduction of customer grievance.

# Key Highlight:

In 2024, the Bank received 337,053 complaints, about 15% higher than the previous year. The complaints were investigated and closed within an average turnaround time of 4 working days.

# Gender Pay Gap as on 31 December 2024

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the members of Bank AL Habib Limited

# Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

# Opinion

We have audited the annexed consolidated financial statements of Bank AL Habib Limited (the Bank) and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2024, and the consolidated statement of profit and loss account, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2024 and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Pakistan. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants as adopted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (the Code) and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to Note 4.26 to the consolidated financial statements which indicates that the comparative information presented as at and for the year ended 31 December 2023 has been restated. Our opinion has not been modified in respect of this matter.

# Key Audit Matter

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# Key Audit Matter

|S.No.|Key Audit Matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|Valuation of Advances: (Refer note 9 & 21 to the Consolidated financial statements) As at 31 December 2024, the Bank’s Credit loss allowance against advances and off-balance sheet items amounted to Rs. 48,462 million and Rs. 4,742 million respectively. As per the BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023, the Bank adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the application instructions as issued by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for IFRS 9 from 01 January 2024 which requires the Bank to recognize Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on advances including non-funded exposure. The estimation of ECL on advances including non-funded exposure, involves judgement and complexity. The key areas which are subject to management judgement in the estimation of ECL are:|- Performing risk assessment procedures over the credit loss allowance against advances and off-balance sheet exposure within the Bank’s consolidated financial statement. As part of these risk assessment procedures, identifying the portfolios associated with a risk of material misstatement including those arising from judgements over the estimation of ECL either due to inputs, methods or assumption.
- Assessing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls established by the Bank over measurement of ECL and provision calculated as per PR;
- We involved in-house specialist who assisted in the following: - Evaluating the Bank’s impairment methodologies for compliance with application instructions as issued by SBP for IFRS 9;
- Assessing the reasonableness of the Bank’s methodology and models for determining the economic scenarios used and the probability weightings applied to them by independently validating and challenging the assumptions, methodologies, and outputs of the models;
- Assessing the reasonableness of macro-economic variable and economic forecasts by comparing these to external sourced data extracted;
- Performing independent testing of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) allowance on a sample basis.
- Ensuring completeness of the key inputs into the ECL calculations with their respective sub-ledgers and general ledgers.
- Performing testing on sample basis over key inputs into the ECL calculations with their respective source documents.
- Performing sensitivity analysis on the key assumption, that is probability weighted economic scenarios, to assess reasonableness and the risk of biasness by changing weights assigned to each economic scenario.
- In accordance with the PR, we sampled at least sixty percent of the total advances portfolio and performed credit review through the following substantive procedures:
|

# Key Audit Matter

|S.No.|Key Audit Matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|Because of the high degree of estimation uncertainty and judgement involved in the calculation of ECL we considered the area of ECL provision as a key audit matter.|- Verifying repayments of advances/mark-up installments and checked that non-performing advances have been correctly classified and categorized based on the number of days overdue;
- Examining watch list accounts and, based on review of the individual facts and circumstances, discussions with management and our assessment of financial conditions of the borrowers, formed a judgement as to whether classification of these accounts as performing was appropriate;
- Assessing the accuracy of specific provision made against non-performing advances in accordance with the criteria prescribed under the PRs by performing recalculation.
|
| | |- Assessing the appropriateness of SICR criteria applied by the Bank by ensuring that the SICR criteria and staging methodology are consistent with the relevant application instructions as issued by SBP for IFRS 9.
- Assessing the appropriateness of ECL on advances categorized as Stage 3 by performing a comparison of ECL computed, through the use of methodology and models with the provision required to be computed as required under the PR to ensure that an amount which is higher of the ECL and PR requirements is appropriately recognized for these stage 3 advances pursuant to the requirement of application instructions as issued by SBP for IFRS 9.
- Evaluating the adequacy of the financial statement disclosures, including disclosures of key assumptions, judgements and sensitivities.

# Information other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The Other Information comprises the Annual Report but does not include the unconsolidated financial statements, consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s reports thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Other Matter relating to comparative information

The consolidated financial statements of the Bank as at and for the year ended 31 December 2023, excluding the adjustments described in Note 4.26 to the consolidated financial statements were audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those consolidated financial statements on 13 February 2024.

As part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2024, we audited the adjustments described in Note 4.26 that were applied to restate the comparative information presented as at and for the year ended 31 December 2023. We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, other than with respect to the adjustments described in Note 4.26 to the consolidated financial statements.

Accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on those respective financial statements taken as a whole. However, in our opinion, the adjustments described in Note 4.26 are appropriate and have been properly applied.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Muhammad Taufiq.

# 2.3

These financial statements are presented in Pak Rupees which is the Group's functional and presentation currency.

# 2.4

The Group believes that there is no significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.

# 2.5 Statement of compliance

# 2.5.1

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards comprise of:

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- IFAS issued by ICAP, as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by SBP and SECP differ with the requirements of the IFRS or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

# 2.5.2

The disclosures made in these consolidated financial statements have been based on a format prescribed by SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 02 dated 09 February 2023 with further addition made vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 13 of 2024, dated 01 July 2024 and accounting and financial reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan.

# 2.5.3

SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment Property' for Banking Companies in Pakistan through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated 26 August 2002 till further instructions. Also, SECP has deferred the applicability of IFRS 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' through its notification S.R.O 411 (I) / 2008 dated 28 April 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.

# 2.5.4

The disclosures requirements of IFAS 3, 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits' for Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) relating to annual and quarterly financial statements have been based on a format prescribed by SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 02 dated 09 February 2023.

# 2.5.5

IFRS 10, 'Consolidated Financial Statements' was made applicable from period beginning on or after 01 January 2015 vide S.R.O 633 (I) / 2014 dated 10 July 2014 by SECP. However, SECP has directed through S.R.O 56 (I) / 2016 dated 28 January 2016 that the requirement of consolidation under section 228 of the Companies Act, 2017 and IFRS 10, 'Consolidated Financial Statements' is not applicable in case of investment by companies in mutual funds established under trust structure.

# 2.5.6

These consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared using generally consistent accounting policies. However, as per SBP IFRS 9 application instructions, overseas branches comply with the local regulations enforced within their respective jurisdictions under IFRS 9.

# 2.5.7

As per BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated 29 July 2024, unlisted equity securities are currently carried at the lower of cost or breakup value as per the exemption granted by SBP. Effective from 01 January 2025, as per the requirement of IFRS 9, these will be measured at fair value under IFRS 13.

# 2.5.8

The Bank received an extension from SBP up to 31 December 2025 for application of EIR in general for all financial assets and liabilities (excluding staff loans / subsidized loans), however as financial assets other than advances and financial liabilities were already effectively carried at EIR before the implementation of IFRS 9 hence said extension has only been applied on advances (excluding staff loans / subsidized loans i.e. Temporary Economic Refinance Facility). Therefore, advances are now carried at cost, excluding staff loans, TERF and advances pertaining to overseas operations, which are carried at amortized cost, net of expected credit loss allowances.

Further, SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 dated 22 January 2025 has clarified the followings:

- Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) are allowed to follow Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) 1 & 2 where applicable and continue the existing accounting methodology on other Islamic products until issuance of further instruction in this regard.
- The treatment of charity should be in line with the existing practices as defined in SBP instructions issued via IBD Circular No. 02 of 2008 and should not be recognized as income.

# 2.5.9

All Islamic products are governed by the product manual approved by the Shariah Board of the Bank. The related accounting and revenue recognition policies are outlined in notes 4.5.3, 4.16.2 and 4.16.3 of these unconsolidated financial statements, respectively. However, in case of Ijarah and Murhaba, the Bank has also complied with the requirements of IFAS 1 and IFAS 2. Other than the products disclosed in the aforementioned notes, all remaining Islamic products are accounted for under IFRS 9.

# 2.5.10

In addition, due to the application of IFRS 9, SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 02 dated 09 February 2023, has also amended the format of the annual financial statements.

Except for the above, there are certain other interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning 01 January 2024. However, these are not considered to be relevant or do not have any significant effect on the Group's operations and therefore have not been detailed in these consolidated financial statements.

# 2.5.12  Critical accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting and reporting standards
as applicable in Pakistan requires the use of certain accounting estimates. It also requires the management
to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Bank's accounting policies. Estimates and judgements
are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience, including expectations of future events
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The areas where various assumptions and estimates are
significant to the Group's financial statements or where judgement was exercised in the application of
accounting policies are as follows:

- Valuation and Impairment of financial instruments Note 4.1.2.10 & 9
- Classification of investment in associates 47.1.7 & 47.1.8
- Valuation and depreciation of property and equipment 4.5
- Valuation and depreciation of right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities 4.7 & 10
- Valuation of non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims 4.8, 11 & 19
- Valuation of defined benefit plans 4.9 & 14
- Valuation of compensated absences 4.12 & 39
- Taxation 4.12 & 21
- Fair value of derivatives 4.18 & 13
- 4.14 & 26

Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the
revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both
current and future periods.

# 3. BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except
for certain investments and derivatives which are carried at fair value. Lands and buildings classified under
property and equipment and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued
amount. Employee benefits and lease liability against right-of-use assets are carried at present value.

# 4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are
consistent with those followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2023, except as disclosed in note 4.1 below.

# 4.1 Changes in accounting policies

# 4.1.1 Revised format of consolidated financial statements

SBP through its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated 09 February 2023, has amended the format of annual financial
statements of banks. All banks are required to prepare their annual financial statements on the revised
format effective from accounting year starting from 01 January 2024. Accordingly, the Bank has prepared
these consolidated financial statements on the new format prescribed by SBP. The adoption of the new
format contains additional disclosures and certain changes in the financial statements’ presentation,
primarily due to the implementation of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan. However, the corresponding figures
continue to be classified and disclosed in accordance with the previous financial accounting and reporting
framework.

Adoption of revised financial statements format has also resulted in following material changes (due to
which the corresponding presentations have also been changed):

- Right-of-use-assets (note 11) amounting to Rs. 13,731.222 million (2023: Rs. 11,969.724 million) which
were previously shown as part of property and equipment are now shown separately on the
consolidated statement of financial position.
- Lease liabilities (note 19) amounting to Rs. 16,897.021 million (2023: Rs. 14,441.482 million) which
were previously shown as part of other liabilities are now shown separately on the consolidated
statement of financial position.

# 4.1.2 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

During the year, as directed by SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated 13 April 2023, IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments' (the Standard) became applicable to the Bank.

BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated 05 July 2022 issued by SBP provides detailed instructions on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks.

The Standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application instructions from 01 January 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognized in retained earnings and reserves as at 01 January 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard. Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9.

SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated 29 July 2024, has amended and extended the timelines for application instructions. Under the revised guidelines, banks are required to implement modification accounting for financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the Standard. These changes took effect from 01 October 2024, and have been applied retrospectively from 01 January 2024. SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 dated 22 January 2025, SBP further clarifies that modification accounting to be applied to loans modified on or after 01 January 2020.

# 4.1.2.1.1

As per paragraph 3.2 of the Application Instructions, Government securities in local currency are exempted from the application of ECL framework, details are mentioned in note 4.1.2.10 to these consolidated financial statements.

# 4.1.2.1.2

Certain debt securities are held by the Bank in separate portfolios to meet everyday liquidity needs. The Bank seeks to minimise the costs of managing these liquidity needs and therefore actively manages the return on the portfolio. That return consists of collecting contractual payments as well as gains and losses from the sale of financial assets. The investment strategy often results in sales activity that is significant in value. The Bank considers that under IFRS 9 these securities are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.

# 4.1.2.1.3

These financial assets are held by overseas branches. As per paragraph 1.2 of the Application Instruction, in relation to overseas branches, IFRS 9 will be applicable based on their respective host country’s regulatory accounting practices. Since IFRS 9 was already applicable to overseas branches as at 01 January 2024, there is no impact of IFRS 9 adoption on these financial assets.

# 4.1.2.1.4

The Bank previously classified certain equity investments as Available-for-Sale (AFS). Upon implementing IFRS 9, the Bank designated these equity investments as strategic and made an irrevocable election to classify them at FVOCI.

# 4.1.2.1.5

This includes puttable instrument that can be put back at any time for cash equal to a proportionate share of the net asset value of an entity. These assets are therefore mandatorily classified at FVPL under IFRS 9.

# 4.1.2.1.6

Certain debt securities are held by the Bank in a separate portfolio for long-term yield. These securities may be sold, but such sales are not expected to be more than infrequent. The Bank considers that these securities are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect the contractual cash flows. These assets are classified as measured at amortised cost under IFRS 9.

# 4.1.2.1.7

This includes expected credit loss against off-balance sheet items.

# 4.1.2.1.8

Securities, which were held by the subsidiary companies of the Holding Company, were already subject to IFRS 9 due to their applicable accounting reporting framework hence there is no impact of adoption of IFRS 9 on securities held by the subsidiary companies.

# 4.1.2.2

Impact on regulatory capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the Banks, which has reduced their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the Application Instructions issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement. The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for Stage 1 and Stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the “transitional adjustment amount”) must be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the “transition period” of five years. Moreover, SBP has allowed to adjust the amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions in Tier 2 Capital that have not been added back to CET 1 and vice versa as per Annexure A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024 dated 29 July 2024. Had IFRS 9 not been applied then CAR would have been higher by 8 bps from 18.25% to 18.33%.

# 4.1.2.3

Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) regardless of the business model in which they are held.

# Recognition and initial measurement

Debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at transaction price. The fair value of a financial asset on initial recognition is generally its transaction price. If the Bank determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss account on an appropriate basis over the life of the asset but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data, or the transaction is closed out. Advances other than staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations are initially measured at transaction price i.e., the amount of loan disbursed at disbursement date. Staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) loans and advances pertaining to overseas operations are recognized at fair value at the time of disbursement. The fair value is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using the prevailing market rates for instruments. The difference between the disbursed amount and the fair value at initial recognition is recorded as a prepayment.

# Classification

# Financial assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset other than advances except for staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations is classified as measured at: amortised cost, FVOCI or FVPL.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment by investment basis.

Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in scope of the standard are never bifurcated. Instead, the whole hybrid instrument is assessed for classification.

Advances are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, except for Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and staff loans and advances pertaining to overseas operations, which are measured at amortized cost.

# Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit and loss account (FVPL), when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortized cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortized cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method. Markup expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# 4.1.2.4 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either Held to collect, Held to collect and sale and Others based on Business model assessment. The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The assessment requires judgement based on facts and circumstances on the date of assessment. The assessment considers the policies and objectives for the portfolio of financial assets, risk affecting, performance evaluation, business manager’s compensation and historical sales information.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

# 4.1.2.5 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as interest margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Bank considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Bank considers:

- contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
- leverage features;
- prepayment and extension terms;
- terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and
- features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).

A prepayment feature aligns with SPPI if it mainly represents unpaid principal and profit, including reasonable compensation for early termination.

The Bank holds a portfolio of long-term fixed-rate loans for which the Bank has the option to propose to revise the interest rate at periodic reset dates. These reset rights are limited to the market rate at the time of revision. The borrowers have an option to either accept the revised rate or redeem the loan at par without penalty. The Bank has determined that the contractual cash flows of these loan are SPPI because the option varies the interest rate in a way that is consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and costs associated with the principal amount outstanding.

# 4.1.2.6 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

|Financial assets|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any markup or dividend income, are recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account.|
|---|---|
|Financial assets at amortised cost|These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method in case of investments, lendings to financial institutions, cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks, Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), staff loans, and advances pertaining to overseas operations and other financial assets. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Markup, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account.|


# Debt investments

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and is assessed for impairment under the new ECL model. Markup income is calculated using the effective interest method and includes amortisation of premiums and accretion of discount, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit and loss account. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to consolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# Equity investments

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in consolidated statement of profit and loss account unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are adjusted from the carrying value of investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit and loss account.

# Advances at cost

Advances are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, excluding staff loans, Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations, which are measured at amortized cost, net of expected credit loss allowances.

# 4.1.2.7 Amortised cost and gross carrying amount

The amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount for investments and lendings to financial institution. For financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance or impairment allowance before 01 January 2024.

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

# 4.1.2.8 Calculation of markup income and expense

Income from performing advances of the domestic operations is recognised on accrual basis as per the terms of the contract. However, where debt securities, classified as investments in the financial statements, are purchased at premium or discount, such premium/discount including the transaction cost is amortized through the consolidated statement of profit and loss account over the remaining maturity of the debt security using the effective interest rate method. The interest income on staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations is recognized in line with the EIR, while any expected credit losses are assessed and accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. Income from advances except for staff loans and TERF are recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss account using contractual rate. Similarly, under the local regulatory requirement, income recoverable on classified domestic advances and investments (debt securities), is recognized on a receipt basis.

Income on rescheduled/restructured advances and investments is recognized as permitted by SBP regulations.

In case of overseas operations, income on the financial assets is recognised under the effective interest method or as prescribed by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which the Bank operates.

Markup expense on domestic financial liabilities (comprising deposits, subordinated debts, and borrowings) is recognized on an accrual basis in the period in which it is incurred, based on effective interest rate method. In case of overseas operations, such expense is recognised under the effective interest method or as prescribed by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which the Bank operates.

# 4.1.2.9 Derecognition

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:
- i) substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred; or
- ii) the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognized), and the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in OCI is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account, except that in case of the derecognition of equity securities held at FVOCI, cumulative gains or losses are transferred to unappropriated profit.

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

# 4.1.2.10 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortized cost, and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), advances at cost and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’).

# Measurement of ECL

ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:

- financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive);
- financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows;
- undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive; and
- financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Bank expects to recover.

# Non-Performing financial assets

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost, at cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit‑impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘non-performing’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- the restructuring of a loan by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.

Under SBP's IFRS 9 Application instructions, the Bank is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. The Bank is required to calculate ECL on its non-performing financial assets as higher of provision under Prudential Regulations (PR) and ECL under IFRS 9. Further, the Banks are advised to recognize income on impaired assets (loans classified under PRs i.e., OAEM and Stage 3 loans) on a receipt basis in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations issued by SBP.

The Bank calculates the ECL against corporate, commercial & SME loan portfolios as higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at borrower/facility level, whereas against the retail borrowers the Bank calculates the ECL at higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at segment/product basis as instructed under Annexure A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024 dated 29 July 2024.

Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 Application Instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12-month ECL, Stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2). PD is estimated using internal rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk rating. The Bank has used Transition Matrix approach for estimation of PD for each internal rating. The Bank has used roll-rate method using the days past due (DPD) criteria to estimate PD for its retail portfolio. PD are then adjusted with forward looking information for calculation of ECL.
- EAD: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant. The Bank estimates EAD for financial assets carried at an amortised cost and carried at cost equal to principal plus profit. Each repayment date is assumed to be default point in the model and the ECL is calculated on EAD at each reporting date and discounted at the effective interest rate or contractual interest rate for advances other than staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations for which effective interest rate is used. Further, cash and cash equivalent collaterals that the Bank holds against the non-retail facilities are adjusted from the LGD.
- LGD: An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

Presentation of allowance for Expected Credit Loss in the Statement of Financial Position

Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position as follows:

- Financial assets measured at amortized cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets.
- For advances measured at cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the advances.
- Loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: as a provision in other liabilities.

- where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Bank does not identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component and instead presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision; and

- debt instruments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance is recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance is disclosed and is recognized in OCI.

# 4.1.2.11 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or markup payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PR issued by SBP. Financial assets in Stage 2 may be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum period of 6 months from initial downgrade is required before any facility is moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to move back from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it should meet the criteria defined under the respective Prudential Regulations for de-classification of account / facility. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022. However, banks are free to choose more stringent days past due criteria. Bank align its policy with Annexure-C of BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022; hence, SICR is considered if credit exposure exceeds 60 days past due.

Financial guarantees’ are contracts that require the Bank to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. ‘Loan commitments’ are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions.

When estimating lifetime ECL for undrawn loan commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the loans are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

# 4.1.2.13 Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank enters into transactions of lendings and borrowings at contracted rates for a specified period of time. These are recorded as under:

# 4.4.1 Sale under repurchase obligation

Securities sold with a simultaneous commitment to repurchase at a specified future date (repos) continue to be recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position and are measured in accordance with accounting policies for investments. Amounts received under these agreements are recorded as repurchase agreement borrowings. The difference between sale and repurchase price is amortised as expense over the term of the repo agreement. These are initially recognised at amount of funds received and subsequently reported as payable under the contractual terms.

# 4.4.2 Purchase under resale obligation

Securities purchased with a corresponding commitment to resale at a specified future date (reverse repos) are not recognised as investments in the consolidated statement of financial position. Amounts paid under these arrangements are included in repurchase agreement lendings. The difference between purchase and resale price is accrued as income over the term of the reverse repo agreement. These are initially recognised at amount of funds disbursed and subsequently reported as receivable under the contractual terms.

# 4.4.3 Other borrowings

Other borrowings include borrowings from the State Bank of Pakistan and unsecured call borrowings which are recorded at the amount equivalent to proceeds received.

# 4.5 Investment in associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. Associates are accounted for using equity method in these consolidated financial statements.

As stipulated under Regulation 38 of Non-Banking Finance Regulation, 2008, the Asset Management Company (AMC) is entrusted with fiduciary duties towards the unit holders of the funds. This fiduciary obligation requires AMC to act in the best interests of its unit holders, refraining from exploiting opportunities for its own benefit or that of its related parties, group companies, or employees, to the detriment of the unit holders.

In some cases, the holding of these investments is exceeding 50%. However due to the exemption provided through SRO 56(i) of 2016, for the purpose of determining subsidiary relation, the definition provided under Companies Act, 2017 is not considered rather the definition under IFRS 10 is used. As per IFRS 10, these are not considered subsidiary due to the legal trust structure of the entity the Group does not have the ability to affect returns through its power over the investee. Further, under this trust structure, the trusteeship is separate from the management, and the independent trustees play a key role in overseeing the activities of the AMC.

The Group has significant influence over mutual funds where it has holding percentage of more than 50% and less than 20% due to power to participate in the investee's policy-making processes via the AHMAL and investment in such mutual funds is considered as investment in associates.

After the commencement date, the Bank reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control that affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. The Bank cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate to measure lease liabilities. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The lease liability is also remeasured to reflect any reassessment or lease modification. The interest expense is recorded in consolidated statement of profit and loss account using effective interest rate method.

# 4.9 Non - banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are initially measured at settlement amount and upon revaluation, are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed annually and adjusted, if appropriate. As per SBP's requirement desktop valuation is carried out on annual basis and full-scope valuation after every three years by independent professionally qualified valuers to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. A surplus arising on revaluation of assets is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims' account and any deficit arising on revaluation is taken to consolidated statement of profit and loss account directly.

# 4.26 Prior Period adjustments

# 4.26.1

During the year, the Bank reassessed its treatment of Deferred Tax Liability (DTL) on the revaluation surplus of land based on a legal opinion. It was determined that revaluation surplus for lands acquired during tax years 2016 to 2019 and from tax year 2023 onward are taxable, and corresponding DTL should be recognized. For other tax years, revaluation surplus are not taxable under applicable tax laws in Pakistan. As a consequence, the DTL was overstated and the corresponding surplus was understated by Rs. 4,635 million. During the year, the Bank reversed DTL previously recognized for non-taxable periods and restated prior period figures in accordance with IAS 8 "Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors". As a result of above, Rs. 3,490 million is now reversed from ‘Deferred tax liability’ with corresponding increase in 'Surplus on revaluation of assets' as at 31 December 2023. Further, this adjustment has resulted in increase in the balance of ‘Deferred tax asset’ at 01 January 2023 by Rs. 1,145 million (net of tax) with corresponding increase in the balance of ‘Surplus on revaluation of assets’ by the same amount. Refer note 4.26.3 for the adjustments and their related impacts.

# 4.26.2

Previously, the Bank had recorded DTL on the taxable temporary difference arising on revaluation surplus of building at the rate enacted on each revaluation date. As a consequence, the deferred tax liability was understated and the corresponding surplus was overstated by Rs. 1,583 million. The management has changed its accounting treatment by calculating DTL on the revaluation surplus of building at the rate enacted at each reporting date. As a result of above, Rs. 1,583 million has now been recognized in ‘Deferred tax liability’ with corresponding decrease in 'Surplus on revaluation of assets' as at 31 December 2023. This change has been applied retrospectively in accordance with the requirement of IAS 8 as disclosed in Note 4.26.3 of these consolidated financial statements. In line with IAS 1, the third statement of consolidated statement of financial position is not presented as the impact of these matters in the earliest period presented are not material.

# DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN

# General description

The Bank operates an approved gratuity fund for all its confirmed employees, which is administered by the Trustees. The benefits under the gratuity scheme are payable on retirement at the age of 60 years or on earlier cessation of service as under:

|Number of years of eligible service completed:|Amount of gratuity payable:|
|---|---|
|Less than 5 years|Nil|
|5 years or more but less than 10 years|1/3rd of basic salary for each year served|
|10 years or more but less than 15 years|2/3rd of basic salary for each year served|
|15 years or more|Full basic salary for each year served|

The Bank's costs and contributions are determined based on actuarial valuation carried out at each year end using Projected Unit Credit Actuarial Method. All actuarial gains / losses are recognised in 'other comprehensive income' as they occur and are not reclassified to consolidated statement of profit and loss account in subsequent periods.

# 39.2 Number of employees under the scheme

The number of employees covered under the defined benefit scheme are 17,377 (2023: 16,793).

# 39.3 Principal actuarial assumptions

The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out on 31 December 2024 and the significant assumptions used for actuarial valuation were as follows:

| |2024|2023|
|---|---|---|
|Discount rate|12.25%|15.50%|
|Expected rate of return on plan assets|12.25%|15.50%|

# 39.14 Funding Policy

The Bank will fund the yearly contribution to the defined benefit plan each year, as per the amount calculated by the valuer.

# 39.15 Significant Risk

# Asset Volatility

The Defined Benefit Gratuity Fund is almost entirely invested in Government Bonds with mostly floating income bonds. Almost 87.31% of the total investments (Rs. 7.545 billion) is invested in PIBs. This gives rise to significant reinvestment risk.

The asset class is volatile with reference to the yield on PIBs. This risk should be viewed together with change in the bond yield risk.

# Changes in Bond Yields

There are two dimensions to the changes in bond yields: first, as described above; second, the valuation of the gratuity liability is discounted with reference to these bond yields. So any increase in bond yields will lower the gratuity liability and vice versa, but, it will also lower the asset values.

# Inflation Risk

The salary inflation is the major risk that the gratuity fund liability carries. In a general economic sense and in a longer view, there is a case that if bond yields increase, the change in salary inflation generally offsets the gains from the decrease in discounted gratuity liability. But viewed with the fact that asset values will also decrease, the salary inflation does, as an overall effect, increases the net liability of the Bank.

# Life Expectancy / Withdrawal Rate

The gratuity is paid off at the maximum of age 60. The life expectancy is in almost minimal range and is quite predictable in the ages when the employee is in the accredited employment of the Bank for the purpose of the gratuity. Thus, the risk of life expectancy is almost negligible. However, had a post retirement benefit been given by the Bank like monthly pension, post retirement medical etc., this would have been a significant risk which would have been quite difficult to value even by using advance mortality improvement models.

The withdrawal risk is dependent upon the benefit structure, age and retention profile of the staff, the valuation methodology, and long-term valuation assumptions.

# Other Risks

Though, not imminent and observable, over long term there are some risks that may crystallize. This includes:

# Model Risk

The defined benefit gratuity liability is usually actuarially valued each year. Further, the assets in the gratuity fund are also marked to market. This two-tier valuation gives rise to the model risk.

# Retention Risk

The risk that employee will not be motivated to continue the service or start working with the Bank if no market comparable retirement benefit is provided.

# Final Salary Risk

The risk, for defined benefit gratuity, that any disproportionate salary merit increases in later service years will give rise to multiplicative increase in the gratuity liability as such increase is applicable to all the past years of service.

# Operational Risk related to a Separate Entity

Retirement benefits are funded through a separate trust fund which is a different legal entity than the Bank. Generally, the protocols, processes and conventions used throughout the Bank are not applicable or are not actively applied to the retirement benefit funds. This gives rise to some specific operational risks.

# Compliance Risk

The risk that retirement benefits offered by the Bank does not comply with minimum statutory requirements.

# Legal / Political Risk

The risk that the legal / political environment changes and the Bank is required to offer additional or different retirement benefits than what the Bank projected.

# DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

The general description of the plan is included in note 4.12.

# Contributions made during the year :

|(Rupees in '000)|Employer’s contribution|Employees’ contribution|

# 42. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction.

# 42.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the year.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 47. RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group has a risk management framework commensurate with its size and the nature of its business. The Board of Directors has approved risk management policies covering key areas of activities for the guidance of management and committees of the Board, management committees, and Divisions / Departments of the Group. This section presents information about the Group’s exposure to and its management and control of risks, in particular the primary risks associated with its use of financial instruments.

# 47.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from failure by a client or counterparty to meet its contractual obligation. It emanates from loans and advances, commitments to lend, contingent liabilities such as letters of credit and guarantees, and other similar transactions both on and off balance sheet.

The objective of credit risk management is to keep credit risk exposure within permissible level, relevant to the Group’s risk capital, to maintain the soundness of assets and to ensure returns commensurate with risk.

Credit risk of the Bank is managed through the credit policy approved by the Board, a well-defined credit approval mechanism, prescribed documentation requirement, post disbursement administration, review and monitoring of all credit facilities, and continuous assessment of credit worthiness of counterparties. Decisions regarding the credit portfolio are taken mainly by the Central Credit Committee. Credit Risk Management Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Group's credit risk.

Counterparty exposure limits are approved in line with the Prudential Regulations and the Group's own Policies by taking into account both qualitative and quantitative criteria. There is an established system for continuous monitoring of credit exposures and follow-up of any past due loans with the respective business units. All past due loans, including trade bills, are reviewed on fortnightly basis and pursued for recovery. Any non-performing loans are classified and provided for as per Prudential Regulations.

The Group has also established a mechanism for independent post-disbursement review of large credit risk exposures. Credit facilities, both fund based and non-fund based, extended to large customer groups and industrial sectors are regularly monitored. The Group has concentration of credit in textiles which is the largest sector of Pakistan's economy. Concentration risk is managed by diversification within sub-sectors like spinning, weaving and composites etc.

# Credit Administration Department (CAD)

Credit Administration Department (CAD) is primarily responsible for custody, monitoring, and maintenance of security that underlies the groups’ credit portfolio. CAD is also responsible for ensuring that all required terms and conditions as per approvals are properly reflected in customer documentation.

The Group has implemented its own internal risk rating system for the credit portfolio, as per guidelines of SBP. Credit ratings by external rating agencies, if available, are also considered.

Generally, the Group primarily lends against cash flows, which is considered the primary source of repayment. However, if cash flows of a borrower deteriorate and are insufficient to service debt obligations, collateral serves as the secondary recourse of repayment.

Provisions for the credit portfolio are determined in accordance with IFRS 9 and SBP Prudential Regulations. Details of credit loss allowance against advances are provided in note 9.6.

The Group uses the Standardised Approach to calculate capital charge for credit risk as per Basel regulatory framework, with comprehensive approach for credit risk mitigation.

Stress testing for credit risk is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of increase in non–performing loans and downward shift in these categories.

# 47.1.7 Forward-looking information contained in ECL

The assessment of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculation incorporates forward looking information. Forward-looking aspect introduces an extra dimension, which is often captured by relating expected losses to the macro-economic variables. The incorporation of macroeconomic factors increases the accuracy of the results produced and makes it more reliable to predict/ estimate future results more accurately.

The Group uses historic and forecasted data to determine the impact of macroeconomic factors to estimate Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) etc. Further, statistical models based on historical correlation is performed to identify most significant macro-economic variable(s) that have been recognized as contributors to the default/performance of any portfolio. The macro-economic variables (including GDP, Unemployment, Import, Export, Exchange rate and CPI) used in the ECL calculation are fetched from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) database and the relevant macro-economic variables are selected based on sensitivity of each of the portfolios to specific macro-economic variables. Three macro-economic scenarios have been developed base, improved, and worst with assigned scenario probability weightings of 80%, 10%, and 10% respectively.

The Group conducted a sensitivity analysis on macro-economic indicators which are utilized for forward-looking calculations. As of December 31, 2024, when the macro-economic indicators in the neutral scenario was adjusted upwards or downwards by 10%, the ECL showed the following variation:

# 47.1.8 Sensitivity of ECL to Future Economic Conditions

The ECL are sensitive to judgements and assumption made regarding formulation of forward-looking scenarios and how much such scenarios are incorporated into calculations. The Group performs sensitivity analysis on the ECL recognized on each of its segments. The table below shows the loss allowance on each segment assuming each forward-looking scenario (e.g. Central, upside and downside) were weighted 100 percent instead of applying scenario probability across the three scenarios.

# 47.2 MARKET RISK

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. The Group takes positions in securities for the purpose of investment and not to run a trading book, except to a very limited extent (maximum of Rs. 300 million) for trading in equities. As regards foreign exchange positions, the purpose is to serve the needs of clients. Except as aforesaid, the Group does not engage in trading or market making activities.

Market risk is managed through the Market Risk Policy and Treasury and Investment Policy approved by the Board, approval of counterparty and dealer limits, specific senior management approval for each investment and regular review and monitoring of the investment portfolio by the Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO). A key element of the Group’s market risk management is to balance safety, liquidity, and income in that order of priority. Another key element is separation of functions and reporting lines for the Treasury Division and Equity Market Department, which undertake dealing activities within the limits and parameters set by ALCO, Settlements Department which confirms and settles the aforesaid deals, and Middle Office which independently monitors and analyses the risks inherent in treasury operations. Risk Management Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Group’s market risk.

Dealing activities of the Group include investment in government securities, term finance certificates, sukuks / bonds, shares and mutual funds, money market transactions and foreign exchange transactions catering to the needs of its customers. All such activities are carried out within the prescribed limits. Any excess over limits noted by the Settlements Department and / or the Middle Office is reported to senior management and ALCO. Stress testing is performed as per guidelines of SBP as well as Group's internal policy. Portfolio risks arising in banking book are also measured through Value at Risk (VAR).

# 47.2.4 Yield / Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) - Basel II Specific

Interest rate risk is the risk of loss from adverse movements in interest rates. ALCO monitors and manages the interest rate risk with the objective of limiting the potential adverse effects on the profitability of the Group arising from fluctuation in the market interest rates and mismatching or gaps in the amount of financial assets and financial liabilities in different maturity time bands.

The Group's interest rate exposure is calculated by categorising its interest sensitive assets and liabilities into various time bands based on the earlier of their contractual repricing or maturity dates. Interest rate risk exposures of the Group are controlled through dealer limits, counterparty exposure limits and (when necessary) type-of-instrument limits. Outright purchase and sale of securities are also approved by ALCO. Duration and modified duration of various types of debt securities as well as their entire portfolio are also calculated, and the impact of adverse change in interest rates on the market value of the securities is estimated. Stress testing for interest rate risk is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of adverse changes in the interest rates.

# Interest rate / yield risk in the banking book – Basel Specific

The Group holds financial assets and financial liabilities with different maturities or repricing dates and linked to different benchmark rates, thus creating exposure to unexpected changes in the level of interest rates. Interest rate risk in the banking book refers to the risk associated with interest-bearing financial instruments that are not held in the trading book of the Group.

Repricing gap analysis presents the Group’s Interest Sensitive Assets (ISA) and Interest Sensitive Liabilities (ISL), categorised into various time bands based on the earlier of their contractual repricing or maturity dates (or settlement dates for off-balance sheet instruments). Deposits with no fixed maturity dates (for example, saving deposits and treasurer’s call deposits) are included in the lowest, one-month time band, but these are not expected to be payable within a one-month period. The difference between ISA and ISL for each time band signifies the gap in that time band, and provides a workable framework for determining the impact on net interest income.

The Group reviews the repricing gap analysis periodically to monitor and manage interest rate risk in the banking book.

# 47.3 Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. This definition includes legal risk but excludes strategic and reputational risks. Group classifies operational loss / near miss incidents into seven loss incidents types, which are Internal Fraud, External Fraud, Employment Practice & Workplace Safety, Client, Product & Business Practice, Damage to Physical Assets, Business Disruption & System Failure, and Execution, Delivery & Process Management.

Operational risk is managed through the Operational Risk Policy, Internal Control System and Internal Audit Policy, Compliance Policy & Programme, Information Technology (I.T.) Policy, I.T. Governance and Risk Management Framework, I.T. Security Policy, Human Resource Policy, Consumer Protection Framework, KYC / CDD Policy, AML / CFT and CPF Policy, Fraud Prevention Policy, Service Quality and Consumer Grievance Handling Policy, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Policy and Outsourcing Policy approved by the Board, along with the operational manuals and procedures issued from time to time; system of internal controls; Business Continuity Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan for I.T.; and regular audit of the branches and divisions. Operational risk related matters are discussed in the operations committee, compliance committee of management and I.T. steering committee. Audit Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Group’s operational risk.

The Group’s operational risk management framework, as laid down in the operational risk policy, permits the overall risk management approach to evolve in the light of organisational learning and the future needs of the Group.

The Group places a high priority on conducting all business dealings with integrity and fairness, as laid down in the Code of Conduct, which is required to be complied with by all employees.

Internal controls are an essential feature of risk reduction in operational risk management and the Group continues to improve its internal controls.

Business Continuity Planning (BCP) of the Group pays special attention to identify potential threats and associated risks by carrying out Business Impact Analysis and Risk Assessment processes to minimise financial losses, serve customers with minimal disruptions, and mitigate negative effects on business operations, including those that are dependent on third parties. It also identifies alternate mechanisms for timely resumption of services, with a special focus on critical business processes, location of off-site backup and regular review and testing of the BCP plan.

Bank AL Habib’s internet banking platform, both web and mobile based applications offer various digital products and services to the customers and are being regularly enhanced with new features to provide better customer experience and security.

The Group has zero tolerance for Cybersecurity risks and non-compliance to regulations. Monitoring controls and processes have been implemented to identify and appropriately address Cybersecurity risks. Long term measures are defined in Cyber Security Strategy that is supported by a complementing Action Plan. While Information Security Risk Management plan covers measures for identifying the risks posed to Information Systems in alignment with Group’s strategy, the Group has developed a cyber secure environment by implementing various technical and administrative controls to ensure security and privacy of customers’ data residing with the Group. In this regard, Group has also implemented industrial standards and best practices for Information Security assurance.

# 47.3.1 Operational Risk-Disclosures Basel II Specific

The Group uses Basic Indicator Approach to calculate capital charge for operational risk as per Basel regulatory framework. This approach is considered to be most suitable in view of the business model of the Group which relies on an extensive network of branches to offer one-stop, full-service banking to its clients. The Group has developed and implemented an Operational Loss Database. Operational loss and "near miss" events are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions taken on an ongoing basis, including measures to improve security and control procedures. Key Risk Indicators have also been developed along with thresholds which are being closely monitored for breaches. Risk Evaluation exercise is carried out for new products, processes and systems or any significant change in the existing product, processes and systems as per the operational risk policy of the Group.

# 47.4 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk of loss to the Group arising from its inability to meet obligations as they fall due or to fund growth in assets, without incurring unacceptable cost or losses.

Key elements of the Group’s liquidity risk management are as follows:

- To maintain a comfortable margin of excess liquidity in the form of cash and readily marketable assets to meet the Group’s funding requirements at any time.
- To keep a strong focus on mobilization of low-cost core deposits from customers.
- To maintain a realistic balance between the behavioral maturity profiles of assets and liabilities.
- To maintain excellent credit rating (as borrowing cost and ability to raise funds are directly affected by credit rating).
- To have a written contingency funding plan to address any hypothetical situations when access to normal sources of funding is constrained.

# 47.4.1 Liquidity Coverage Ratio

SBP issued BPRD Circular No. 08 dated June 23, 2016 advising implementation of Basel III liquidity standards that constitute two ratios, i.e., Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), and five monitoring tools.

LCR is the measure of conversion capability of the Bank’s High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) into cash to meet immediate liquidity requirements over a 30 days horizon.

The Bank calculates Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) on monthly basis as per the guidelines given in the above mentioned circular. The objective of LCR is to ensure the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile which requires the Bank to maintain sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) to meet stressed cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar days period. As of 31 December 2024, the Bank’s LCR stood at 236.302% against SBP’s minimum requirement of 100%.

# 47.4.2 Governance of Liquidity Risk Management

Liquidity risk is managed through the liquidity risk policy approved by the Board. The Group has “zero tolerance” for liquidity risk and will continue to maintain a comfortable margin of excess liquidity in the form of cash and readily marketable assets to meet its funding requirements at any time. Management of liquidity risk is accomplished through a formal structure which includes:

- Board of Directors (BOD)
- Risk Management Committee
- Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO)
- Treasury Division
- Risk Management Division and Middle Office
- Finance Division
- Information Technology Division

The Board of Directors approves the liquidity risk policy and ensures, through quarterly reviews by the Risk Management Committee of the Board, that the Group’s liquidity risk is being managed prudently. Risk Management Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Group’s liquidity risk. Liquidity position is monitored daily by the Treasury Division and the Middle Office and reviewed regularly by ALCO.

# 47.4.3 Funding Strategy

The Group’s prime source of liquidity is the customers' deposit base. Within deposits, the Group strives to maintain core deposit base in form of current and saving deposits and avoids concentration in particular products, tenors and dependence on large fund providers. As a general rule, the Group will not depend on borrowings in the inter-bank market, including repos, to be a part of its permanent pool of funds for financing of loans, but will use these as a source for obtaining moderate amounts of additional funds to meet temporary liquidity needs in the normal course of business or for money market operations.

# 47.4.4 Liquidity Risk Mitigation Techniques

Various tools and techniques are used to measure and monitor the possible liquidity risk. These include monitoring of different liquidity ratios like core deposits to total deposits, advances to deposits, liquid assets to total deposits, Interbank borrowing to total deposits, which are monitored on regular basis against limits. Further, the Group also prepares the maturity profile of assets and liabilities to monitor the liquidity gaps over different time bands. For maturity analysis, behavioral study is carried out to determine the behavior of non-contractual assets and liabilities. The Group also ensures that statutory cash and liquidity requirements are maintained at all times.

In addition, LCR, NSFR and Monitoring Tools of Basel III framework further strengthen liquidity risk management of the Group.

# 47.4.5 Liquidity Stress Testing

As per SBP FSD Circular No. 01 of 2020, Liquidity stress testing is being conducted under various stress scenarios. Shocks include the withdrawals of deposits, withdrawals of wholesale / large deposits & interbank borrowing, withdrawal of top deposits, etc. Results of stress testing are presented to ALCO and Risk Management Committee. The Group’s liquidity risk management addresses the goal of protecting solvency and the ability to withstand stressful events in the market place. Stress testing for liquidity as prescribed in the liquidity risk policy is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of decline in liquidity on the ratio of liquid assets to deposits plus borrowings.

# 47.4.6 Contingency Funding Plan

Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) is a part of liquidity risk policy of the Group which identifies the trigger events that could cause a liquidity contingency and describes the actions to be taken to manage it. The contingency funding plan highlights liquidity management actions that needs to be taken to deal with the contingency. Responsibilities and response levels are also incorporated in order to tackle the contingency. Moreover, CFP highlights possible funding sources, in case of a liquidity contingency.

# 47.4.7 Main Components of LCR

Main components of LCR are High Quality Liquid Assets and Net Cash Outflows. Outflows are mainly deposit outflows net of cash inflows which consist of inflows from financing and money market placements up to 1 month. The inputs for calculation of LCR are based on SBP BPRD Circular No. 08 dated 23 June 2016.

# 47.4.8 Composition of High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs)

High Quality Liquid Assets consist of Level 1 Assets which are included in the stock of liquid assets at 100% weightage of their market value i.e., Cash and Treasury balances, Conventional Government Securities, GOP Ijarah Sukuks, Foreign Currency Sukuks and Bonds issued by sovereigns. While Level 2 Assets comprise all equity shares (excluding shares of Financial Institutions) listed on PSX 100.

# 47.4.9 Concentration of Funding Sources

The Group relies on customers' deposits as its key source of funding, especially current and saving deposits and time deposits of small / medium denominations, and avoids concentration of large deposits. Share of core deposits in total deposits and of large deposits in total deposits are regularly monitored. In particular the Group does not depend on large depositors or borrowings from SBP and financial institutions to meet its funding requirements.

# 47.4.10 Currency Mismatch in the LCR

About 90% of the Group's assets and liabilities are in local currency. Currency mismatch in other currencies is regularly monitored.

# 47.4.11 Centralisation of Liquidity Management

Overall liquidity management of the Group is centralised in Treasury Division at Principal Office. The Group mobilises deposits through its branch network. It also uses the branch network to grant loans to customers. Branches that have more deposits than loans, transfer (“lend”) their excess deposits to the Principal Office. Branches that do not have enough deposits to fund their loans, acquire (“borrow”) additional funds from the Principal Office.

# 47.4.12 Other Inflows and Outflows

Benefit of pledged deposits (deposits under lien) are not accounted for in calculation of LCR.

# 47.4.13 Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)

NSFR is the ratio of the amount of Available Stable Funding (ASF) - source of funds, capital and liabilities relative to the amount of Required Stable Funding (RSF) - use of funds, assets and off - balance sheet exposures. The objective of NSFR is to ensure the availability of stable funds that a Bank must hold to enable it to build and maintain its assets, investments and off balance sheet portfolio on an ongoing basis for longer term, i.e., over a one year horizon. NSFR reduces maturity mismatches between the asset and liability items on the balance sheet and thereby reduces funding and roll - over risk. The Bank’s NSFR stood at 184.937% as on 31 December 2024.

# 47.5 Maturities of Assets and Liabilities

based on contractual maturity of the assets and liabilities of the Group

The following maturity profile is based on contractual maturities for assets and liabilities that have a contractual maturity. Assets and liabilities that do not have a contractual maturity have been categorised in the shortest maturity band.

# 47.6 Maturities of assets and liabilities - based on expected maturities of the assets and liabilities of the Group

For assets and liabilities that have a contractual maturity, the expected maturity is considered to be the same as contractual maturity. Assets and Liabilities that do not have a contractual maturity have been categorised on the basis of expected maturities as determined by ALCO. In case of saving and current accounts, their historical net withdrawal pattern over the next one year was reviewed, based on year-end balances for the last three years. Thereafter, taking a conservative view, ALCO categorised these deposits in various maturity bands. Other assets and liabilities have been categorised on the basis of assumptions / judgments that are believed to be reasonable.

Special Pool(s) PKR (Mudaraba)

Special pool(s) are created where the customers desire to invest in high yield assets. In case of loss in a special pool the loss will be borne by the special pool members.

General Pool FCY (Mudaraba)

Islamic Export Refinance Scheme (IERS) Pool PKR (Musharaka)

Equity Pool

Investments with relatively higher risks such as investment in shares and mutual funds are tagged to the equity pool in order to safeguard the interest of depositors.

Special Mudaraba Financing Facility (SMFF) Pool - Open Market Operations (OMO) Injections

Special Mudaraba Financing Facility (MFF) Pool for OMO Injection is created to invest the funds exclusively raised from SBP through Islamic Open Market Operations (OMO) in High Quality Assets including securities that are eligible as approved securities for maintaining Statutory Liquidity Requirement (SLR).

Parameters associated with risk and rewards:

Following are the key considerations attached with risk and reward of the pool:
- Period, return, safety, security and liquidity of investment.
- Maturities of funds obtained from Principal Office, Islamic Banking Institutions and Shariah compliant organisations as regulated in Pakistan.
- Element of risk attached to various types of investments.
- SBP rules and Shariah clearance.

# 10.2 Avenues / sectors of economy / business where Mudaraba based deposits have been deployed

The Mudarba based funds have been deployed in the following avenues / sectors / businesses:

- Chemical and pharmaceuticals
- Agribusiness
- Textile
- Sugar
- Shoes and leather garments
- Investment in sukuk
- Production and transmission of energy

# 10.3 Parameters used for allocation of profit, charging expenses and provisions etc. along with a brief description of their major components

The Bank’s Islamic Banking Division (IBD) is accepting Term Deposits and Saving Deposits under Mudaraba arrangements, wherein the Bank is Mudarib and depositors are Rab-Ul-Maal. The Bank with the prior approval of Depositors also commingles its funds with those of depositors.

The funds so generated are invested by the Bank in Shariah compliant modes of financing and investments such as Murabaha, Ijarah, Istisna, Diminishing Musharakah, Running Musharakah, Musawama, Shares, Mutual Funds and Sukuks etc.

The Bank calculates the profit of the pool every month. Profit is distributed at the Net Income level. Net Income is calculated after deducting direct costs such as cost of Murabaha, cost of Takaful, Depreciation on Ijarah Assets, and amortization of premium on sukuks and loss of investments directly incurred in deriving that Income.

The Net income / loss is being allocated between the Bank’s equity and the depositors’ fund in proportion to their respective share in pool.

The Bank’s profit sharing ratio during the quarter was 50% (2023: 50%) of Net Income and the depositors’ profit sharing ratio was 50% (2023: 50%) of Net Income.

After the allocation of Income between mudarib (Bank) and depositors (Rab ul Maal) the profit is distributed among the depositors on the basis of predetermined weightages, announced by the Bank at the beginning of the month based on their respective category / tiers. In case of loss, Rab-ul-Maal has to bear the loss in the ratio of its investment.

In case of provisioning, the general and specific provisions created against non-performing financing, credit loss allowance under IFRS-9 and diminution in the value of investments as under prudential regulations and other SBP directives shall be borne by the IBIs as Mudarib. However, write-offs of financings and loss on sale of investments shall be charged to the pool along with other direct expenses.

# Disclosure on Complaint Handling in Annual Accounts-2024

The Customer Services function takes contentment in serving as custodian of Complaint Management which is primarily in control of upholding high FTC (Fair Treatment to Customers) standards by promptly resolving complaints and providing fair resolutions to customers.

To promote customer centricity in the culture and dynamics of BAHL, we have developed a comprehensive policy for handling customer complaints that is established on the values of fairness, transparency, promptness, visibility, and accessibility. BAHL take complaints as an effective measure to improve its services instead of considering complaints as root cause for customer dissatisfaction. Additionally, Fair Treatment to Consumers Committee (FTCC) is established to anticipate customer problems and recommend resolution that can give our customers a better experience.

Customers can register complaints through a variety of channels, including a call center, the bank’s website, direct emails, social media, and letters delivered directly or through drop box to the customer services division. These complaints are swiftly recorded in the complaint management system. From the time a complaint is acknowledged until it is resolved, bank has a defined escalation matrix to resolve complaints, where if any complaint is not resolved within the allotted turnaround time, it is escalated to the next senior level of management to ensure resolution of the complaints on priority.

As a post resolution activity, the complaint trends and analysis are shared with Board Members, Senior Management and Business Segments. Based on the findings, root cause analysis is conducted and communicated timely with the relevant departments for reduction of customer grievance.

# Key Highlight:

In 2024, the Bank received 337,053 complaints, about 15% higher than the previous year. The complaints were investigated and closed within an average turnaround time of 4 working days.

# Gender Pay Gap as on 31 December 2024
