# DIRECTORS’ REVIEW

It is our pleasure to present the un-audited financial statements of Bank AL Habib Limited along with the un-audited consolidated financial statements of Bank AL Habib Limited and the Bankʼs Subsidiaries AL Habib Capital Markets (Private) Limited, AL Habib Asset Management Limited, and AL Habib Exchange Company (Private) Limited for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

By the Grace of Allah, we are pleased to inform you that the “AL Habib Exchange Company (Private) Limited” (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank) has commenced its operations from March 26, 2024.

Alhamdolillah, during the period under review, the performance of the Bank continued to be satisfactory. The deposits increased to Rs. 2,087.6 billion as compared to Rs. 1,934 billion on December 31, 2023. In the same period, advances decreased to Rs. 809.8 billion from Rs. 869.5 billion, while investments increased to Rs. 1,598.8 billion from Rs. 1,503.9 billion. The pre-tax profit of the Bank for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was Rs. 19.19 billion as compared to Rs. 16.56 billion during the corresponding period last year. The profit after tax for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was Rs. 10.01 billion compared with Rs. 10.54 billion during 2023.

Alhamdolillah, the Bank has successfully implemented International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9 in accordance with the requirements of the State Bank of Pakistan. As a result of this implementation, the impact on equity (net of tax) amounted to Rs. 3.57 billion.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting held on April 25, 2024, has declared an interim cash dividend of 35%, i.e., Rs. 3.50 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

By the Grace of Allah, the Bank now has a network of 1,139 offices, comprising 1,106 branches, 29 sub-branches, and 4 Representative Offices. Our branch network includes 223 Islamic Banking Branches and 2 Overseas Branches. Continuing with our branch expansion policy, the Bank intends to open more branches during the year 2024.

Alhamdolillah, Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) has maintained the Bank's long term entity and short term entity ratings at AAA (Triple A) and A1+ (A One plus), respectively. This long term credit rating AAA (Triple A) denotes the highest credit quality with the lowest expectation of credit risk, and indicates exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.

The ratings of our unsecured, subordinated Term Finance Certificates (TFCs) are AAA (Triple A) for TFC-2018, TFC-2021 and TFC-2022, and AA+ (Double A plus) for TFC-2017 (perpetual) and TFC-2022 (perpetual). These ratings denote a very low expectation of credit risk emanating from a very strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments. Further, the TFC-2022 & the TFC-2022 (perpetual) issued in 2022, were listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pursuant to Chapter 5C of PSX Rule Book.

We wish to thank our customers, for their continued trust and support, local & foreign correspondents for their confidence and cooperation, and the State Bank of Pakistan for their guidance. We also thank all our staff members for their sincerity, dedication, and hard work.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

# 2.1

In accordance with the directives of the Federal Government regarding the shifting of the banking system to Islamic modes, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued various circulars from time to time. Permissible forms of trade-related modes of financing includes purchase of goods by banks from customers and immediate resale to them at appropriate mark-up in price on deferred payment basis. The purchase and resale arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements as such, but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilised and the appropriate portion of mark-up thereon. However, the Islamic Banking branches of the Bank have complied with the requirements set out under the Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS), issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2017.

# 2.2

Key financial information of the Islamic Banking branches is disclosed in note 41 to these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 2.3

These are separate financial statements of the Bank in which investments in subsidiaries and associates are reported on the basis of direct equity interest and are not consolidated or accounted for by using equity method of accounting.

# 2.4 Statement of compliance

These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards comprise of:

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- IFAS issued by ICAP, as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by SBP and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by SBP and SECP differ with the requirements of the IFRS or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated 09 February 2023 issued the revised format for the preparation of the annual / interim financial statements of the banks. New formats are applicable for interim / annual financial statements for period beginning on or after 01 January 2024. The implementation of the revised format has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the interim financial statements. Right of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities are now presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position. Previously, they were presented under property and equipment and other liabilities.

The disclosures made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on the format prescribed by SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 02, dated 09 February 2023 and International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting'. They do not include all the information required in the annual financial statements, and these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2023 except for adoption of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' as described in Note 3.1.1.

SBP has deferred the applicability of IAS 40, 'Investment Property' for Banking Companies in Pakistan through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated 26 August 2002 till further instructions. SECP has deferred the applicability of IFRS 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' through its notification S.R.O 411 (I) / 2008 dated 28 April 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 04 dated 25 February 2015, has clarified that the reporting requirements of IFAS 3, 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits' for Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) relating to annual, half yearly and quarterly financial statements would be notified by SBP through issuance of specific instructions and uniform disclosure formats in consultation with IBIs. These reporting requirements have not been ratified to date. Accordingly, the disclosure requirements under IFAS 3 have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

IFRS 10, 'Consolidated Financial Statements' was made applicable from period beginning on or after 01 January 2015 vide S.R.O 633 (I) / 2014 dated 10 July 2014 by SECP. However, SECP has directed through S.R.O 56 (I) / 2016 dated 28 January 2016 that the requirement of consolidation under section 228 of the Companies Act, 2017 and IFRS 10, 'Consolidated Financial Statements' is not applicable in case of investment by companies in mutual funds established under trust structure.

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policy information related to preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the annual financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2023 except for adoption of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' as described in Note 3.1.1.

# 3.1 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published approved accounting standards that are effective in the current period

There are certain new and amended standards that became effective during the period. However, these are considered either not to be relevant or not to have any significant impact on the Bank's unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements except for IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', as disclosed below:

# 3.1.1 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

As per BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated 23 April 2023, the effective date for the implementation of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is accounting period beginning on or after January 1, 2024. SBP has issued detailed instructions on the application of the Standard, including transitional provisions, impact on the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) calculation and reporting requirements.

The adoption of IFRS 9 has brought fundamental changes to the recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. Classification of financial assets is based on assessment of the business model (BM) and contractual cash flow characteristics i.e. solely payment of principal and interest (SPPI) test of the financial assets. IFRS 9 requires that credit losses on financial assets are measured and recognised using the 'Expected Credit Loss' (ECL) approach. Credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL framework.

Financial assets under IFRS 9 will be classified into the following three classification categories:

- Amortised Cost (AC)
- Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)
- Fair Value through Profit or Loss Account (FVTPL)

A financial asset should be measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows. A financial asset should be measured at FVOCI, if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and also selling on favourable market conditions. On derecognition of debt security, the resulting gain or loss previously recognised in OCI will be reclassified from equity to the profit and loss account. On derecognition of equity security, gains and losses previously recognised in OCI will not be recycled through the profit and loss account but will be transferred directly to retained earnings.

Any financial asset that does not fit any of the above two categories, will be measured at FVTPL. The Bank has followed modified retrospective approach for restatement and has not restated comparative figures on the initial application. Adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the equity as on 01 January 2024.

# The following table illustrates reconciliation of carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities from their previous categories to the new categories at the date of transition on 01 January 2024:

|Carrying amount as on 31 December 2023|Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)|Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) - with recycling|Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) - without recycling|Amortised Cost (AC)|Adjustments / remeasurements under IFRS 9|Expected Credit Loss (ECL) - Charge|Gross impact|Tax impact|Balances as on 01 January 2024| |

# FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction. Fair value of financial instruments is based on:

- Federal Government Securities: PKRV rates (Reuters page)
- Foreign Securities: Market prices / Mashreqbank PSC
- Listed Securities: Prices quoted at Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited
- Mutual Funds: Net asset values declared by respective funds
- Unlisted Equity Investments: Break - up value as per latest available audited financial statements

Fair value of fixed term advances of over one year, staff loans and fixed term deposits of over one year cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to non-availability of relevant active market for similar assets and liabilities.

# 36.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period / year.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 41.8 Profit and Loss Distribution and Pool Management

# 41.8.1 The number and nature of pools maintained by the Islamic Banking Branches along with their key features and risk and reward characteristics

|General Pool PKR (Mudaraba)|Deposits which assume minimal risk of loss due to diversified assets being tagged thereto are parked in the general pool. In case of loss in general pool, the loss will be borne by the general pool members.|
|---|---|
|Special Pool(s) PKR (Mudaraba)|Special pool(s) are created where the customers desire to invest in high yield assets. In case of loss in a special pool the loss will be borne by the special pool members.|
|General Pool FCY (Mudaraba)|In FCY pool, all FCY deposits and investments are parked to share the return among the FCY deposit holders. In case of loss in a FCY general pool, the loss will be borne by the FCY general pool members.|
|Special Pool(s) FCY (Mudaraba)|Special pool(s) are created where the customers desire to invest in high yield assets. In case of loss in a special pool the loss will be borne by the special pool members.|
|Islamic Export Refinance Scheme (IERS) Pool PKR (Musharaka)|IERS pool is required by SBP to facilitate the exporters under Islamic Export Refinance Scheme.|
|Equity Pool|Investments with relatively higher risks such as investment in shares and mutual funds are tagged to the equity pool in order to safeguard the interest of depositors. The Bank as Mudarib in the general pool is responsible for administrative costs and cost of operating fixed assets, which are financed from equity. Furthermore, subsidised financing to employees are also financed from equity as per SBP guidelines.|
|Special Mudaraba Financing Facility (SMFF) Pool - Open Market Operations (OMO) Injections|Special Mudaraba Financing Facility (SMFF) Pool for OMO Injection is created to invest the funds exclusively raised from SBP through Islamic Open Market Operations (OMO) in High Quality Assets including securities that are eligible as approved securities for maintaining Statutory Liquidity Requirement (SLR).|

# Parameters associated with risk and rewards:

Following are the key considerations attached with risk and reward of the pool:

- Period, return, safety, security and liquidity of investment.
- Maturities of funds obtained from Principal Office, Islamic Banking Institutions and Shariah compliant organisations as regulated in Pakistan.
- Element of risk attached to various types of investments.
- SBP rules and Shariah clearance.

# 41.8.2 Avenues / sectors of economy / business where Mudaraba based deposits have been deployed

The Mudaraba based funds have been deployed in the following avenues / sectors / businesses:

- Chemical and pharmaceuticals
- Agribusiness
- Textile
- Sugar
- Shoes and leather garments
- Investment in sukuk
- Production and transmission of energy
- Food and allied except sugar
- Cement
- Financial
- Wheat
- Individuals
- Others (domestic whole sale, engineering goods, plastic product, etc.)

# 41.8.3 Parameters used for allocation of profit, charging expenses and provisions etc. along with a brief description of their major components

The Bank's Islamic Banking Division is accepting the deposits and gains under Mudaraba arrangements, wherein the Bank is Mudarib and depositors are Rab-Ul-Maal. The Bank with the prior approval of depositors also commingles its funds with those of depositors.

The funds so generated are invested by the Bank in Shariah compliant modes of financing and investments such as Murabaha, Ijarah, Istisna, Diminishing Musharakah, Running Musharakah, Musawama, Shares, Mutual Funds and Sukuks etc.

The Bank calculates the profit of the pool at every month. Profit is distributed at the Net Income level. Net Income is calculated after deducting direct costs such as Cost of Murabaha, Cost of Takaful, Depreciation on Ijarah Assets, and Amortization of Premium on Sukuks and Loss of Investments directly incurred in deriving that Income.

The net income loss is being allocated between the Bank's equity and the depositors' fund in proportion to their respective share in pool.

The Bank's profit sharing ratio during the quarter was of net income and the depositors' profit sharing ratio was of net income.

After the allocation of Income between the equity holder and depositors the profit is distributed among the account holders on the basis of predetermined weightages, announced by the Bank at the beginning of the month based on their respective category / tiers. In case of loss, Rab-ul-Maal has to bear the loss in the ratio of its investment.

In case of provisioning, the general and specific provisions created against non-performing financing and diminution in the value of investments as under prudential regulations and other SBP directives shall be borne by the IBIs as Mudarib. However, write-offs of financings and loss on sale of investments shall be charged to the pool along with other direct expenses.

# 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

# 2.1

In accordance with the directives of the Federal Government regarding the shifting of the banking system to Islamic modes, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued various circulars from time to time. Permissible forms of trade-related modes of financing includes purchase of goods by banks from customers and immediate resale to them at appropriate mark-up in price on deferred payment basis. The purchase and resale arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements as such, but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilised and the appropriate portion of mark-up thereon. However, the Islamic Banking branches of the Bank have complied with the requirements set out under the Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS), issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2017.

# 2.2

Key financial information of the Islamic Banking branches is disclosed in note 42 to these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 2.3 Statement of Compliance

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards comprise of:

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- IFAS issued by ICAP, as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017;
- Directives issued by SBP and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by SBP and SECP differ with the requirements of the IFRS or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail. SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated 09 February 2023 issued the revised format for the preparation of the annual / interim financial statements of the banks. New formats are applicable for interim / annual financial statements for period beginning on or after 01 January 2024. The implementation of the revised format has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the interim financial statements. Right of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities are now presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position. Previously, they were presented under property and equipment and other liabilities.

The disclosures made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on the format prescribed by SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 02, dated 09 February 2023 and International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting'. They do not include all the information required in the annual financial statements, and these consolidated condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2023 except for adoption of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' as described in Note 3.1.1.

SBP has deferred the applicability of IAS 40, 'Investment Property' for Banking Companies in Pakistan through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated 26 August 2002 till further instructions. SECP has deferred the applicability of IFRS 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' through its notification S.R.O 411 (I) / 2008 dated 28 April 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 04 dated 25 February 2015, has clarified that the reporting requirements of IFAS 3, 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits' for Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) relating to annual, half yearly and quarterly financial statements would be notified by SBP through issuance of specific instructions and uniform disclosure formats in consultation with IBIs. These reporting requirements have not been ratified to date. Accordingly, the disclosure requirements under IFAS 3 have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

IFRS 10, 'Consolidated Financial Statements' was made applicable from period beginning on or after 01 January 2015 vide S.R.O 633 (I) / 2014 dated 10 July 2014 by SECP. However, SECP has directed through S.R.O 56 (I) / 2016 dated 28 January 2016 that the requirement of consolidation under section 228 of the Companies Act, 2017 and IFRS 10, 'Consolidated Financial Statements' is not applicable in case of investment by companies in mutual funds established under trust structure.

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policy information related to preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the annual financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2023 except for adoption of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' as described in Note 3.1.1.

# 3.1 Standards, interpretations and amendments to published approved accounting standards that are effective in the current period

There are certain new and amended standards that became effective during the period. However, these are considered either not to be relevant or not to have any significant impact on the Group's consolidated condensed interim financial statements except for IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', as disclosed below:

# 3.1.1 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

As per BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated 23 April 2023, the effective date for the implementation of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is accounting period beginning on or after January 1, 2024. SBP has issued detailed instructions on the application of the Standard, including transitional provisions, impact on the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) calculation and reporting requirements.

The adoption of IFRS 9 has brought fundamental changes to the recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. Classification of financial assets is based on assessment of the business model (BM) and contractual cash flow characteristics i.e. solely payment of principal and interest (SPPI) test of the financial assets. IFRS 9 requires that credit losses on financial assets are measured and recognised using the 'Expected Credit Loss' (ECL) approach. Credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL framework.

# Financial Asset Classification

Financial assets under IFRS 9 will be classified into the following three classification categories:

- Amortised Cost (AC)
- Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)
- Fair Value through Profit or Loss Account (FVTPL)

A financial asset should be measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows. A financial asset should be measured at FVOCI, if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and also selling on favorable market conditions. On derecognition of debt security, the resulting gain or loss previously recognised in OCI will be reclassified from equity to the profit and loss account. On derecognition of equity security, gains and losses previously recognised in OCI will not be recycled through the profit and loss account but will be transferred directly to retained earnings.

Any financial asset that does not fit any of the above two categories, will be measured at FVTPL.

The Bank has followed modified retrospective approach for restatement and has not restated comparative figures on the initial application. Adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the equity as on 01 January 2024.

# The following table illustrates reconciliation of carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities from their previous categories to the new categories at the date of transition on 01 January 2024:

|Carrying amount as on|Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)|Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) - with recycling|Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) - without recycling|Amortised Cost (AC)|Adjustments / remeasurement under IFRS 9|Expected Credit Loss (ECL) - Charge|Gross impact|Tax impact|Balances as on 01 January 2024| |

# 37. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction. Fair value of financial instruments is based on:

|Federal Government securities|PKRV rates (Reuters page)|
|---|---|
|Foreign securities|Market prices / Mashreqbank PSC|
|Listed securities|Prices quoted at Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited|
|Mutual funds|Net asset values declared by respective funds|
|Unlisted equity investments|Break - up value as per latest available audited financial statements|

Fair value of fixed term advances of over one year, staff loans and fixed term deposits of over one year cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to non-availability of relevant active market for similar assets and liabilities.

# 37.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period / year.

# 42.8.3 Parameters used for allocation of profit, charging expenses and provisions etc. along with a brief description of their major components

The Bankʼs Islamic Banking Division (IBD) is accepting Term Deposits and Saving Deposits under Mudaraba arrangements, wherein the Bank is Mudarib and depositors are Rab-Ul-Maal. The Bank with the prior approval of depositors also commingles its funds with those of depositors.

The funds so generated are invested by the Bank in Shariah compliant modes of financing and investments such as Murabaha, Ijarah, Istisna, Diminishing Musharakah, Running Musharakah, Musawama, Shares, Mutual Funds and Sukuks etc.

The Bank calculates the profit of the pool at every month. Profit is distributed at the Net Income level. Net Income is calculated after deducting direct costs such as Cost of Murabaha, Cost of Takaful, Depreciation on Ijarah Assets, and Amortization of Premium on Sukuks and Loss of Investments directly incurred in deriving that Income.

The net income / loss is being allocated between the Bankʼs equity and the depositorsʼ fund in proportion to their respective share in pool.

The Bankʼs profit sharing ratio during the quarter was 50% (2023: 50%) of Net Income and the depositorsʼ profit sharing ratio was 50% (2023: 50%) of Net Income.

After the allocation of Income between the equity holder and depositors the profit is distributed among the account holders on the basis of predetermined weightages, announced by the Bank at the beginning of the month based on their respective category / tiers. In case of loss, Rab-ul-Maal has to bear the loss in the ratio of its investment.

In case of provisioning, the general and specific provisions created against non-performing financing and diminution in the value of investments as under prudential regulations and other SBP directives shall be borne by the IBIs as Mudarib. However, write-offs of financings and loss on sale of investments shall be charged to the pool along with other direct expenses.
