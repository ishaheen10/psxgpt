# DIRECTORS’ REVIEW

It is our pleasure to present the un audited financial statements of Bank AL Habib Limited along with the un audited consolidated financial statements of Bank AL Habib Limited and the Bank’s Subsidiaries AL Habib Capital Markets Private Limited, AL Habib Asset Management Limited and AL Habib Exchange Company Private Limited for the half year ended June 30, 2020.

Alhamdolillah during the period under review the performance of the Bank continued to be satisfactory. The deposits increased to Rs  1 9 billion as compared to Rs  1 9 billion on December 31, 2019. In the same period, advances decreased to Rs  9 billion from Rs  69.5 billion while investments increased to Rs  1 6.1 billion from Rs  1 50.9 billion. The pre tax profit of the Bank for the half year ended June 30, 2020 was Rs  0.50 billion as compared to Rs  0.95 billion during the corresponding period last year. The profit after tax for the half year ended June 30, 2020 was Rs  1.09 billion compared with Rs  1.09 billion during 2019.

The Board of Directors in its meeting held on August 20, 2020 has declared an interim cash dividend of Rs  5.50 per share i.e. 5.50 in addition to 5 already paid, bringing the total cash dividend to 10.50 for the half year ended June 30, 2020.

By the grace of Allah, the Bank now has a network of 115 offices comprising 115 branches, 9 sub branches, and 3 Representative Offices. Our branch network includes 29 Islamic Banking Branches and 5 overseas Branches. Continuing with our branch expansion policy, the Bank intends to open more branches during the year 2020.

Alhamdolillah, Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) has maintained the Bank’s long term entity and short term entity ratings at AAA (Triple A) and A1+ (A One Plus) respectively. This long term credit rating AAA (Triple A) denotes the highest credit quality with the lowest expectation of credit risk and indicates exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.

The ratings of our unsecured subordinated term Finance Certificates (FCs) are AAA (Triple A) for FC 01 and FC 02, and AA+ (Double A Plus) for FC 01 perpetual and FC 02 perpetual. These ratings denote a very low expectation of credit risk emanating from a very strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments. Further, the FC 01 and the FC 02 perpetual issued in 2019 were listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pursuant to Chapter 5C of PSX Rule Book. During the second quarter of the year, the Bank has fully redeemed its unsecured subordinated FC 01 on June 06, 2020.

We wish to thank our customers for their continued trust and support, local and foreign correspondents for their confidence and cooperation, and the State Bank of Pakistan for their guidance. We also thank all our staff members for their sincerity, dedication, and hard work.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT

To the members of Bank AL Habib Limited

# Report on Review of Unconsolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements

# Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position of Bank AL Habib Limited (the Bank) as at 30 June 2024 and the related unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of changes in equity and unconsolidated condensed interim cash flow statement and notes to the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements for the six month period then ended (hereinafter referred to as the "unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements"). Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements based on our review.

# Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2400, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity". A review of unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements consists of making inquiries primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

# Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

# Other Matters

The figures of the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account and the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income for the three months period ended 30 June 2024 have not been reviewed and we do not express a conclusion on them.

The unconsolidated financial statements for the half year ended 30 June 2024 and for the year ended 31 December 2023 were respectively reviewed and audited by another firm of chartered accountants who had expressed an unmodified conclusion and opinion thereon vide their reports dated 5 August 2024 and 1 February 2024 respectively.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor’s review report is Muhammad Taufiq.

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UN-AUDITED)

# FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024

# 1. STATUS AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

Bank AL Habib Limited (the Bank) is a banking company incorporated in Pakistan on 15 October 1991 as a public limited company under repealed Companies Ordinance 1984, having its registered office at 16-C Old Bahawalpur Road, Multan with principal place of business in Karachi. Its shares are listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited. It is a scheduled bank principally engaged in the business of commercial banking with a network of 115 branches (31 December 2010: 110 branches, 31 December 2009: 99 sub-branches, 31 December 2008: 0 representative offices, 31 December 2007: 0 representative offices, and 10 booths (31 December 2009: 9 booths). The branch network of the Bank includes 0 overseas branches (31 December 2010: 0 overseas branches) and 9 Islamic Banking branches (31 December 2010: 1 Islamic Banking branches).

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

# 2.1

In accordance with the directives of the Federal Government regarding the shifting of the banking system to Islamic modes, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued various circulars from time to time. Permissible forms of trade related modes of financing include purchase of goods by banks from customers and immediate resale to them at appropriate mark up in price on deferred payment basis. The purchase and resale arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements as such, but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilised and the appropriate portion of mark up thereon. However, the Islamic Banking branches of the Bank have complied with the requirements set out under the Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the provisions of the Companies Act 2017.

# 2.2

Key financial information of the Islamic Banking branches is disclosed in note 10 to these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 2.3

These are separate financial statements of the Bank in which investments in subsidiaries and associates are reported on the basis of direct equity interest and are not consolidated or accounted for by using equity method of accounting.

# 2.4 Statement of compliance

These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards comprise of:

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act 2017.
- IFAS issued by ICAP as are notified under the Companies Act 2017.
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance 1962 and the Companies Act 2017.
- Directives issued by SBP and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance 1962, the Companies Act 2017 or the directives issued by SBP and SECP differ with the requirements of the IFRS or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance 1962, the Companies Act 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

SBP vide its BPR Circular No. 0 dated 09 February 2020 issued the revised format for the preparation of the annual and interim financial statements of the banks. New formats are applicable for interim and annual financial statements for periods beginning on or after 01 January 2020. The implementation of the revised format has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the interim financial statements. The adoption of the revised format has resulted in the following significant changes:

- Right of use assets (note 1) amounting to Rs 1,109 million (December 31, 2019: Rs 11,969 million) which were previously shown as part of property and equipment are now shown separately on the statement of financial position.
- Lease liabilities (note 2) amounting to Rs 15,555 million (December 31, 2019: Rs 1,616 million) which were previously shown as part of other liabilities are now shown separately on the statement of financial position.

The disclosures made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on the format prescribed by SBP vide BPR Circular No. 0 dated 09 February 2020 and International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting. They do not include all the information required in the annual financial statements, and these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2019, except for adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments as described in Note 1.

SBP has deferred the applicability of IAS 40 Investment Property for Banking Companies in Pakistan through BS Circular Letter No. 10 dated 6 August 2000 till further instructions. SECP has deferred the applicability of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures through its notification S.R.O. 11(I)/2000 dated 12 April 2000. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

SBP vide its BPR Circular No. 0 dated 5 February 2015 has clarified that the reporting requirements of IFAS 1 Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits for Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) relating to annual, half yearly and quarterly financial statements would be notified by SBP through issuance of specific instructions and uniform disclosure formats in consultation with IBIs. These reporting requirements have not been ratified to date. Accordingly, the disclosure requirements under IFAS have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements was made applicable from periods beginning on or after 01 January 2015 vide S.R.O. 6(I)/2015 dated 10 July 2015 by SECP. However, SECP has directed through S.R.O. 56(I)/2016 dated 31 January 2016 that the requirement of consolidation under section 237 of the Companies Act 2017 and IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements is not applicable in case of investment by companies in mutual funds established under trust structure.

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policy information related to preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements is consistent with that applied in the preparation of the annual financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 1 December 0 except for adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments as described in Note 1.

# 3.1 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published approved accounting standards that are effective in the current period

There are certain new and amended standards that became effective during the period. However, these are considered either not to be relevant or not to have any significant impact on the Bank's unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements except for IFRS 9 Financial Instruments as disclosed below.

# 3.1.1 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

During the period, as directed by SBP vide its BPR Circular Letter No 0 of 0 dated April 1, 0, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments became applicable to Bank. BPR Circular No 0 of 0 dated July 05, 0 issued by SBP provides detailed instructions on implementation of IFRS 9. The Application Instructions for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks.

IFRS 9 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 9 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement. The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement, and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach rather than incurred credit losses approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 in its entirety from January 01, 0 using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 0 reporting period as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the standard.

IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of the accounting for financial liabilities. SBP has allowed certain amendments and extended the timelines of the Application Instructions to address several banking industry concerns vide its BPR Circular Letter No 16 dated July 9, 0.

# 3.1.2 Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Bank's business model in which financial assets are held will determine whether the financial assets are to be measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit or loss (FPL) when they are held for trading purposes or at amortized cost. Financial liabilities classified as FPL are measured at fair value. Financial liabilities classified at amortized cost are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method.

IFRS 9 allows entities to irrevocably designate at initial recognition a financial asset as measured at FPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different bases. SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion: a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout the life of the instrument. Nonetheless, banks should avoid this option for financial instruments that are categorized as Level 1 in terms of the IFRS 13 hierarchy.

# 3.1.3 Business model assessment

The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:

- the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets, or realizing cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Bank’s management;
- the risks that affect the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model and its strategy for how those risks are managed;
- how managers of the business are compensated (e.g., whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected); and
- the frequency, volume, and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales, and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realized.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking worst case or stress case scenarios into account.

# 3.1.4 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest / profit (SPPI)

For the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as profit margin.

# 3.1.5 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

# Financial assets at FVTPL

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses including any profit markup or dividend income are recognised in profit or loss.

# Financial assets at amortised cost

These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Profit, foreign exchange gains and losses, and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.

# Debt investments at FVOCI

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Profit income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses, and impairment are recognised in the income statement. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to the income statement.

# Equity investments at FVOCI

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to the income statement.

# 3.1.6 Application to the Bank's financial assets

# Equity Securities:

Quoted equity shares are classified as FVOCI. Gains and losses on disposal of securities classified as FVPL will be recycled through the profit and loss account. The Bank has elected to designate equity shares at FVOCI as permitted under IFRS 9. These securities were previously classified as available for sale (AFS). The changes in fair value of such securities will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss when they are disposed of.

# Debt securities and Islamic financing and related assets:

Debt securities currently classified as AFS and passing the SPPI test are measured at FVOCI under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold these assets to collect contractual cash flows and sell the investments. Debt securities currently classified as held to maturity (HM) and passing the SPPI test are measured at amortised cost under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold these assets to collect contractual cash flows. Debt securities that do not pass the SPPI test are measured at FVPL.

# 3.1.7 Derecognition

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

- substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred; or
- the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its statement of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

In derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between:

1. the carrying amount measured at the date of derecognition; and
2. the consideration received, including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed,

shall be recognised in profit or loss.

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

In derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the profit or loss account.

# 3.1.8 Modification

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of financing to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification are accounted for as follows:

- Fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and
- Other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.

If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the bank first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognises the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset. This requirement will be implemented on and after 1 October 2020, as mentioned in BPR Circular Letter No. 16 of 2020 of SBP.

# 3.1.9 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FCI with recycling other than equity instruments, lease receivables, and certain financing commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees is required for expected credit losses (ECL) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (1 month ECL). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL).

Financial assets where 1 month ECL is recognised are in Stage 1; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in Stage 2; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in Stage 3.

Under SBP’s instructions, the Bank is not required to compute ECL on government securities and on government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. Further, the bank is required to calculate ECL on its Stage 3 financial assets as higher of facility wise provision under Prudential Regulations (PR) and ECL under IFRS 9. Further, the Banks are advised to recognise income on impaired assets (loans classified under PRs i.e., AEM and Stage 3 loans) on a receipt basis in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations issued by SBP.

Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 and SBP's IFRS 9 application instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

- P: The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (1 month ECL - Stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL - Stage 2).
- EA: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments, and forward looking information where relevant.
- L: An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. L is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

# 3.1.10 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of obligor Risk Ratings (RR) or where principal and/or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of stage 2 if they meet the requirements of PR issued by SBP. As per the Bank's policy, financial assets in stage 2 may be reclassified to stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum period of 6 months from initial downgrade is required before any facility is moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to move back from Stage 2 to Stage 1, it should meet the criteria defined under the respective Prudential Regulations for declassification of account/facility. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 2 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure C of BPR Circular no. 1 of 2020. However, banks are free to choose more stringent days past due criteria.

# 3.1.11 Undrawn financing commitments:

When estimating lifetime ECL for undrawn financing commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financing commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the financings are drawn down, based on a probability weighting of the three scenarios.

There is no material change in Bank’s tax contingences as disclosed in note 22.4 to the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 except for Deputy Commissioner Inland Revenue (DCIR) has passed an order against Federal Excise Duty levy on certain items pertaining to accounting year 2020 and 2021.

# 25. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Bank deals in derivative financial instruments namely forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps with the principal view of hedging the risks arising from its trade business. As per the Bank’s policy, these contracts are reported on their fair value at the statement of financial position date. The gains and losses from revaluation of these contracts are included under “income from dealing in foreign currencies”. Unrealised gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in the statement of financial position under “other assets / other liabilities”. These products are offered to the Bank’s customers to protect from unfavourable movements in foreign currencies. The Bank hedges such exposures in the inter-bank foreign exchange market.

|36.|FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS| | | |
| |Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction. Fair value of financial instruments is based on:| | | |
| |Federal Government securities|PKRV rates (Reuters page)| | |
| |Foreign securities|Market prices / Mashreqbank PSC| | |
| |Listed securities|Prices quoted at Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited| | |
| |Mutual funds|Net asset values declared by respective funds| | |
| |Unlisted equity investments|Break - up value as per latest available audited financial statements| | |


Fair value of fixed term advances of over one year, staff loans and fixed term deposits of over one year cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to non-availability of relevant active market for similar assets and liabilities.

# 36.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period / year.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

- Period return, safety, security and liquidity of investment
- Maturities of funds obtained from Principal Office, Islamic Banking Institutions and Shariah compliant organisations as regulated in Pakistan
- Element of risk attached to various types of investments
- SBP rules and Shariah clearance

# 40.8.2 Avenues / sectors of economy / business where Mudaraba based deposits have been deployed

The Mudaraba based funds have been deployed in the following avenues / sectors / businesses:

- Chemical and pharmaceuticals
- Agribusiness
- Textile
- Sugar
- Shoes and leather garments
- Investment in sukuk
- Production and transmission of energy
- Food and allied except sugar
- Cement
- Financial
- Heat
- Individuals
- Others: domestic wholesale engineering goods, plastic products, etc.

# 40.8.3 Parameters used for allocation of profit, charging expenses and provisions etc. along with a brief description of their major components

The Bank’s Islamic Banking Division (IB) is accepting term deposits and saving deposits under Mudaraba arrangements wherein the Bank is Mudarib and depositors are Rab ul Maal. The Bank, with the prior approval of depositors, also commingles its funds with those of depositors.

The funds so generated are invested by the Bank in Shariah compliant modes of financing and investments such as Murabaha, Ijarah, Istisna, Diminishing Musharakah, Running Musharakah, Musawama, Shares, Mutual Funds, and Sukuks, etc.

The Bank calculates the profit of the pool at every month. Profit is distributed at the Net Income level. Net Income is calculated after deducting direct costs such as cost of Murabaha, cost of Takaful, depreciation on Ijarah Assets, and amortization of premium on sukuks and loss of investments directly incurred in deriving that Income.

The Net income/loss is being allocated between the Bank’s equity and the depositors’ fund in proportion to their respective share in the pool. The Bank’s profit sharing ratio during the quarter was 50% (1 December 20) and the depositors’ profit sharing ratio was 50% (1 December 20).

After the allocation of Income between the equity holder and depositors, the profit is distributed among the account holders on the basis of predetermined weightages announced by the Bank at the beginning of the month based on their respective category/tiers. In case of loss, Rab ul Maal has to bear the loss in the ratio of its investment.

In case of provisioning, the general and specific provisions created against non-performing financing and diminution in the value of investments as under prudential regulations and other SBP directives shall be borne by the IBIs as Mudarib. However, write-offs of financings and loss on sale of investments shall be charged to the pool along with other direct expenses.

# 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

# 2.1

In accordance with the directives of the Federal Government regarding the shifting of the banking system to Islamic modes, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued various circulars from time to time. Permissible forms of trade-related modes of financing includes purchase of goods by banks from customers and immediate resale to them at appropriate mark-up in price on deferred payment basis. The purchase and resale arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements as such, but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilised and the appropriate portion of mark-up thereon. However, the Islamic Banking branches of the Bank have complied with the requirements set out under the Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS), issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2017.

# 2.2

Key financial information of the Islamic Banking branches is disclosed in note 41 to these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 2.3 Statement of Compliance

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards comprise of:

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- IFAS issued by ICAP, as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017;
- Directives issued by SBP and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by SBP and SECP differ with the requirements of the IFRS or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail. SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated 09 February 2023 issued the revised format for the preparation of the annual / interim financial statements of the banks. New formats are applicable for interim / annual financial statements for period beginning on or after 01 January 2024. The implementation of the revised format has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the interim financial statements. The adoption of revised format has resulted in following significant changes:

- Right-of-use-assets (note 12) amounting to Rs. 12,833.632 million (31 December 2023: Rs. 11,969.724 million) which were previously shown as part of property and equipment are now shown separately on the consolidated statement of financial position.

- Lease liabilities (note 20) amounting to Rs. 15,789.655 million (31 December 2023: Rs. 14,633.878 million) which were previously shown as part of other liabilities are now shown separately on the consolidated statement of financial position.

The disclosures made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on the format prescribed by SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 02, dated 09 February 2023 and International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting'. They do not include all the information required in the annual financial statements, and these consolidated condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2023 except for adoption of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' as described in Note 3.1.1.

SBP has deferred the applicability of IAS 40, 'Investment Property' for Banking Companies in Pakistan through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated: 26 August 2002 till further instructions. SECP has deferred the applicability of IFRS 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' through its notification S.R.O 411 (I) / 2008 dated: 28 April 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 04 dated: 25 February 2015, has clarified that the reporting requirements of IFAS 3, 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits' for Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) relating to annual, half yearly and quarterly financial statements would be notified by SBP through issuance of specific instructions and uniform disclosure formats in consultation with IBIs. These reporting requirements have not been ratified to date. Accordingly, the disclosure requirements under IFAS 3 have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

IFRS 10, 'Consolidated Financial Statements' was made applicable from period beginning on or after 01 January 2015 vide S.R.O 633 (I) / 2014 dated: 10 July 2014 by SECP. However, SECP has directed through S.R.O 56 (I) / 2016 dated: 28 January 2016 that the requirement of consolidation under section 228 of the Companies Act, 2017 and IFRS 10, 'Consolidated Financial Statements' is not applicable in case of investment by companies in mutual funds established under trust structure.

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policy information related to preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements is consistent with that applied in the preparation of the annual financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2023 except for adoption of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' as described in Note 3.1.1.

# 3.1 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published approved accounting standards that are effective in the current period

There are certain new and amended standards that became effective during the period. However, these are considered either not to be relevant or not to have any significant impact on the Group's consolidated condensed interim financial statements except for IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', as disclosed below:

# 3.1.1 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

During the period, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated 13 April 2023, IFRS 9: ʻFinancial Instruments' became applicable to the Bank. BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 issued by SBP provides detailed instructions on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks.

IFRS 9 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ʻExpected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than ʻincurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 in its entirety from 01 January 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the standard. IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of the accounting for financial liabilities.

SBP has allowed certain amendments and extended the timelines of the Application Instructions to address several banking industry concerns vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated 29 July 2024.

# 3.1.2 Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Bank's business model in which financial assets are held will determine whether the financial assets are to be measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI') or fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL').

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortized cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value. Financial liabilities classified at amortized cost are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method.

IFRS 9 allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any 'accounting mismatch' that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different bases. SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout life of the instrument. Nonetheless, banks should avoid this option for financial instruments that are categorized as Level 3 in terms of the IFRS 13 hierarchy.

# 3.1.3 Business model assessment

The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:

- the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Bank’s management;
- the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and its strategy for how those risks are managed;
- how managers of the business are compensated (e.g., whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected); and
- the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking “worst case” or “stress case” scenarios into account.

# 3.1.4 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest / profit (SPPI)

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as profit margin.

# 3.1.5 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

# Financial assets at FVTPL

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any profit / markup or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.

# Financial assets at amortised cost

These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Profit, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.

# Debt investments at FVOCI

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Profit income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in income statement. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to income statement.

# Equity investments at FVOCI

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to income statement.

# 3.1.6 Application to the Bank's financial assets

# Equity Securities:

Quoted equity shares are classified as FVOCI & FVTPL. Gains and losses on disposal of securities classified as FVTPL will be recycled through the profit and loss account. The Bank has elected to designate equity shares at FVOCI as permitted under IFRS 9. These securities were previously classified as available-for-sale (AFS). The changes in fair value of such securities will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss when they are disposed off.

# Debt securities and Islamic financing and related assets:

Debt securities currently classified as AFS and passing the SPPI test are measured at FVOCI under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold these assets to collect contractual cash flows and sell the investments. Debt securities currently classified as held-to-maturity (HTM) and passing the SPPI test are measured at amortized cost under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold these assets to collect contractual cashflows. Debt securities that do not pass the SPPI test measured at FVTPL.

# 3.1.7 Derecognition

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its statement of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between:

1. the carrying amount (measured at the date of derecognition); and
2. the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) shall be recognised in profit.

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the profit or loss account.

# 3.1.8 Modification

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of financing to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognized and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification are accounted for as follows:

- fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and
- other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.

If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the bank first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognises the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred, and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

This requirement will be implemented on and after 1 October 2024 as mentioned in BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 of SBP.

# 3.1.9 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI - with recycling (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain financing commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses ('ECL') resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months ('12-month ECL'). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument ('lifetime ECL').

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognized are in 'Stage 1'; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in 'Stage 2'; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in 'Stage 3'.

Under SBPʼs instructions, the Bank is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. Further the bank is required to calculate ECL on its Stage 3 financial assets as higher of facility wise provision under Prudential Regulations (PR) and ECL under IFRS 9. Further, the Banks are advised to recognize income on impaired assets (loans classified under PRs i.e., OAEM and Stage 3 loans) on a receipt basis in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations issued by SBP.

Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 and SBP's IFRS 9 application instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12-month ECL, Stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2).
- EAD: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortization, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.
- LGD: An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

# 3.1.10 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and/or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PR issued by SBP. As per Bank's policy, financial assets in stage 2 may be reclassified to stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum period of 3 months from initial downgrade is required before any facility is moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to move back from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it should meet the criteria defined under the respective Prudential Regulations for de-classification of account / facility. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022. However, banks are free to choose more stringent days past due criteria.

# 3.1.11 Undrawn financing commitments

When estimating lifetime ECL for undrawn financings commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the financings are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

|37.|FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS| | | |
| |Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction. Fair value of financial instruments is based on:| | | |
| |Federal Government Securities|PKRV rates (Reuters page)| | |
| |Foreign Securities|Market prices / Mashreqbank PSC| | |
| |Listed Securities|Prices quoted at Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited| | |
| |Mutual Funds|Net asset values declared by respective funds| | |
| |Unlisted Equity Investments|Break - up value as per latest available audited financial statements| | |


Fair value of fixed term advances of over one year, staff loans and fixed term deposits of over one year cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to non-availability of relevant active market for similar assets and liabilities.

# 37.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period / year.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

- Period, return, safety, security and liquidity of investment.
- Maturities of funds obtained from Principal Office, Islamic Banking Institutions and Shariah compliant organisations as regulated in Pakistan.
- Element of risk attached to various types of investments.
- SBP rules and Shariah clearance.

# 41.8.2 Avenues / sectors of economy / business where Mudaraba based deposits have been deployed

The Mudarba based funds have been deployed in the following avenues / sectors / businesses:

- Chemical and pharmaceuticals
- Agribusiness
- Textile
- Sugar
- Shoes and leather garments
- Investment in sukuk
- Production and transmission of energy
- Food and allied except sugar
- Cement
- Financial
- Wheat
- Individuals
- Others (domestic whole sale, engineering goods, plastic product, etc.)

# 41.8.3 Parameters used for allocation of profit, charging expenses and provisions etc. along with a brief description of their major components

The Bankʼs Islamic Banking Division (IBD) is accepting Term Deposits and Saving Deposits under Mudaraba arrangements, wherein the Bank is Mudarib and depositors are Rab-Ul-Maal. The Bank with the prior approval of Depositors also commingles its funds with those of depositors.

The funds so generated are invested by the Bank in Shariah compliant modes of financing and investments such as Murabaha, Ijarah, Istisna, Diminishing Musharakah, Running Musharakah, Musawama, Shares, Mutual Funds and Sukuks etc.

The Bank calculates the profit of the pool at every month. Profit is distributed at the Net Income level. Net Income is calculated after deducting direct costs such as cost of Murabaha, cost of Takaful, Depreciation on Ijarah Assets, and amortization of premium on sukuks and loss of investments directly incurred in deriving that Income.

The Net income / loss is being allocated between the Bankʼs equity and the depositorsʼ fund in proportion to their respective share in pool.

The Bankʼs profit sharing ratio during the quarter was 50% (31 December 2023: 50%) of Net Income and the depositorsʼ profit sharing ratio was 50% (31 December 2023: 50%) of Net Income.

After the allocation of Income between the equity holder and depositors the profit is distributed among the account holders on the basis of predetermined weightages, announced by the Bank at the beginning of the month based on their respective category / tiers. In case of loss, Rab-ul-Maal has to bear the loss in the ratio of its investment.

In case of provisioning, the general and specific provisions created against non-performing financing and diminution in the value of investments as under prudential regulations and other SBP directives shall be borne by the IBIs as Mudarib. However, write-offs of financings and loss on sale of investments shall be charged to the pool along with other direct expenses.
