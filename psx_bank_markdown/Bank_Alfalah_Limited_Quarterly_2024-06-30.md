On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements of Bank Alfalah Limited for the half year ended June 30, 2024.

# Economic Review

The first half of 2024 witnessed several key events, including General Elections, and conclusion of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). IMF SBA has also paved way for a USD 7.0 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement with the IMF, for which the staff-level agreement has recently been reached. Economic indicators also depicted growth in real GDP with enhanced FX reserves which was instrumental towards stabilising the overall economy of the domain.

Pakistan (SBP) reported an increase in foreign exchange reserves to USD 9.4 billion, up from USD 8.2 billion on December 31, 2023. This rise is primarily due to inflows from the IMF under the recent SBA and a current account surplus observed from January to May 2024. Exports rose by 10.6% due to higher rice and high-value-added textile shipments, while imports fell by 5.3% due to lower global commodity prices and improved domestic agricultural output (July 23 to Apr 24). Consequently, the country’s total reserves, including those held by the banks, have risen to USD 14.6 billion from USD 12.7 billion at the end of 2023. This growth reflects the positive effects of external financial support and improved economic conditions.

Furthermore, supported by economic stability and increased investor confidence, the Pakistani Rupee strengthened by 1.3% against the US Dollar, improving from PKR 281.86/USD on December 31, 2023, to PKR 278.34/USD as of June 30, 2024.

Inflation fell to 12.6% YoY in June 2024, as compared to 29.7% YoY in December 2023. Fiscal year 2024 average inflation clocked-in at 23.9% compared to 29.0% in the preceding fiscal year.

In response to improved inflation conditions and a decrease in core inflation pressures, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has reduced the policy rate by 150 bps to 20.5% during June 2024. This adjustment comes after a gradual drop in inflation numbers since Feb’24. Although there are some risks on account of budgetary measures and anticipated increase in energy prices, the Committee believes that previously taken monetary tightening measures will continue to help in keeping inflation under control. The MPC also believes that a moderate growth is expected, supported by improvement in capacity utilisation, enhanced consumer and business sentiments, and a projected decrease in inflation will be supportive in this regard.

# Directors’ Review

As of June 30, 2024, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported an increase in foreign exchange reserves to USD 9.4 billion, up from USD 8.2 billion on December 31, 2023. This rise is primarily due to inflows from the IMF under the recent SBA and a current account surplus observed from January to May 2024.

The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) depicted strong performance during the period, with the benchmark KSE-100 rising by 25.6% during the first half of 2024.

# HALF YEARLY REPORT - JUNE 30, 2024

CY24, closing at 78,445 points. This was largely driven by improving fundamentals and influx of liquidity from both domestic and international investors.

In conjunction with the positive trajectory of the country's fiscal health, a recent report by Fitch has expressed optimism that easing inflation will provide the SBP with the opportunity to reduce its policy rate in the near future. The report also forecasts a relatively stable exchange rate, with only minor currency depreciation anticipated for the remainder of the year, in contrast to the significant deterioration observed over the past few years. Furthermore, the IMF’s board is expected to approve the EFF arrangement soon, which will help ensure continued macroeconomic stability. This support is likely to increase the confidence in the economy going forward.

# Review of the Bank’s Performance

Highlights of the Bank’s financial results for the half year ended June 30, 2024, are presented as follows:

# Financial Position

| |June 30, 2024|December 31, 2023|
|---|---|---|
|Shareholders’ Equity|147,971|137,923|
|Total Assets|3,353,908|3,345,917|
|Deposits|2,101,808|2,084,997|
|Advances – net|772,121|735,052|
|Investments – net|2,037,735|2,067,263|

# Financial Performance

| |Half year ended June 30, 2024|Half year ended June 30, 2023|
|---|---|---|
|Net Interest Income and Non-Markup Income|81,211|72,234|
|Non-Markup Expenses|39,086|31,367|
|Credit loss allowance / Provisions and write offs (net)|1,307|5,002|
|Profit before tax (PBT)|40,819|35,865|
|Profit after tax (PAT)|20,609|18,620|
|Basic and Diluted earnings per share – Rupees|13.07|11.81|

Bank Alfalah posted profit after tax of PKR 20.609 billion for the half year ended June 30, 2024, with earnings per share of PKR 13.07 (June 2023: PKR 11.81). The Bank’s PBT of PKR 40.819 billion was 13.8% higher than the same period last year (SPLY); while PAT showed an improvement of 10.7%. The Bank maintained strict control over expenses and managed costs prudently, while simultaneously focusing on generating revenue growth through expansion, while ensuring investments in new ventures were not compromised. The Bank's strategy of opening new branches and investing in new ventures was not compromised.

# Bank Alfalah

Digital technologies and IT platforms, along with the impact of inflation, resulted in higher operating costs. Since the beginning of 2023, the Bank has also opened over 150 new branches, which aid in customer acquisition and therefore revenue growth. This translated to the Banks’ cost to income ratio standing at 46.7%.

Owing to Bank’s carefully planned and executed strategy, deposits closed at PKR 2.102 trillion at the end of the period, with YoY growth of 18.3%. Gross financing book of the Bank closed at PKR 820.004 billion, growing by 2.7% YOY, as a result of prudent and cautious credit origination amid challenging market conditions. Our disciplined underwriting and rigorous client selection processes have continued to benefit us, as reflected in non-performing loan ratio of 4.9%. Non-performing loans remain fully covered with a coverage ratio of 118.5% (including general provision / expected credit loss (ECL)). The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 with effect from January 1, 2024 that has resulted in a net positive impact on opening equity amounting to PKR 2.049 billion. As at June 30, 2024, the Bank remains adequately capitalised with CAR at 17.13%.

# Dividend

The Board of Directors, in its meeting held on August 01, 2024, declared an interim cash dividend of PKR 2.00 per share (20%) for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, bringing the total interim cash dividend for the year to PKR 4.00 per share (40%) (2023: PKR 3.00 per share (30%)). The Board had earlier declared and paid an interim cash dividend of PKR 2.00 per share (20%).

# Credit Rating

The Bank has been assigned the following ratings by PACRA:

- Entity rating: Upgraded to ‘AAA’ (Triple A) for the long-term and maintained at ‘A1+’ (A-One Plus) for the short-term, with a ‘Stable’ Outlook.
- Instruments’ rating: Credit rating of Unsecured Tier 1 Capital instruments (Term Finance Certificates) of the Bank was also upgraded to ‘AA+’ (Double A Plus), with a ‘Stable’ Outlook.

The assigned ratings reflect the Bank’s diversified operations, healthy financial risk profile, strong sponsors, and prominent market presence. These ratings denote a very low level of credit risk, and the highest capacity for timely repayment of financial commitments.

# Future Outlook

Building on our past achievements, Bank Alfalah is poised for significant growth. As we continue to build on our strategic initiatives, we aim to expand our deposit base with an emphasis on low-cost deposits and enhance our domestic presence to deliver exceptional services. Our key areas of focus include supporting the consumer sector, facilitating SME growth, and leveraging technological advancements to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Enhancing trade volumes, increasing cash management penetration, and strengthening our supply chain financing and home remittance capabilities are integral in our commitment to adapting to industry and global developments.

Human capital development remains a priority, ensuring we maintain a skilled and motivated workforce. Our culture of care has aligned us with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, amplifying our impact through strengthened Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives.

# UNCONSOLIDATED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# HALF YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

# Independent Auditors’ Review Report

# HALF YEARLY REPORT - JUNE 30, 2024

To the members of Bank Alfalah Limited

# Report on review of interim financial statements

# Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position of Bank Alfalah Limited (“the Bank”) as at June 30, 2024 and the related unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of changes in equity and unconsolidated condensed interim cash flow statement, and notes to the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements for the half year then ended (here-in-after referred to as the "interim financial statements"). Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements based on our review.

The figures for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account and unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income have not been subject to review and therefore, we do not express a conclusion thereon.

# Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity". A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

# Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor’s review report is Noman Abbas Sheikh.

# For the half year ended June 30, 2024

# BANK ALFALAH LIMITED

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Un-audited)

# FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

# 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION

# 2.1 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. The accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting comprise of:

- International Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IAS 34, IFRS or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

The SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment Property' for banking companies through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002 till further instructions. Further, the SECP has deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' on banks through its notification S.R.O 411(I)/2008 dated April 28, 2008. The State Bank of Pakistan through BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2015 dated February 25, 2015 has deferred the applicability of Islamic Financial Accounting Standard-3 for Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits (IFAS-3) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) and notified by the SECP, vide their SRO No. 571 of 2013 dated June 12, 2013 for Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services (IIFS). Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

As allowed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022, IFRS 9 has not been adopted for overseas branches where it is not applicable as per their local regulations. In addition to the above, the SBP has recently issued BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024 in which certain relaxations / clarifications have been provided upon adoption of IFRS 9 which are disclosed in note 4.2 to the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 2.1.1

The disclosures made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on the format prescribed by the SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 02 dated February 09, 2023 and the requirements of International Accounting Standard 34, "Interim Financial Reporting". These do not include all the information and disclosures required for annual financial statements, and therefore should be read in conjunction with the annual audited unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 2.1.2

These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements represent separate financial statements of Bank Alfalah Limited in which investment in subsidiaries and associates are accounted for on the basis of cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

# 2.1.3

Key financial figures of the Islamic Banking branches are disclosed in note 43 to these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 2.1.4

The Bank believes that there is no significant doubt on the ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

# 2.2 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published accounting and reporting standards that are effective in the current period:

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2024 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any material effect on the Bank's operations and are therefore not detailed in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements except for IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments), the impact of which is disclosed under note 4.2.

# 2.3 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective:

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2025 but are considered not to be relevant or will not have any material effect on the Bank's financial statements except for:

- the new standard - IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (IFRS 18) (published in April 2024) with applicability date of January 01, 2027 by IASB. IFRS 18 is yet to be adopted in Pakistan. IFRS 18 when adopted and applicable shall impact the presentation of 'Statement of Profit and Loss Account' with certain additional disclosures in the financial statements.
- amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' which clarify the date of recognition and derecognition of a financial asset or financial liability including settlement of liabilities through banking instruments and channels including electronic transfers. The amendment when applied may impact the timing of recognition and derecognition of financial liabilities.

# 3 BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

# 3.1 Accounting convention

These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain property and equipment and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims which are stated at revalued amounts; investment classified at fair value through profit or loss and at fair value through other comprehensive income, investments and derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value; defined benefit obligations which are carried at present value; and right of use of assets and related lease liability measured at present value on initial recognition.

# 3.2 Functional and presentation currency

These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are presented in Pakistani Rupees, which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency. The amounts are rounded off to the nearest thousand rupees.

# 4 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policies applied in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the annual audited unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for changes mentioned in notes 4.1 and 4.2.

# 4.1 Adoption of revised forms for the preparation of the condensed interim financial statements

The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 09, 2023, issued the revised forms for the preparation of the condensed interim quarterly / half yearly financial statements of the Banks / DFIs which are applicable for quarterly / half yearly periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 as per BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023. The implementation of the revised forms has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements. The significant change is relating to right of use assets and corresponding lease liability which are now presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position. Previously, these were presented under property and equipment (earlier titled as fixed assets) and other liabilities respectively. There is no impact of this change on the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements in terms of recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities. The Bank has adopted the above changes in the presentation and made additional disclosures to the extent applicable to its operations and corresponding figures have been rearranged / reclassified to correspond to the current period presentation, as presented in note 48.2.

# 4.2 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

As per SBP BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9 is applicable on banks with effect from January 01, 2024. IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of accounting for financial liabilities. To determine appropriate classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments, to be assessed based on combination of the entity's business model for managing the assets and the instruments' contractual cash flow characteristics. The adoption of IFRS 9 has also fundamentally changed the impairment method of financial assets with a forward-looking Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach.

The SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 has made certain amendments and extended the timelines of SBP's IFRS 9 Application Instructions to address most of the matters raised by the banks with a direction to ensure compliance by the extended timeline. There are a few matters which include maintenance of general provision, income recognition on islamic financings and fair valuation of subsidized loans, the treatments of which are still under deliberation with the SBP. The Bank has continued to follow the treatment adopted in respect of these matters in the prior periods till the time SBP issues the relevant guidance / clarification.

# 4.2.1 Classification

HALF YEARLY REPORT - JUNE 30, 2024

# Financial assets

Under IFRS 9, existing categories of financial assets: Held for trading (HFT), Available for sale (AFS), Held to maturity (HTM) and loans and receivables have been replaced by:

- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss account (FVTPL)
- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- Financial assets at amortised cost

# Financial liabilities

Under IFRS 9, the accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus financial liabilities are being carried at amortised cost except for derivatives which are being measured at FVTPL.

# 4.2.2 Business model assessment

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Bank's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether the management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Bank's key management personnel;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sale are also important aspects of the assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress scenarios' into account.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:

1. Hold to Collect (HTC) business model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash flows
2. Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S) business model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
3. Other business models: Resulting in classification of financial assets as FVTPL

# 4.2.3 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest / profit (SPPI)

As a second step of its classification process, the Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. For the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium / discount). The most significant elements of interest / profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as, but not limited to, the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest / profit rate is set. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL.

# 4.2.4 Application to the Bank's financial assets

# Debt based financial assets

Debt based financial assets held by the Bank include: advances, lending to financial institutions, investment in federal government securities, corporate bonds and other private sukuks, cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks, and other financial assets.

a) These are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as FVTPL:

- the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

The business model for these financial assets can still be HTC even when sales of these financial assets occur. However, if more than an infrequent number of sales of significant value are made, the Bank assesses whether and how the sales are consistent with the HTC objective.

b) Debt based financial assets are measured at FVOCI only if these meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as FVTPL:

- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

c) Debt based financial assets if these are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

The application of these policies also resulted in classifications and consequent remeasurements of certain investments in PIBs and Ijarah Sukuk held under available for sale portfolio as of December 31, 2023 to hold to collect based on the business model assessment. The following table reconciles their carrying amounts as reported on December 31, 2023 to the carrying amounts under IFRS 9 on transition to IFRS 9 on January 01, 2024:

Equity based financial assets

An equity instrument held by the Bank for trading purposes is classified as measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. The Bank has decided to classify Rs 767.222 million out of its available for sale equity investment (listed shares) portfolio as of December 31, 2023 as FVTPL.

IFRS 9 has eliminated impairment assessment requirements for investments in equity instruments. Accordingly, the Bank has reclassified impairment of Rs. 59.818 million on listed equity investments and Rs. 88.038 million for unlisted equity investment held as at December 31, 2023 to surplus / deficit on revaluation of investments through remeasurements.

The measurement category and carrying amount of financial assets in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan before and after adoption of IFRS 9 as at January 1, 2024 are compared as follows:

|Financial assets|Measurement category|Carrying amount as at December 31, 2023|Measurement category|Carrying amount as at January 01, 2024|

# HALF YEARLY REPORT - JUNE 30, 2024

# 4.2.5 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Bank purchases or sells the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like advances, lending to financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the account or financial institutions. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased.

# a) Amortised cost (AC)

Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest income / profit / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account.

# b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for debt based financial assets in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of debt based financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is transferred from surplus / deficit to unappropriated profit.

# c) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost will be directly recorded in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

# 4.2.6 Derecognition

# Financial assets

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

# Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account.

# 4.2.7 Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with all advances and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Bank recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;

- the time value of money; and

- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject customer. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 60 days past due. However, for certain portfolios, the Bank rebuts 60 DPD presumption based on behavioural analysis of its borrowers. When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Bank applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

# Based on the above process, the Bank groups its financial instruments into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

# Stage 1:

When financial instruments are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

# Stage 2:

When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

# Stage 3:

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises the LTECLs for these instruments. The Bank uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP.

# Undrawn financing commitments

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the financings is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. For revolving facilities that include both a financings and an undrawn commitment, ECLs are calculated on un-drawn portion of the facility and presented within other liabilities.

# Guarantee and letters of credit contracts

The Bank estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven and internally developed credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit contracts respectively. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within other liabilities.

# The calculation of ECLs

The Bank calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash flows, discounted at an approximation to the EIR.

The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:

# PD

The Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on statistical technique such as Transition Matrix approach. PDs for non advances portfolio is based on S&Ps global transition default matrices, PDs are then adjusted using Vicesek Model to incorporate forward looking information.

BANK ALFALAH

# HALF YEARLY REPORT - JUNE 30, 2024

# EAD

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest / profit from missed payments. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has a legal right to call it earlier. The product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail facilities, in which the Bank has the right to cancel and / or reduce the facilities with one day notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Bank does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the.

# LGD

The Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD.

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective interest rate (at reporting date), the Bank uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date). Effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The Bank considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics: When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three scenarios (a base case, an upside, a downside). Each of these is associated with different PDs. The Bank's management has only considered cash, liquid securities, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals, while calculating EADs. The credit exposure (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at segment level.

# Forward looking information

In its ECL models, the Bank relies on range of the following forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

# Definition of default

The concept of "impairment or "default" is critical to the implementation of IFRS 9 as it drives determination of risk parameters, i.e. PD, LGD and EAD. As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level for corporate / commercial / SME loan portfolios and at segment / product basis for retail portfolio. This implies that if one facility of a counterparty becomes 90+ DPD in repaying its contractual dues or as defined in PRs; all other facilities would deem to be classified as stage 3.

# CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

HALF YEARLY REPORT - JUNE 30, 2024

The preparation of unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amount of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form basis of making the judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revision to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of its revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The significant judgments made by the management in applying the Bank's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation were the same as those applied in the preparation of annual audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for matters related to adoption of IFRS 9 which have been disclosed in note 4.2 to the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# WORKERS' WELFARE FUND

# HALF YEARLY REPORT - JUNE 30, 2024

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated November 10, 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government through the Finance Act, 2008 for the levy of Workers' Welfare Fund (WWF) on banks were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order, which are currently pending. A legal advice was obtained by the Pakistan Banking Association which highlights that consequent to filing of these review petitions, a risk has arisen and the judgment is not conclusive until the review petitions is decided. Accordingly, the amount charged for Workers' Welfare Fund since 2008 has not been reversed.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as amortised cost / held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted debt securities classified as amortised cost / held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiary, is determined on the basis of valuation methodologies which are best reflective of their business model. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 39.1

Fair value of financial instruments

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 39.2

The Bank's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer, occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the current period.

# 39.3

Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values:

# 39.3.1 Fair value of financial assets

(a) Financial instruments in level 1

Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in ordinary shares of listed companies and listed non-government debt securities.

(b) Financial instruments in level 2

Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Market Treasury Bills, Pakistan Investment Bonds, GoP Sukuks, GoP Euro Bonds, Overseas Government Sukuks, Overseas Bonds, Term Finance Certificates, and other than Government Sukuks, forward foreign exchange contracts, forward government securities contracts, cross currency swap and interest rate swaps.

# (c) Financial instruments in level 3

The fair value of unquoted shares are measured at fair value based on valuation technique mentioned in the table below. The fair value of fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 39.3.2 Fair value of non-financial assets

Certain categories of property and equipment (land and buildings) and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts (level 3 measurement) determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values as disclosed in notes 12 and 16. The valuations are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of the State Bank of Pakistan.

# 39.3.3 Valuation techniques

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Market Treasury Bills (MTB) / Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIB), and GoP Sukuks (GIS) including their forward contracts|The fair value of MTBs and PIBs are derived using PKRV rates. Floating rate PIBs are revalued using PKFRV rates. The fair value of GoP sukuk listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange has been determined through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange. The fair value of other GIS are revalued using PKISRV rates.|
|Overseas Sukuks, Overseas and GoP Euro Bonds|The fair value of overseas government sukuks, and overseas bonds are valued on the basis of price available on Bloomberg.|
|Debt Securities (TFCs and Sukuk other than Government)|Investment in WAPDA Sukuks, debt securities (comprising term finance certificates, bonds and any other security issued by a company or a body corporate for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.|
|Ordinary shares - listed|The fair value of investments in listed equity securities are valued on the basis of closing quoted market price available at the Pakistan Stock Exchange.|
|Ordinary shares - unlisted|The fair value of investments in unlisted equity securities are valued on the basis of dividend discount model.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the FX revaluation rates announced by the SBP.|
|Derivative Instruments|Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques based on market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.|
|Property and equipment and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|The valuation experts used a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank's properties. The market approach used prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical, comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty accordingly a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.|

The following table summarises the quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in level 3 fair value measurements of unquoted equity securities, (The valuation techniques are stated above):

|Description|Fair value at June 30, 2024|Unobservable inputs*|Input Rate|Relationship of unobservable inputs to fair value|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Unlisted equity securities|2,107,632|Discount rate|17.1%|Increase / (decrease) in discount rate by 1% with all other variables held constant, would (decrease) / increase the fair value by Rs. 91.643 million and Rs. 99.593 million respectively.|

* There were no significant inter-relationships between unobservable inputs that materially affect fair values.

2. FCY Pool for Foreign Currency (USD, GBP, EURO, AED, SAR and CAD) depositors
3. FIs Pool for Treasury Purposes
4. IERS Pool for Islamic Export Refinance Scheme facilities
5. Special pool
6. PMRC Musharikah Pool

All the Mudaraba based remunerative deposits shall be considered as an investment from Rabbul Maal in the pool, along with IBG's own share of equity, which is also commingled in the pool. The applications of these funds are on Islamic financing and related assets, investments, and placements for generating profits to be shared among the depositors as per the weightage system. The IERS pool is maintained as per the guideline under the SBP IERS Scheme. The assets, liabilities, equities, income and expenses are segregated for each of the pool. No pool investment is intermingled with each other. All pools are usually exposed to general credit risk, asset ownership risk and profit rate risk of the underlying assets involved in pool.

# 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION

# 2.1 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. The accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting comprise of:

- International Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IAS 34, IFRS or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

The SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment Property' for banking companies through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002 till further instructions. Further, the SECP has deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' on banks through its notification S.R.O 411(I)/2008 dated April 28, 2008. The State Bank of Pakistan through BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2015 dated February 25, 2015 has deferred the applicability of Islamic Financial Accounting Standard-3 for Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits (IFAS-3) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) and notified by the SECP, vide their SRO No. 571 of 2013 dated June 12, 2013 for Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services (IIFS). Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

As allowed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022, IFRS 9 has not been adopted for overseas branches where it is not applicable as per their local regulations. In addition to the above, the SBP has recently issued BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024 in which certain relaxations / clarifications have been provided upon adoption of IFRS 9 which are disclosed in note 4.2 to the consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

Moreover, Alfalah Insurance Company Limited has deferred the application of IFRS 9 until the effective date of new insurance contracts standard (IFRS 17) as allowed by the SECP through SRO 1715 (i)/2023 dated November 21, 2023. Furthermore, Sapphire Wind Power Company Limited was granted a partial exemption from the application of IFRS 9 till December 31, 2024 vide SECP S.R.O.67(i)/2023 dated January 20, 2023. Consequently, the requirements of IFRS 9 with respect to application of Expected Credit Losses in respect of trade debts and other receivables due from Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA-G) have not been followed.

# 2.1

# Disclosures

The disclosures made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on the format prescribed by the SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 02 dated February 09, 2023 and the requirements of International Accounting Standard 34, "Interim Financial Reporting". These do not include all the information and disclosures required for annual financial statements, and therefore should be read in conjunction with the annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 2.1.2 Basis of consolidation

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its investment with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. These consolidated condensed interim financial statements incorporate the financial statements of subsidiaries from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Associates are those entities on which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Associates as well as investment in mutual funds established under trust structure are accounted for using the equity method. Non-controlling interests are that part of the net results of operations and of net assets of subsidiary which are not owned by the Holding Company. Material intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated.

# 2.1.3 Key financial figures

Key financial figures of the Islamic Banking branches are disclosed in note 43 to the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 2.1.4 Going concern

The management of the Holding company believes that there is no significant doubt on the Group company's ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

# 2.2

# Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published accounting and reporting standards that are effective in the current period:

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Group's accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2024 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any material effect on the Group's operations and are therefore not detailed in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements except for IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments), the impact of which is disclosed under note 4.2.

# 2.3

# Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective:

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Group's accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2025 but are considered not to be relevant or will not have any material effect on the Group's financial statements except for:

- the new standard - IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (IFRS 18) (published in April 2024) with applicability date of January 01, 2027 by IASB. IFRS 18 is yet to be adopted in Pakistan. IFRS 18 when adopted and applicable shall impact the presentation of 'Statement of Profit and Loss Account' with certain additional disclosures in the financial statements.
- amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' which clarify the date of recognition and derecognition of a financial asset or financial liability including settlement of liabilities through banking instruments and channels including electronic transfers. The amendment when applied may impact the timing of recognition and derecognition of financial liabilities.

# 3

# 3.2 Functional and presentation currency

The material accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the annual audited consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for changes mentioned in notes 4.1 and 4.2.

# 4.1 Adoption of revised forms for the preparation of the condensed interim financial statements

The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 09, 2023, issued the revised forms for the preparation of the condensed interim quarterly / half yearly financial statements of the Banks / DFIs which are applicable for quarterly / half yearly periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 as per BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023. The implementation of the revised forms has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the consolidated condensed interim financial statements. The significant change is relating to right of use assets and corresponding lease liability which are now presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position. Previously, these were presented under property and equipment (earlier titled as fixed assets) and other liabilities respectively. There is no impact of this change on the consolidated condensed interim financial statements in terms of recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities. The Group has adopted the above changes in the presentation and made additional disclosures to the extent applicable to its operations and corresponding figures have been rearranged / reclassified to correspond to the current period presentation, as presented in note 48.2.

# 4.2 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

As per SBP BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9 is applicable on banks with effect from January 01, 2024. IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of accounting for financial liabilities. To determine appropriate classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments, to be assessed based on combination of the entity's business model for managing the assets and the instruments' contractual cash flow characteristics. The adoption of IFRS 9 has also fundamentally changed the impairment method of financial assets with a forward-looking Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach.

The SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 has made certain amendments and extended the timelines of SBP's IFRS 9 Application Instructions to address most of the matters raised by the Holding Company with a direction to ensure compliance by the extended timeline. There are a few matters which include maintenance of general provision, income recognition on islamic financings and fair valuation of subsidized loans, the treatments of which are still under deliberation with the SBP. The Holding Company has continued to follow the treatment adopted in respect of these matters in the prior periods till the time SBP issues the relevant guidance / clarification.

# 4.2.1 Classification

Financial assets

Under IFRS 9, existing categories of financial assets: Held for trading (HFT), Available for sale (AFS), Held to maturity (HTM) and loans and receivables have been replaced by:

- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss account (FVTPL)
- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- Financial assets at amortised cost

Financial liabilities

Under IFRS 9, the accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus financial liabilities are being carried at amortised cost except for derivatives which are being measured at FVTPL.

# 4.2.2 Business model assessment

The Group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Group's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether the management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Group's key management personnel;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sale are also important aspects of the assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Group's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress scenarios into account.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:

1. Hold to Collect (HTC) business model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash flows
2. Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S) business model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
3. Other business models: Resulting in classification of financial assets as FVTPL

# 4.2.3 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest / profit (SPPI)

As a second step of its classification process, the group assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. For the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium / discount). The most significant elements of interest / profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Group applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as, but not limited to, the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest / profit rate is set. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL.

# 4.2.4 Application to the Group's financial assets

# Debt based financial assets

Debt based financial assets held by the group include: advances, lending to financial institutions, investment in federal government securities, corporate bonds and other private sukuks, cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks, and other financial assets.

a) These are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as FVTPL:

- the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

The business model for these financial assets can still be HTC even when sales of these financial assets occur. However, if more than an infrequent number of sales of significant value are made, the Group assesses whether and how the sales are consistent with the HTC objective.

b) Debt based financial assets are measured at FVOCI only if these meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as FVTPL:

- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

c) Debt based financial assets if these are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL.

BANK ALFALAH

# HALF YEARLY REPORT - JUNE 30, 2024

In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

The application of these policies also resulted in classifications and consequent remeasurements of certain investments in PIBs and Ijarah Sukuk held under available for sale portfolio as of December 31, 2023 to hold to collect based on the business model assessment. The following table reconciles their carrying amounts as reported on December 31, 2023 to the carrying amounts under IFRS 9 on transition to IFRS 9 on January 01, 2024:

Equity based financial assets

An equity instrument held by the Group for trading purposes is classified as measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. The group has decided to classify Rs 767.222 million out of its available for sale equity investment (listed shares) portfolio as of December 31, 2023 as FVTPL.

IFRS 9 has eliminated impairment assessment requirements for investments in equity instruments. Accordingly, the Group has reclassified impairment of Rs. 59.818 million on listed equity investments and Rs. 88.038 million for unlisted equity investment held as at December 31, 2023 to surplus / deficit on revaluation of investments through remeasurements.

The measurement category and carrying amount of financial assets in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan before and after adoption of IFRS 9 as at January 1, 2024 are compared as follows:

|Financial assets|Before adoption of IFRS 9*|Before adoption of IFRS 9*|After adoption of IFRS 9|After adoption of IFRS 9| | | | |

# 4.2.5 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Group purchases or sells the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like advances, lendings to financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the account or financial institutions. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased.

# a) Amortised cost (AC)

Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest income / profit / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account.

# b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for debt based financial assets in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of debt based financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is transferred from surplus / deficit to unappropriated profit.

# c) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost will be directly recorded in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

# 4.2.6 Derecognition

# Financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

The Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its consolidated condensed interim statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

# Financial liabilities

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account.

# 4.2.7 Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with all advances and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Group recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money;

# HALF YEARLY REPORT - JUNE 30, 2024

reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at transactional / facility level.

The Group has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Group considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject customer. The Group also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer / facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Group considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 60 days past due. However, for certain portfolios, the Group rebuts 60 DPD presumption based on behavioural analysis of its borrowers. When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Group applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

# Based on the above process, the Group's financial instruments are grouped into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

# Stage 1:

When financial instruments are first recognised, the Group recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Group calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

# Stage 2:

When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Group records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

# Stage 3:

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Group recognises the LTECLs for these instruments. The Group uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP.

# Undrawn financing commitments

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the Group estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the financings is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. For revolving facilities that include both a financings and an undrawn commitment, ECLs are calculated on un-drawn portion of the facility and presented within other liabilities.

# Guarantee and letters of credit contracts

The Group estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven and internally developed credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit contracts respectively. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within other liabilities.

# The calculation of ECLs

The Group calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash flows, discounted at an approximation to the EIR.

The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:

# PD

The Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on statistical technique such as Transition Matrix approach. PDs for non advances portfolio is based on S&Ps global transition default matrices, PDs are then adjusted using Vicesek Model to incorporate forward looking information.

# EAD

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest / profit from missed payments.

The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Group has a legal right to call it earlier. The product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail facilities, in which the Group has the right to cancel and / or reduce the facilities with one day notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Group does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default.

# LGD

The Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD.

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective interest rate (at reporting date), the Group uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date).

Effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Group seeks to use collateral, where possible. The Group considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics:

When estimating the ECLs, the Group considers three scenarios (a base case, an upside, a downside). Each of these is associated with different PDs.

The Group's management has only considered cash, liquid securities, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals, while calculating EADs.

The credit exposure (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at segment level.

# Forward looking information

In its ECL models, the Group relies on range of the following forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

# Definition of default

The concept of "impairment or "default" is critical to the implementation of IFRS 9 as it drives determination of risk parameters, i.e. PD, LGD and EAD.

As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level for corporate / commercial / SME loan portfolios and at segment / product basis for retail portfolio.

This implies that if one facility of a counterparty becomes 90+ DPD in repaying its contractual dues or as defined in PRs; all other facilities would deem to be classified as stage 3.

# Write-offs

# Adoption impacts

# HALF YEARLY REPORT - JUNE 30, 2024

# CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of consolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amount of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form basis of making the judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revision to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of its revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The significant judgments made by the management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation were the same as those applied in the preparation of annual audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for matters related to adoption of IFRS 9 which have been disclosed in note 4.2 to the consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The financial risk management objectives and policies adopted by the Group are consistent with those disclosed in the annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 40 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as amortised cost / held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted debt securities classified as amortised cost / held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiary, is determined on the basis of valuation methodologies which are best reflective of their business model. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 40.1 Fair value of financial instruments

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# HALF YEARLY REPORT - JUNE 30, 2024

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 40.2

The Group's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer, occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the current period.

# 40.3

Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values:

# 40.3.1 Fair value of financial assets

(a) Financial instruments in level 1

Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in ordinary shares of listed companies and listed non-government debt securities.

# 40.3.2 Fair value of non-financial assets

Certain categories of property and equipment (land and buildings) and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts (level 3 measurement) determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values as disclosed in notes 12 and 16. The valuations are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Holding Company which are also on the panel of the State Bank of Pakistan.

# 40.3.3 Valuation techniques

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Market Treasury Bills (MTB) / Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIB), and GoP Sukuks|The fair value of MTBs and PIBs are derived using PKRV rates. Floating rate PIBs are revalued using PKFRV rates. The fair value of GoP sukuk listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange has been determined through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange. The fair value of other GIS are revalued using PKISRV rates.|
|Overseas Sukuks, Overseas and GoP Euro Bonds|The fair value of overseas government sukuks, and overseas bonds are valued on the basis of price available on Bloomberg.|
|Debt Securities (TFCs and Sukuk other than Government)|Investment in WAPDA Sukuks, debt securities (comprising term finance certificates, bonds and any other security issued by a company or a body corporate for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.|
|Ordinary shares - listed|The fair value of investments in listed equity securities are valued on the basis of closing quoted market price available at the Pakistan Stock Exchange.|
|Ordinary shares - unlisted|The fair value of investments in unlisted equity securities are valued on the basis of dividend discount model.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the FX revaluation rates announced by the SBP.|
|Derivative Instruments|Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques based on market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.|
|Property and equipment and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|The valuation experts used a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Group's properties. The market approach used prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical, comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty accordingly a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.|

The following table summarises the quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in level 3 fair value measurements of unquoted equity securities, (the valuation techniques are stated above):

|Description|Fair value at June 30, 2024|Unobservable inputs*|Input Rate|Relationship of unobservable inputs to fair value|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Unlisted equity securities|2,107,632|Discount rate|17.1%|Increase / (decrease) in discount rate by 1% with all other variables held constant, would (decrease) / increase the fair value by Rs. 91.643 million and Rs. 99.593 million respectively.|

* There were no significant inter-relationships between unobservable inputs that materially affect fair values.
