# Directors’ Review

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the Consolidated Financial Statements for the half-year ended June 30, 2024.

# Macroeconomic Review

After the severe headwinds of FY’23, the economy underwent broad-based stabilization in FY’24 – moderate recovery in GDP growth, improved confidence, easing external pressures, contained twin deficits and receding inflation. Provisional estimates indicate that Pakistan’s GDP grew by 2.4% in FY’24 versus a contraction witnessed in the previous year; led by a robust 6.3% growth in agriculture and a 1.2% recovery in industrial activity. The Large Scale Manufacturing Index exhibited a growth of 0.9% in FY’24 which, while muted, was a considerable improvement over the 10.3% decline in FY’23.

Inflation has been on a downtrend since the start of the year, falling from 29.7% in Dec’23 to 12.6% in Jun’24. Average inflation for FY’24 was 23.4%, at the lower end of SBP’s forecast of 23-25% and significantly lower than the 29.2% in FY’23. The deceleration in inflation has been supported by a proactive monetary policy, improved agricultural output, fiscal consolidation and a stable currency, along with a sharp decline in food prices in H2FY’24. The trajectory has continued into FY’25, with the Jul’24 reading clocking in at 11.1%.

Pakistan’s current account recorded a $0.7 billion deficit in FY’24, the lowest in 13 years, and a nearly 80% reduction from FY’23, reflecting improvements in the trade balance and remittances. Imports remained static, increasing by 0.9% as higher imports of machinery were offset by lower petroleum imports; exports grew by 11.6%, as improved crop production boosted food exports. The trade deficit for FY’24 thus narrowed by 11%, to $22.1 billion. Remittances hit an all-time high of $3.2 billion in May’24 on account of Eid-related inflows and were up 10.7% to $30.3 billion in FY’24, a sharp reversal from the 12.6% decline in FY’23.

FX reserves at end-Jun’24 reached a 24-month high of $9.4 billion as Pakistan successfully concluded the second review under the Standby Arrangement (SBA) and received a $1.1 billion IMF tranche during the quarter. The SBA unlocked additional bilateral funding which, along with inflows from multilateral agencies helped boost reserves despite debt repayments of nearly $9.4 billion during FY’24. The external account stability has led to a rally in Pakistan’s sovereign bonds with yields for the Sep’25 maturity declining to 11% as of Jul’24 versus 40% at the start of FY’24. Reserve stability has also led to a gradual strengthening of the Rupee, which improved by 1.3% in H1’24 to Rs 278.3/$.

Pakistan’s fiscal deficit for FY’24 declined to 6.8% of GDP, from 7.7% in FY’23. More importantly, a primary surplus of 0.9% of GDP was recorded, the first surplus in 20 years. Tax collection increased by 30% to Rs 9.3 trillion; spending rose by 27%, mainly driven by current expenditure and a 43% rise in debt servicing, with only a meagre growth in the PSDP. The Federal Budget for FY’25 targets a primary surplus of 2.0% of GDP, placing an emphasis on mobilizing additional revenue. Tax collection is budgeted to rise by 39% to Rs 13.0 trillion in FY’25, with the growth expected mainly from GST and income tax. In line with IMF pre-conditions, some measures have been taken to reduce exemptions; however, as usual, little has been done to expand the tax base with most of the income tax burden falling unfairly on existing taxpayers.

The equity market has seen a sustained bull run throughout 2024, setting new records and outperforming even the most optimistic projections; the KSE Index crossed the 80,000 mark in July, before a slight recent correction. During FY’24, stocks yielded a 21-year high return of 89%; in USD terms, the return was 94%, making the PSX the world’s best performing market. Sentiments have remained strong, buoyed by currency stability, cheap valuations and expectations of lower interest rates, as well as a resumption of foreign inflows.

The SBP, after holding the status quo since June 2023, started a monetary easing cycle, cutting rates in consecutive meetings, totaling 250bps, to 19.5% in July 2024. The MPC highlighted that an improvement in the external position, a steady and continued decline in inflation and significantly positive real rates provided enough room to reduce the Policy rate in a calibrated manner to support economic activity. However, they cautioned that upside risks to inflation remained from fiscal slippages and future energy price adjustments. Private sector credit has remained stagnant throughout the year. Industry advances improved slightly by 0.7% from Dec’23 levels while deposits increased by 11.8% during the same period. During H1’24, banking spreads have declined by 35bps compared to H1’23.

# Financial Performance

HBL has delivered a consolidated profit before tax of Rs 57.8 billion for H1’24, growing by 12% over the same period last year. All businesses continued to perform strongly, with the turnaround now embedded in the international franchise. The Bank’s profit after tax rose by 10% to Rs 29.1 billion, while earnings per share improved from Rs 17.86 in H1’23 to Rs 20.18 in H1’24.

The Bank’s balance sheet grew 13% to Rs 6.2 trillion with total deposits growing by Rs 705 billion over Dec’23 to Rs 4.8 trillion. Domestic deposits increased by 20%, crossing a landmark Rs 4 trillion; this was well ahead of market growth of 11.8%, increasing market share to 13.3%. The growth was primarily in CASA deposits, with the mix improving from 85.8%.
---
in Dec’23 to 87.0% in Jun’24. Although private sector credit demand has remained restrained in 2024, domestic advances improved by 2.2% from the Mar’24 trough, increasing to Rs 1.35 trillion; all business have begun to show an uptick, with HBL’s total advances at Rs 1.8 trillion.

Average domestic deposits increased by Rs 550 billion, driving a 16% growth in the balance sheet, to Rs 4.3 trillion. With falling inflation raising expectations of a rate cut, market rates dipped, and for a period were even below the minimum deposit rate; spreads thus compressed sharply. Nevertheless, volume growth led to a 6% rise in domestic net interest income over H1’23. This was complemented by consistent growth in the international business, supported by elevated interest margins; the Bank’s total net interest income for H1’24 thus increased by 7% over the same period last year, to Rs 121.6 billion. HBL continued its dominance in fees, growing by 22% to Rs 24.2 billion for H1’24. As always, the flagship Cards franchise posted stellar results, delivering more than 45% of the fee growth; branch banking also returned a strong fee performance. Total non-fund income increased by 64% to Rs 39.5 billion with total revenue rising by 17%, to Rs 161.1 billion.

Continued high inflation for the first half of the year has increased administrative expenses by 15.8% over H1’23 to Rs 91.8 billion, trends that are in line with the industry. However, proactive cost management efforts enabled HBL to reduce expenses over the previous quarter. Consequently, the cost/income ratio reduced from 57.5% in H1’23 to 57.0% in H1’24.

An increase in non-performing loans along with a flattish loan book have induced an uptick in the infection ratio over the previous quarter, to 5.8%. As a result of prudent provisioning, the specific coverage has increased from 83% in Dec’23 to 91% in Jun’24; the total coverage remains above 100%.

# Capital Ratios

Internal capital generated by the strong results further strengthened HBL’s capital ratios during the period while also enabling a better dividend payout. The Consolidated Tier 1 CAR increased from 12.44% in Dec’23 to 12.65% in Jun’24, while total CAR increased from 16.01% to 16.32% over the same period.

# Credit Ratings

During the quarter, the Bank’s credit ratings were re-affirmed by VIS Credit Rating Company Ltd at AAA/A-1+ for long term and short term respectively. The ratings of its TFCs issued as Additional Tier 1 Capital have also been reaffirmed as AA+. The Outlook on all ratings is Stable. The ratings incorporate HBL’s position as the largest commercial bank in the country, its strong franchise and diversified operations, and reflect its robust liquidity with a diversified depositor base, sound asset quality and systemic importance.

# Dividend

The Board of Directors, in its meeting held on August 26, 2024, has declared an interim cash dividend of Rs 4.0 per share (40%) for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.
---
# Future Outlook

Despite a significant improvement in the macroeconomic back-drop over the course of the year, the country’s myriad structural weaknesses – including a narrow tax base, limited private investment, and distortions in the energy chain – are yet to be resolved. The previous SBA and the conclusion of negotiations on a 37-month, $7.0 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) have lowered the risk of policy slippages. However, lapses in the reform agenda cannot be ruled out in the currently fraught political environment. It appears that the Government has made adherence to the IMF stipulations a cornerstone of their economic policy. However, the recent electricity relief package in the Punjab flies in the face of IMF recommendations and it remains to be seen how this plays out.

While the Staff Level Agreement was celebrated with much fanfare in July, the EFF is yet to be approved by the IMF Board, and the initial euphoria has been tempered by the delays in getting this on to the Board’s agenda. The EFF is crucial given the substantial external financing needs over the next five years; while FX reserves are far healthier than in previous years, they remain at less than two months of import cover. IMF Board approval should spur further easing of credit conditions, and international ratings should improve, following Fitch’s upgrade in July. This should help in facilitating access to international funding, which has been scarce in the last two years.

Inflationary pressures have cooled, and we expect CPI to average 11%-12% in FY’25. After the strong growth in FY’24, agriculture is expected to slow; this should be compensated by stronger industrial and services growth on the back of lower rates and higher development spending with real GDP growth rising slightly, to 2.5% – 3.0%. The SBP is expected to maintain a prudent monetary policy, keeping real interest rates significantly positive. The USD/PKR parity will be supported by a benign current account as well as continued controls on capital flight.

The macro-stabilization efforts underway, however, have had a deleterious effect on the real economy, with demand for industrial and service goods slumping over the course of the last two years; a demand recovery will be gradual, at best, over FY’25. Elevated external financing needs and the revenue-driven budget will keep economic growth below its potential in the medium-term. To break this cycle and create the much-needed fiscal space to support growth, the government urgently needs to undertake structural reforms as agreed with the IMF – i) accelerating privatization of SOEs ii) decisive energy sector reforms iii) enhancing export competitiveness and iv) widening the tax base rather than taxing the already-taxed.

Despite the numerous headwinds, HBL continues to deliver improved results, expanding financial access to customers. We continue to dominate the thought leadership space, supporting the Government in every sphere, from renewable energy to cybersecurity awareness. After having helped Pakistan exit the FATF grey list, we are now helping to ensure that these actions are embedded in our institutions and policies. HBL’s digital journey continues to make strides; across all businesses, volumes are growing at an accelerated pace. Over 4.2 million users of HBL Mobile and Internet Banking transacted Rs 3.5 trillion in the first half of 2024 while Konnect volumes crossed a milestone of Rs 0.5 trillion. Konnect is a pivotal player in the growth of Pakistan’s eSports ecosystem and recently held its third “Aur Khelo” tournament, actively fostering a vibrant sports gaming community. HBL’s commitment to ESG principles is well established; recently we have started to eliminate all single-use plastic from our premises. To foster an inclusive and respectful workplace, HBL has dedicated programs for differently-abled people, an initiative that is championed from the top. Employee volunteerism is part of our ethos – from blood camps to tree plantation drives to helping the less privileged, HBL’s employees spent more than 2,000 hours of their personal time to create a better and brighter Pakistan for all.

# Appreciation and Acknowledgement

On behalf of the Board and management, we would like to place on record our appreciation for the efforts of our regulators and the Government of Pakistan, in particular the State Bank of Pakistan, the Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan. In these challenging times, they have stepped up with policies and measures that are prudent, proactive and balanced, protecting the economy, customers and people of Pakistan, while also safeguarding the integrity and soundness of the banking and financial services industry.

We are indebted to our customers, many of whom have banked with us for generations, and who continue to entrust us with their business and confidence. Our shareholders have provided steadfast support and to them, and to all our stakeholders, we are deeply grateful. The Board and the management remain committed to maintaining the highest standards of governance and we assure our stakeholders that we will be industry leaders in this area.

Lastly, but certainly not the least, we express our deepest appreciation and gratitude to our employees and their families, especially in customer facing units and branches, who continually go the extra mile, even at personal cost, to ensure that our customers are able to meet their critical needs. They are our heroes and heroines and we salute them for their dedication and tireless efforts.

On behalf of the Board

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

# FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

# 2.2

The disclosures made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been limited based on the format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 2 dated February 09, 2023 and IAS 34. These condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required for annual consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 2.3

New standards and amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become effective in the current year

As directed by SBP via BPRD Circular letter no. 7 of 2023 IFRS 9, Financial Instruments is effective in Pakistan for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. IFRS 9 has been applicable in several overseas jurisdictions at various effective dates starting from January 1, 2018. The requirements of this standard are already incorporated in the Group’s financial statements for the jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted. The results of those overseas operations where IFRS 9 is not applicable will be directly incorporated in the Group’s financial statements as per the respective host country's regulations, for the year ending December 31, 2024. The results of associated companies of the Bank, operating in Pakistan, to which IFRS 9 does not apply will be directly incorporated in the Group’s financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2024. The results of overseas associates will be incorporated in the Group’s financial statements as per the respective host country’s regulations till the adoption of IFRS 9 in those jurisdictions.

SBP via BPRD circular letter no 16 of 2024 has extended the timeline for compliance with the following requirements of IFRS 9 to accounting periods beginning October 01, 2024:

- a- Recognition of interest income / expense under the effective interest rate method;
- b- Measurement of staff loans at fair value;
- c- Accounting for modified loans.

Additionally, the same circular allows banks to continue measuring unlisted equity securities at the lower of cost or breakup value up to December 31, 2024.

Except for the implementation of IFRS 9 in Pakistan, as discussed in note 3.1, the Bank expects that amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards will not affect its financial statements in the period of initial application.

# 2.4

Amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective

There are various amendments to accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan that are not yet effective. Except for the relaxations given by SBP as mentioned in note 2.3 above, these are not likely to have a material effect on the Group’s financial statements.

# 2.5

Critical accounting estimates and judgements

The basis for accounting estimates and judgements adopted in the preparation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements is the same as that applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for changes as discussed in note 3.2.

# 3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

Except as disclosed in note 3.1, the material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 3.1

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

The key changes to the Bank’s accounting policies resulting from its adoption of IFRS 9 are summarized below:

# 3.1.1

Classification of Financial Assets

The Group classifies its financial assets, other than its investments in subsidiaries and associates, into the following categories:

- - at Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)
- - at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)
- - at Amortised Cost

Classification of Equity instruments

Equity securities that are traded in an active market and are held for trading purposes will be classified as FVTPL. Equity securities that are not held for trading purposes will be classified as FVOCI; however, gains and losses realised on disposal of securities classified as FVOCI will not be recycled through the profit and loss account. The classification decision is made on a case by case basis at the time of purchase, is documented, and is irrevocable.
---
# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

# FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

For the six months ended June 30, 2024

Unlisted equity securities will be carried at lower of cost or breakup value till December 31, 2024. Thereafter these will be carried at fair value.

# Classification of other Financial Assets

Financial Assets other than equity will be classified based on their cash flow characteristics and business model assessment:

- Amortised Cost: These will be classified as amortised cost if the objective is to hold the asset only for collecting contractual cash flows (principal and interest).
- FVOCI: These will be classified at FVOCI when the objective is to collect contractual cash flows (principal and interest) and also to potentially sell the same depending on market conditions. Any unrealized profit or loss on debt instruments classified as FVOCI is reflected in other comprehensive income and is recycled through the profit and loss account when the investment is sold.
- FVTPL: This includes financial assets:
- a. which do not have a fixed maturity; or
- b. which are not classified as either at amortised cost or at FVOCI.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

# Subsequent Measurement

# Equity and debt securities classified as FVTPL

These securities, other than unlisted equity securities, are subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these securities are taken to the profit and loss account.

Changes in the value of unlisted equity securities, carried at the lower of cost or breakup value, are taken to the profit and loss account.

# Equity and debt securities classified as FVOCI

These securities, other than unlisted equity securities, are subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in OCI. When a debt security is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to the profit and loss account. When an equity security is derecognised, gains and losses previously recognised in OCI are not recycled through the profit and loss account but are transferred directly to retained earnings.

Changes in the value of unlisted equity securities, carried out at the lower of cost or breakup value, are recorded in OCI. When these are derecognised, gains and losses are not recycled through the profit and loss account but are transferred directly to retained earnings.

# Other financial assets classified at amortised cost

Other financial assets initially classified at amortised cost continue to be subsequently measured at amortised cost.

# 3.1.2 Classification of Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified at FVTPL, when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value.

Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method.

# 3.1.3 Impairment

An ECL provision will be calculated on financial assets designated at FVOCI or at Amortised cost in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9 and the guidelines issued by the SBP. Credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of the ECL Framework.

Equity securities are not subject to impairment.

# 3.1.4 Transitional Impact

The Bank has elected to follow the modified retrospective approach for restatement i.e. comparative figures have not been restated on the initial application of IFRS 9. Instead, the cumulative impact has been recorded as an adjustment to equity as of January 01, 2024. Accordingly, the information presented as of December 31, 2023 and for the period ended June 30, 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9.

# The following table reconciles the original measurement and carrying amounts of financial instruments in accordance with the previous financial reporting framework with the new measurement categories for the Group.

# 3.2 Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance

The measurement of the ECL allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and at FVOCI is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behavior. A number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such as:

- Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL;
- Establishing groups of similar financial assets for the purpose of measuring ECL;
- Establishing the number and relative weightages of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios for each segment; and
- Determining whether an asset shows a significant increase in credit risk.

# 3.3 Reconciliation of retained earnings and surplus on revaluation of investments

The impact of the transition to IFRS 9 on the retained earnings and the surplus on revaluation of investments as at January 01, 2024 is as follows:

|Retained earnings|(Rupees in '000)|
|---|---|
|Closing balance as at December 31, 2023 - as reported|221,883,756|
|IFRS 9 ECL - attributable to equity holders of the Bank|(28,437,365)|

# 34. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair values of traded investments are based on quoted market prices. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term advances, fixed term deposits and borrowings, other assets and other liabilities, cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments and therefore, are not reported as part of this disclosure. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings, are frequently repriced.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements are categorised within the following fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:

- Level 1 - Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 - Fair value measurements using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the assets or liabilities either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 - Fair value measurements using inputs that are not based on observable market data.

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

# FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within Level 2 and Level 3

Federal Government securities The fair values of Federal Government securities are determined on the basis of rates/ prices sourced from Reuters.

Non-Government debt securities Non-Government debt securities denominated in Rupees are valued on the basis of rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP). Non-Government debt securities denominated in other currencies are valued on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg / Reuters.

Foreign Government debt securities The fair values of foreign Government debt securities are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg / Reuters.

Units of mutual funds The fair values of units of mutual funds are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of each business day.

Derivatives The Group enters into derivatives contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques based on market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.

Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.

Property and equipment and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity, required for Level 3 assets, has not been presented in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

# 34.1 Fair value of financial assets

The following table provides the fair values of those of the Group’s financial assets that are recognised or disclosed at fair value in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements:

# Directors’ Review

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the Unconsolidated Financial Statements for the half-year ended June 30, 2024.

# Macroeconomic Review

After the severe headwinds of FY’23, the economy underwent broad-based stabilization in FY’24 – moderate recovery in GDP growth, improved confidence, easing external pressures, contained twin deficits and receding inflation. Provisional estimates indicate that Pakistan’s GDP grew by 2.4% in FY’24 versus a contraction witnessed in the previous year; led by a robust 6.3% growth in agriculture and a 1.2% recovery in industrial activity. The Large Scale Manufacturing Index exhibited a growth of 0.9% in FY’24 which, while muted, was a considerable improvement over the 10.3% decline in FY’23.

Inflation has been on a downtrend since the start of the year, falling from 29.7% in Dec’23 to 12.6% in Jun’24. Average inflation for FY’24 was 23.4%, at the lower end of SBP’s forecast of 23-25% and significantly lower than the 29.2% in FY’23. The deceleration in inflation has been supported by a proactive monetary policy, improved agricultural output, fiscal consolidation and a stable currency, along with a sharp decline in food prices in H2FY’24. The trajectory has continued into FY’25, with the Jul’24 reading clocking in at 11.1%.

Pakistan’s current account recorded a $0.7 billion deficit in FY’24, the lowest in 13 years, and a nearly 80% reduction from FY’23, reflecting improvements in the trade balance and remittances. Imports remained static, increasing by 0.9% as higher imports of machinery were offset by lower petroleum imports; exports grew by 11.6%, as improved crop production boosted food exports. The trade deficit for FY’24 thus narrowed by 11%, to $22.1 billion. Remittances hit an all-time high of $3.2 billion in May’24 on account of Eid-related inflows and were up 10.7% to $30.3 billion in FY’24, a sharp reversal from the 12.6% decline in FY’23.

FX reserves at end-Jun’24 reached a 24-month high of $9.4 billion as Pakistan successfully concluded the second review under the Standby Arrangement (SBA) and received a $1.1 billion IMF tranche during the quarter. The SBA unlocked additional bilateral funding which, along with inflows from multilateral agencies helped boost reserves despite debt repayments of nearly $9.4 billion during FY’24. The external account stability has led to a rally in Pakistan’s sovereign bonds with yields for the Sep’25 maturity declining to 11% as of Jul’24 versus 40% at the start of FY’24. Reserve stability has also led to a gradual strengthening of the Rupee, which improved by 1.3% in H1’24 to Rs 278.3/$.

Pakistan’s fiscal deficit for FY’24 declined to 6.8% of GDP, from 7.7% in FY’23. More importantly, a primary surplus of 0.9% of GDP was recorded, the first surplus in 20 years. Tax collection increased by 30% to Rs 9.3 trillion; spending rose by 27%, mainly driven by current expenditure and a 43% rise in debt servicing, with only a meagre growth in the PSDP. The Federal Budget for FY’25 targets a primary surplus of 2.0% of GDP, placing an emphasis on mobilizing additional revenue. Tax collection is budgeted to rise by 39% to Rs 13.0 trillion in FY’25, with the growth expected mainly from GST and income tax. In line with IMF pre-conditions, some measures have been taken to reduce exemptions; however, as usual, little has been done to expand the tax base with most of the income tax burden falling unfairly on existing taxpayers.

The equity market has seen a sustained bull run throughout 2024, setting new records and outperforming even the most optimistic projections; the KSE Index crossed the 80,000 mark in July, before a slight recent correction. During FY’24, stocks yielded a 21-year high return of 89%; in USD terms, the return was 94%, making the PSX the world’s best performing market. Sentiments have remained strong, buoyed by currency stability, cheap valuations and expectations of lower interest rates, as well as a resumption of foreign inflows.

The SBP, after holding the status quo since June 2023, started a monetary easing cycle, cutting rates in consecutive meetings, totaling 250bps, to 19.5% in July 2024. The MPC highlighted that an improvement in the external position, a steady and continued decline in inflation and significantly positive real rates provided enough room to reduce the Policy rate in a calibrated manner to support economic activity. However, they cautioned that upside risks to inflation remained from fiscal slippages and future energy price adjustments. Private sector credit has remained stagnant throughout the year. Industry advances improved slightly by 0.7% from Dec’23 levels while deposits increased by 11.8% during the same period. During H1’24, banking spreads have declined by 35bps compared to H1’23.

# Financial Performance

HBL has delivered a unconsolidated profit before tax of Rs 57.9 billion for H1’24, growing by 9% over the same period last year. All businesses continued to perform strongly, with the turnaround now embedded in the international franchise. The Bank’s profit after tax rose by 3% to Rs 28.7 billion, while earnings per share improved from Rs 18.89 in H1’23 to Rs 19.53 in H1’24.

The Bank’s balance sheet grew 13% to Rs 5.9 trillion with total deposits growing by Rs 714 billion over Dec’23 to Rs 4.6 trillion. Domestic deposits increased by 20%, crossing a landmark Rs 4 trillion; this was well ahead of market growth of 11.8%, increasing market share to 13.3%. The growth was primarily in CASA deposits, with the mix improving from 85.8%.
---
in Dec’23 to 87.0% in Jun’24. Although private sector credit demand has remained restrained in 2024, domestic advances improved by 2.2% from the Mar’24 trough, increasing to Rs 1.35 trillion; all business have begun to show an uptick, with HBL’s total advances at Rs 1.6 trillion.

Average domestic deposits increased by Rs 550 billion, driving a 16% growth in the balance sheet, to Rs 4.3 trillion. With falling inflation raising expectations of a rate cut, market rates dipped, and for a period were even below the minimum deposit rate; spreads thus compressed sharply. Nevertheless, volume growth led to a 6% rise in domestic net interest income over H1’23. This was complemented by consistent growth in the international business, supported by elevated interest margins; the Bank’s total net interest income for H1’24 thus increased by 7% over the same period last year, to Rs 112.9 billion. HBL continued its dominance in fees, growing by 22% to Rs 21.3 billion for H1’24. As always, the flagship Cards franchise posted stellar results, delivering more than 45% of the fee growth; branch banking also returned a strong fee performance. Total non-fund income increased by 37% to Rs 35.0 billion with total revenue rising by 13%, to Rs 147.9 billion.

Continued high inflation for the first half of the year has increased administrative expenses by 15.5% over H1’23 to Rs 82.0 billion, trends that are in line with the industry. However, proactive cost management efforts enabled HBL to reduce expenses over the previous quarter. Consequently, the cost/income ratio reduced from 56.1% in Q1’24 to 54.8% in Q2’24.

An increase in non-performing loans along with a flattish loan book have induced an uptick in the infection ratio over the previous quarter, to 5.9%. As a result of prudent provisioning, the specific coverage has increased from 85% in Dec’23 to 92% in Jun’24; the total coverage remains above 100%.

# Capital Ratios

Internal capital generated by the strong results further strengthened HBL’s capital ratios during the period while also enabling a better dividend payout. The Unconsolidated Tier 1 CAR increased from 13.44% in Dec’23 to 13.54% in Jun’24, while total CAR increased from 17.28% to 17.44% over the same period.

# Credit Ratings

During the quarter, the Bank’s credit ratings were re-affirmed by VIS Credit Rating Company Ltd at AAA/A-1+ for long term and short term respectively. The ratings of its TFCs issued as Additional Tier 1 Capital have also been reaffirmed as AA+. The Outlook on all ratings is Stable. The ratings incorporate HBL’s position as the largest commercial bank in the country, its strong franchise and diversified operations, and reflect its robust liquidity with a diversified depositor base, sound asset quality and systemic importance.

# Dividend

The Board of Directors, in its meeting held on August 26, 2024, has declared an interim cash dividend of Rs 4.0 per share (40%) for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

# Future Outlook

Despite a significant improvement in the macroeconomic back-drop over the course of the year, the country’s myriad structural weaknesses – including a narrow tax base, limited private investment, and distortions in the energy chain – are
---
yet to be resolved. The previous SBA and the conclusion of negotiations on a 37-month, $7.0 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) have lowered the risk of policy slippages. However, lapses in the reform agenda cannot be ruled out in the currently fraught political environment. It appears that the Government has made adherence to the IMF stipulations a cornerstone of their economic policy. However, the recent electricity relief package in the Punjab flies in the face of IMF recommendations and it remains to be seen how this plays out.

While the Staff Level Agreement was celebrated with much fanfare in July, the EFF is yet to be approved by the IMF Board, and the initial euphoria has been tempered by the delays in getting this on to the Board’s agenda. The EFF is crucial given the substantial external financing needs over the next five years; while FX reserves are far healthier than in previous years, they remain at less than two months of import cover. IMF Board approval should spur further easing of credit conditions, and international ratings should improve, following Fitch’s upgrade in July. This should help in facilitating access to international funding, which has been scarce in the last two years.

Inflationary pressures have cooled, and we expect CPI to average 11%-12% in FY’25. After the strong growth in FY’24, agriculture is expected to slow; this should be compensated by stronger industrial and services growth on the back of lower rates and higher development spending with real GDP growth rising slightly, to 2.5% – 3.0%. The SBP is expected to maintain a prudent monetary policy, keeping real interest rates significantly positive. The USD/PKR parity will be supported by a benign current account as well as continued controls on capital flight.

The macro-stabilization efforts underway, however, have had a deleterious effect on the real economy, with demand for industrial and service goods slumping over the course of the last two years; a demand recovery will be gradual, at best, over FY’25. Elevated external financing needs and the revenue-driven budget will keep economic growth below its potential in the medium-term. To break this cycle and create the much-needed fiscal space to support growth, the government urgently needs to undertake structural reforms as agreed with the IMF – i) accelerating privatization of SOEs ii) decisive energy sector reforms iii) enhancing export competitiveness and iv) widening the tax base rather than taxing the already-taxed.

Despite the numerous headwinds, HBL continues to deliver improved results, expanding financial access to customers. We continue to dominate the thought leadership space, supporting the Government in every sphere, from renewable energy to cybersecurity awareness. After having helped Pakistan exit the FATF grey list, we are now helping to ensure that these actions are embedded in our institutions and policies. HBL’s digital journey continues to make strides; across all businesses, volumes are growing at an accelerated pace. Over 4.2 million users of HBL Mobile and Internet Banking transacted Rs 3.5 trillion in the first half of 2024 while Konnect volumes crossed a milestone of Rs 0.5 trillion. Konnect is a pivotal player in the growth of Pakistan’s eSports ecosystem and recently held its third “Aur Khelo” tournament, actively fostering a vibrant sports gaming community. HBL’s commitment to ESG principles is well established; recently we have started to eliminate all single-use plastic from our premises. To foster an inclusive and respectful workplace, HBL has dedicated programs for differently-abled people, an initiative that is championed from the top. Employee volunteerism is part of our ethos – from blood camps to tree plantation drives to helping the less privileged, HBL’s employees spent more than 2,000 hours of their personal time to create a better and brighter Pakistan for all.

# Appreciation and Acknowledgement

On behalf of the Board and management, we would like to place on record our appreciation for the efforts of our regulators and the Government of Pakistan, in particular the State Bank of Pakistan, the Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan. In these challenging times, they have stepped up with policies and measures that are prudent, proactive and balanced, protecting the economy, customers and people of Pakistan, while also safeguarding the integrity and soundness of the banking and financial services industry.

We are indebted to our customers, many of whom have banked with us for generations, and who continue to entrust us with their business and confidence. Our shareholders have provided steadfast support and to them, and to all our stakeholders, we are deeply grateful. The Board and the management remain committed to maintaining the highest standards of governance and we assure our stakeholders that we will be industry leaders in this area.

Lastly, but certainly not the least, we express our deepest appreciation and gratitude to our employees and their families, especially in customer facing units and branches, who continually go the extra mile, even at personal cost, to ensure that our customers are able to meet their critical needs. They are our heroes and heroines and we salute them for their dedication and tireless efforts.

On behalf of the Board

# Independent Auditor’s Review Report

To the members of Habib Bank Limited

# Report on review of Condensed Interim Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying condensed interim unconsolidated statement of financial position of Habib Bank Limited (‘the Bank”) as at 30 June 2024 and the related condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit or loss, condensed interim unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, condensed interim unconsolidated statement of changes in equity, and condensed interim unconsolidated statement of cash flows, and notes to the condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements for the six-month period then ended (here-in-after referred to as the “interim financial statements”). Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements based on our review.

# Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”. A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

# Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

# Other Matter

The figures for the quarter ended 30 June 2024 in the condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit or loss and condensed interim unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income have not been reviewed and we do not express a conclusion on them.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor’s review report is Amyn Pirani.

# FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

# 2.3 New standards and amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become effective in the current year

As directed by SBP via BPRD Circular letter no. 7 of 2023 IFRS 9, Financial Instruments is effective in Pakistan for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. IFRS 9 has been applicable in several overseas jurisdictions at various effective dates starting from January 1, 2018. The requirements of this standard are already incorporated in the Bank’s financial statements for the jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted. The results of those overseas operations where IFRS 9 is not applicable will be directly incorporated in the Bank’s financial statements as per the respective host country's regulations, for the year ending December 31, 2024.

SBP via BPRD circular letter no 16 of 2024 has extended the timeline for compliance with the following requirements of IFRS 9 to accounting periods beginning October 01, 2024:

- a- Recognition of interest income / expense under the effective interest rate method;
- b- Measurement of staff loans at fair value;
- c- Accounting for modified loans.

Additionally, the same circular allows banks to continue measuring unlisted equity securities at the lower of cost or breakup value up to December 31, 2024.

Except for the implementation of IFRS 9 in Pakistan, as discussed in note 3.1, the Bank expects that amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards will not affect its financial statements in the period of initial application.

# 2.4 Amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective

There are various standards and amendments to accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan that are not yet effective. Except for the relaxations given by SBP as mentioned in note 2.3 above, these are not likely to have a material effect on the Bank’s financial statements.

# 2.5 Critical accounting estimates and judgements

The basis for accounting estimates adopted in the preparation of these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements is the same as that applied in the preparation of the unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for changes as discussed in note 3.2.

# 3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

Except as disclosed in note 3.1, the material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 3.1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

The key changes to the Bank’s accounting policies resulting from its adoption of IFRS 9 are summarized below:

# 3.1.1 Classification of Financial Assets

The Bank classifies its financial assets, other than its investments in subsidiaries and associates, into the following categories:

- - at Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL);
- - at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI);
- - at Amortised Cost.

# Classification of Equity Instruments

Equity securities that are traded in an active market and are held for trading purposes will be classified as FVTPL. Equity securities that are not held for trading purposes will be classified as FVOCI; however, gains and losses realised on disposal of securities classified as FVOCI will not be recycled through the profit and loss account. The classification decision is made on a case by case basis at the time of purchase, is documented, and is irrevocable.

# Classification of other Financial Assets

Financial Assets other than equity will be classified based on their cash flow characteristics and business model assessment:

- - Amortised Cost: These will be classified as amortised cost if the objective is to hold the asset only for collecting contractual cash flows (principal and interest).
---
# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

# FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

For the six months ended June 30, 2024

- FVOCI: These will be classified at FVOCI when the objective is to collect contractual cash flows (principal and interest) and also to potentially sell the same depending on market conditions. Any unrealized profit or loss on debt instruments classified as FVOCI is reflected in other comprehensive income and is recycled through the profit and loss account when the investment is sold.
- FVTPL: This includes financial assets:
- a. which do not have fixed maturity; or
- b. which are not classified as either at amortised cost or at FVOCI.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

# Subsequent Measurement

# Equity and debt securities classified as FVTPL

These securities, other than unlisted equity securities, are subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these securities are taken to the profit and loss account. Changes in the value of unlisted equity securities, carried at lower of cost or breakup value are taken to the profit and loss account.

# Equity and debt securities classified as FVOCI

These securities, other than unlisted equity securities, are subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in OCI. When a debt security is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to the profit and loss account. When an equity security is derecognised, gains and losses previously recognised in OCI are not recycled through the profit and loss account but are transferred directly to retained earnings. Changes in the value of unlisted equity securities, carried out at lower of cost or breakup value, are recorded in OCI. When these are derecognised, gains and losses are not recycled through the profit and loss account but are transferred directly to retained earnings.

# Other financial assets classified at amortised cost

Other financial assets initially classified at amortised cost continue to be subsequently measured at amortised cost.

# 3.1.2 Classification of Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified at FVTPL, when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method.

# 3.1.3 Impairment

An ECL provision will be calculated on financial assets designated at FVOCI or at Amortised cost in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9 and the guidelines issued by the SBP. Credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of the ECL Framework. Equity securities are not subject to impairment.

# 3.1.4 Transitional Impact

The Bank has elected to follow the modified retrospective approach for restatement i.e. comparative figures have not been restated on the initial application of IFRS 9. Instead, the cumulative impact has been recorded as an adjustment to equity as of January 01, 2024. Accordingly, the information presented as of December 31, 2023 and for the period ended June 30, 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9.

# The following table reconciles the original measurement and carrying amounts of financial instruments in accordance with the previous financial reporting framework with the new measurement categories for the Bank.

# 3.2 Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance

The measurement of the ECL allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and at FVOCI is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behavior. A number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such as:

- Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL;
- Establishing groups of similar financial assets for the purpose of measuring ECL;
- Establishing the number and relative weightages of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios for each segment; and
- Determining whether an asset shows a significant increase in credit risk.

# 3.3 Reconciliation of retained earnings and surplus on revaluation of investments

The impact of transition to IFRS 9 on the retained earnings and the surplus on revaluation of investments as at January 01, 2024 is as follows:

|Retained earnings|(Rupees in '000)|

| |The fair values of traded investments are based on quoted market prices.| | | | |
| |The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term advances, fixed term deposits and borrowings, other assets and other liabilities, cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments and therefore, are not reported as part of this disclosure.| | | | |
| |In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings, are frequently repriced.| | | | |

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

# FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

For the six months ended June 30, 2024

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements are categorised within the following fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

- Level 1 - Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 - Fair value measurements using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 - Fair value measurements using inputs that are not based on observable market data.

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within Level 2 and Level 3

|Federal Government securities|The fair values of Federal Government securities are determined on the basis of rates / prices sourced from Reuters.|
|---|---|
|Non-Government debt securities|Non-Government debt securities denominated in Rupees are valued on the basis of rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP). Non-Government debt securities denominated in other currencies are valued on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg / Reuters.|
|Foreign Government debt securities|The fair values of Foreign Government debt securities are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg / Reuters.|
|Units of mutual funds|The fair values of investments in units of mutual funds are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of each business day.|
|Derivatives|The Bank enters into derivatives contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques based on market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions|The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.|
|Property and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity, required for Level 3 assets, has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.|
