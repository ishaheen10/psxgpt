# DIRECTORS’ REVIEW

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Habib Metropolitan Bank, I am pleased to present the condensed interim un-audited financial statements for the half year ended 30 June 2024.

During the first six months of 2024, Pakistan's economic and financial position continued to improve steadily on the back of resumption of funding from multilateral and bilateral partners and prudent policy decisions. Rupee remained stable throughout the period, averaging under Rs. 279/USD. Pakistan successfully concluded the Nine months Stand by Agreement which laid the foundation for long term EFF program of $7.0 billion for which Staff level agreement has been reached.

The SBP reduced the policy rate by 150 bps in June and further 100 bps in July to 19.5 percent from 22.0 percent. SBP expects inflation numbers to decline significantly and period average reading to fall in 11.5 - 13.5 percent range in FY25 as compared to 23.4 percent in FY24. The expected medium term inflation target is 5 - 7 percent.

Real GDP growth is expected to remain within 2.5 - 3.5 percent range in FY25. Manufacturing activity is muted due to the contractionary measures. Auto and Petroleum Products Excluding Furnace Oil sales and fertilizer offtake increased on MoM basis in June. Large-scale manufacturing also recorded a sharp improvement in May 2024, mainly driven by the apparel sector. The growth in agriculture sector, after showing a strong performance in FY24, is expected to slow down in this fiscal year.

After recording surpluses for three consecutive months, the current account posted a deficit from May onwards as per the expectation. These deficits were largely due to higher dividend and profit payments and a seasonal increase in imports, which more than offset a significant increase in exports and workers' remittances. Cumulatively, the current account deficit in FY24 decreased significantly to 0.2 percent of GDP from 1.0 percent in the preceding year. Looking ahead, the SBP expects a modest increase in imports, in line with the growth outlook. At the same time, the continued robust growth in workers' remittances, along with an increase in exports, is expected to contain the current account deficit in the range of 0 - 1.0 percent of GDP in FY25.

The banking sector's deposit base amounted to Rs. 31.1 trillion as of June 30, 2024, posting a growth by 11.8 percent from Dec 31, 2023, meanwhile advances grew by 0.7 percent during six months to close at Rs. 12.4 trillion. Investments increased by 19.3 percent in same period and stood at Rs. 30.2 trillion.

By the Grace of Allah, HABIBMETRO sustained the growth that was achieved last year, posting a profit before tax of Rs. 22,136 million for the first half of 2024. This translate into after tax earnings of Rs. 10.97 per share.

The Bank's net mark-up / interest income amounted to Rs. 30,468 million compared to Rs. 30,833 million in the same period last year, whereas non-mark-up / interest income increased to Rs. 9,405 million, posting a growth of 18.5 percent from prior year.

Investments declined by 5.6 percent to Rs. 873,519 million whereas net advances increased by 5.0 percent to Rs. 432,514 million during the first half of 2024. Meanwhile, deposits increased to Rs. 1,098,768 million compared to Rs. 1,012,303 million as of 31 December 2023, a growth of 8.5 percent.

The Bank's Net Equity stands at Rs. 99,589 million with a capital adequacy level of 17.6 percent.

The Bank maintained its Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) ratings of AA+ for Long Term, and A1+ rating for Short Term. These ratings denote a high credit quality with a low expectation of credit risk, and a strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.

HABIBMETRO operates a network of 545 branches in 218 cities across Pakistan, including 220 Islamic banking branches, and 187 Islamic banking windows. The Bank provides a comprehensive spectrum of banking services and products including specialized trade finance products and digital banking solutions such as secured mobile, web & SMS Banking services, globally accepted Visa Cards and a nationwide network of ATMs.

Your Bank is fully committed to fulfil its corporate social responsibilities and continues to make regular contributions to a host of non-profit / social organizations. The Bank also engages its employees in a variety of charitable endeavors and causes, with a major focus on healthcare and education, as part of its efforts to be a socially conscious company.

Your Bank is also accelerating digital transformation by promoting mobile app, web banking and debit cards along with providing the Corporates/ SMEs with the creative employee / transaction banking solutions. Apart from this, your bank is continuously expanding the SIRAT footprint to fulfill the growing Islamic Banking needs of the nation.

In conclusion, we express our sincere gratitude to the Ministry of Finance, the State Bank of Pakistan and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan for their continued support. We also thank our valued shareholders and customers for their trust, the Board of Directors for their guidance and the staff of HABIBMETRO Bank for their dedication, which enables us to grow from strength to strength.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REVIEW REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF HABIB METROPOLITAN BANK LIMITED

# Report on review of Unconsolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements

# Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position of Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited (“the Bank”) as at 30 June 2024 and the related unconsolidated condensed interim profit and loss account, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of changes in equity, unconsolidated condensed interim cash flow statement and notes to the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements for the half year ended 30 June 2024 (here-in-after referred to as the “interim financial statements"). Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements based on our review.

# Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity". A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

# Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

# Other Matter

The figures for the quarter ended 30 June 2024 in the unconsolidated condensed interim profit and loss account and unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income have not been reviewed and we do not express a conclusion on them.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor's review report is Zeeshan Rashid.

The Bank has controlling interest in First Habib Modaraba, HabibMetro Modaraba Management Company, Habib Metropolitan Financial Services Limited and HabibMetro Exchange Services Limited and is required to prepare consolidated financial statements under the provision of Companies Act 2017. These condensed interim financial statements represent the unconsolidated results of the Bank and separate set of condensed interim consolidated financial statements are also being presented by the Bank.

# 2.2 Statement of Compliance

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. The accounting and reporting standards for interim financial reporting comprise of:

- International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP), as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) from time to time.

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of the IFRS or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

The SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment Property' for banking companies through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002 till further instructions. Further, the SECP has deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' on banks through its notification S.R.O 411(I)/2008 dated April 28, 2008. The State Bank of Pakistan through BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2015 dated February 25, 2015 has deferred the applicability of Islamic Financial Accounting Standard for Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits (IFAS-3) issued by the ICAP and notified by the SECP, vide their SRO No. 571 of 2013 dated June 12, 2013 for Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services (IIFS). Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements. The disclosures and presentation made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are based on a format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 2 dated February 09, 2023 and IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. They do not include all the disclosures required for annual financial statements, and these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2023. As per the aforementioned SBP's Circular Letter, the applicability of IFRS - 9 Financial Instruments is effective from January 01, 2024. Accordingly, these financial statements have been prepared to comply with the requirements thereof. Therefore, the requirements of SBP directives that currently provide the accounting framework for the measurement and valuation of investments and provision against non performing financings have been followed till December 31, 2023.

# 2.3 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published approved accounting and reporting standards that are effective in the current period

There are certain new and amended standards, interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any material effect on the Bank's operations except for the implementation of IFRS 9: "Financial Instruments" as detailed in note 3.

# 2.4 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published approved accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any material effect on the Bank's operations and therefore not detailed in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 2.4.1 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to the published accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective

The following revised standards, amendments and interpretations with respect to the accounting and reporting standards would be effective from the dates mentioned below against the respective standards, amendments or interpretations:

|Standards, interpretations of and amendments|Effective date (annual periods beginning on or after)|
|---|---|
|– Amendments to IAS 21- Lack of Exchangeability|1 January 2025|


The above amendments are not expected to have any material impact on the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements of the Bank.

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policies applied in preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those as applied in the preparation of unconsolidated annual financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for the following:

# 3.1 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

During the period, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9: ‘Financial Instruments' (the Standard) became applicable to the Bank. BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 issued by SBP provides detailed instructions on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks. The SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024 has made certain amendments and extended the timelines of IFRS 9 application instructions.

The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘expected credit losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions from January 1, 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at 1 January 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard. Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9. The accounting policies applicable to the 2023 presented information is consistent with the policies mentioned in the annual audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 has made certain amendments and extended timelines of application instructions for certain areas where the banking industry has sought more time. These amendments and relaxations include use modification accounting for financial assets and liabilities as per the standard and recording and treatment of staff loan and advances given at reduced rates with effect from 1 October 2024, this in turn also effects the reduced rate loans and modified assets accounting. Moreover, SBP has allowed an extension to Banks up to December 31, 2024 for developing the requisite models for calculating EAD for revolving products beyond the contractual date. In addition the banks have also been allowed to continue existing practice of valuing unquoted equity investment at their cost or breakup value, whichever is lower, till 31 December 2024 and perform fair valuation of these securities afterwards.

# 3.1.2 Impact on regulatory capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the Banks, which has reduced their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the 'Application Instructions' issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement.

The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the “transitional adjustment amount”) must be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the “transition period” of five years. However, the Bank has not adopted for the transitional arrangement.

Moreover, SBP has allowed to adjust the amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions in Tier 2 Capital that have not been added back to CET 1 and vice versa as per Annexure-A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024. Had IFRS 9 not been applied then CAR would have been higher by 8 bps from 18.19 % to 18.27%.

# 3.1.3 Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) regardless of the business model in which they are held.

# Recognition and initial measurement

Trade receivable and debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at transaction price.

# Classification of Financial Assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL. A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI. A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Bank changes its business models for managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following changes in the business model.

IFRS 9 allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any 'accounting mismatch' that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different basis. SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout the life of the instrument. Nonetheless, banks should avoid this option for financial instruments that are categorized as Level 3 in terms of the IFRS 13 hierarchy.

# 3.1.4 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either Held to collect, Held to collect and sale and Others based on Business model assessment. The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The assessment requires judgement based on facts and circumstances on the date of assessment. The information considered mainly includes:

- the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual markup revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Bank’s management;
- the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and its strategy for how those risks are managed;
- how managers of the business are compensated (e.g., whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected); and
- the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking “worst case” or “stress case” scenarios into account.

Transfer of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Bank continuing recognition of the financial assets.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

# 3.1.5 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as interest margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Bank considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Bank considers:

- contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
- leverage features;
- prepayment and extension terms;
- terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and
- features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).

A prepayment feature is consistent with the SPPI criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and markup on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract.

Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.

The Bank holds a portfolio of long-term fixed-rate loan for which the Bank has the option to propose to revise the interest rate at periodic reset dates. These reset rights are limited to the market rate at the time of revision. The borrowers have an option to either accept the revised rate or redeem the financing at par without penalty. The Bank has determined that the contractual cash flows of these loans are SPPI because the option varies the interest rate in a way that is consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic financing risks and costs associated with the principal amount outstanding.

# 3.1.6 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

# Financial assets at FVTPL

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any markup or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.

# Financial assets at amortised cost

These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Markup, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.

# Debt investments at FVOCI

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and is assessed for impairment under the new ECL model. Markup income is calculated using the effective interest method and includes amortisation of premiums and accretion of discount, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit and loss account. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to income statement.

# Equity investments at FVOCI

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are adjusted from the carrying value of investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit and loss account.

# 3.1.7 Amortised cost and gross carrying amount

The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance (or impairment allowance before 1 January 2024).

The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

# 3.1.8 Calculation of markup income and expense

Markup income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:

- the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or
- the amortised cost of the financial liability.

The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability.

In calculating markup income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, markup income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of markup income reverts to the gross basis.

For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, markup income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of markup income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves.

# 3.1.9 Derecognition

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between:

1. the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and
2. the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI shall be recognised in profit or loss.

From 1 January 2024 any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI is not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any markup in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Bank is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its statement of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or a portion of them. In such cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised. Examples of such transactions are securities lending and sale-and-repurchase transactions.

When assets are sold to a third party with a concurrent total rate of return swap on the transferred assets, the transaction is accounted for as a secured loan transaction similar to sale-and-repurchase transactions, because the Bank retains all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of such assets.

In transactions in which the Bank neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Bank continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.

In certain transactions, the Bank retains the obligation to service the transferred financial asset for a fee. The transferred asset is derecognised if it meets the derecognition criteria. An asset or liability is recognised for the servicing contract if the servicing fee is more than adequate (asset) or is less than adequate (liability) for performing the servicing.

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified.

# 3.1.10 Modification

# Financial assets

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of loans to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification are accounted for as follows:

- fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and
- other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.

If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the bank first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognises the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred, and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset. If such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as markup income calculated using the effective interest rate method.

# Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability recognised and consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. Consideration paid includes non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability.

If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. For floating-rate financial liabilities, the original effective interest rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is

# 3.1.11 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’).

# Measurement of ECL

ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:

- financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive);
- financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows;
- undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive; and
- financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Bank expects to recover.

# Restructured financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows:

- If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset.
- If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in ‘Stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘Stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘Stage 3’.

# Non-Performing financial assets

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit-impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘non-performing’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- the restructuring of a loan by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.

Under the IFRS 9 Application instructions, the Bank is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. The Bank calculates the ECL against corporate, commercial & SME loan portfolios as higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at borrower/facility level, whereas against the retail borrowers the Bank will calculate ECL at higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at segment/product basis as instructed under Annexure-A of BPRD Circular letter no 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024.

Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 and Application Instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

- Probability of Default (PD): The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12-month ECL, Stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2). PD is estimated using internal rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk rating. The bank has used Transition Matrix approach for estimation of PD for each internal rating. The bank has used roll-rate method using the days past due (DPD) criteria to estimate PD for its retail portfolio. PD are then adjusted with forward looking information for calculation of ECL.
- Exposure at Default (EAD): The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant. The Bank estimates EAD for financial assets carried at an amortised cost equal to principal plus profit. Each repayment date is assumed to be default point in the model and the ECL is calculated on EAD at each reporting date and discounted at the effective interest rate. Further, cash and cash equivalent collaterals that the Bank holds against the non-retail facilities are adjusted from the EAD.
- Loss Given Default (LGD): An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral.

# 3.1.12 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include watchlist and Restructuring / Rescheduling (R&R) customers. If a customer is tagged watchlist or restructured, would be moved into Stage-2.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PR issued by SBP. Financial assets in stage 2 may be reclassified to stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum period of 06 months from initial downgrade is required before any facility is moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to move back from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it should meet the criteria defined under the respective Prudential Regulations for de-classification of account / facility. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially and complete the cooling off period of 06 months before moving into Stage 1.

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022. The Bank has used the rebuttable presumption for trade loans where SBP has directed to take the customer directly into loss after the 180 days, such loans would transferred into Stage 2 upon 120 DPDs except where obligor has 100% cash coverage would remain in Stage 1.

# 3.1.13 Write-offs

Financial assets are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level.

Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in the statement of profit or loss and OCI.

Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Bank’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

# 3.1.14 Off-setting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

# 3.1.15 Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank has adopted a governance framework requiring the Risk, Finance, Operations, Internal Audit and IT functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. IFRS 9 requires robust credit risk models that can predict Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD).

The Bank’s Risk Management Division has developed Models/ methodologies for PD, LGD and Credit Conversion Factors (CCF). These models are validated on annual basis considering the following aspects:

- Quantitative Validation: Expected credit loss (ECL) model design validation, data quality validation and benchmarking with external best practices.
- Quantitative Validation: Calibration testing which ensures the accuracy of the observed PDs.

The Risk Department defines the staging criteria for the new impairment model and take ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach. Additionally, the Risk department also take the ownership of the impact of ECL on bank's capital.

Risk Management division of the Bank is responsible for the implementation of IFRS 9. Further the Bank has engaged a consultant for the calculation of ECL on a quarterly basis. The same is provided to the Risk Management Division which reviews and assesses the ECL and submits to the same to Finance Division for financial reporting requirements.

Finance Division then uses the financial information for preparing the financial statements and related financial ratios.

Risk Management Division prepares and submits the analysis to board risk committee on a quarterly basis. Further financial statements prepared on the basis of IFRS-9 is then submitted to the Board Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.

The IT Department is responsible to identify, prepare and extract the data required for the risk parameters modelling and ECL calculations. IT department also support project owners for system development and upgrades.

# 3.2 Revised format of unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements

The SBP through its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 9, 2023, and BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, has amended the format of quarterly and half yearly financial statements of banks. All banks are directed to prepare their quarterly and half yearly financial statements on the revised format effective from accounting year starting from January 1, 2024. Accordingly, the Bank has prepared these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements on the new format prescribed by the SBP.

The adoption of revised format has resulted in following significant changes:

- Right-of-use-assets (note 13) amounting to Rs 8,124,139 (December 31, 2023: Rs 7,601,453) which were previously shown as part of fixed assets are now shown separately on the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position.
- Lease liabilities (note 20) amounting to Rs 9,727,131 (December 31, 2023: Rs 9,051,378) which were previously shown as part of other liabilities (note 21) are now shown separately on the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position.

# 4. BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain property and equipment and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims which are stated at revalued amounts; certain investments and derivative contracts which have been marked to market and are carried at fair value, obligation in respect of staff retirement benefits and lease liability which have been carried at present value and right of use of assets which are initially measured at an amount equal to corresponding lease liabilities (adjusted for any lease payment and costs) and depreciated over respective lease term.

# 5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The basis for accounting estimates adopted in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are the same as that applied in the preparation of the unconsolidated audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, except for measurement of the expected credit loss allowance.

# 6. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The financial risk management policies adopted by the bank are consistent with those disclosed in the unconsolidated audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.

# 21.2 Workers' Welfare Fund

Under the Workers' Welfare Ordinance 1971, the Bank is liable to pay workers' welfare fund (WWF) @ 2% of accounting profit before tax or taxable income, whichever is higher. The Bank has made full provision for WWF based on profit for the respective years.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated 10 November 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of WWF were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending.

Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions the judgement may not currently be treated as conclusive. Accordingly the Bank maintains its provision in respect of WWF.

These mainly represent counter claims by borrowers for damages. Based on legal advice and internal assessments, management is confident that the matters will be decided in the Bank’s favour and the possibility of any adverse outcome is remote. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 23.3.2

While adjudicating foreign exchange repatriation cases of exporters, the Foreign Exchange Adjudicating Court of the State Bank of Pakistan has adjudicated penalty of Rs.106.056 million, arbitrarily on the Bank. The Bank has filed appeals before the Appellate Board and Constitutional Petitions in the Honorable High Court of Sindh against the said judgment. The Honorable High Court has granted relief to the Bank by way of interim orders. Based on merits of the appeals management is confident that these appeals shall be decided in favor of the Bank and therefore no provision has been made against the impugned penalty.

# 24. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Bank deals in derivative financial instruments namely forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps with the principal view of hedging the risks arising from its trade business. As per the Bank’s policy, these contracts are reported on their fair value at the statement of financial position date. The gains and losses from revaluation of these contracts are included under “Foreign exchange income”. Unrealised mark to market gains and losses on these contracts are recorded on the statement of financial position under “other assets / other liabilities”.

These products are offered to the Bank’s customers to protect from unfavorable movements in foreign currencies. The Bank hedges such exposures in the inter-bank foreign exchange market. These positions are reviewed on a regular basis by the Bank’s Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO).

# 35. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than investment in subsidiaries and those classified as held to maturity,
is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortised cost.
The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in subsidiaries, is determined on the basis
of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.
The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits
and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active
market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.
The fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying
values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain
long term borrowings are frequently repriced.

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 2.

Federal government debt securities: The fair value of government securities are valued using PKRV, PKFRV and PKISRV rates.

Debt securities other than federal government securities: The fair value is determined using the prices / rates available on Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) / Reuters.

Forward foreign exchange contracts: The fair values are derived using forward exchange rates applicable to their respective remaining maturities.

Mutual funds: The fair value is determined based on the net asset values published at the close of each business day.

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values of non-financial assets within level 3.

Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claim: Fixed assets and non-banking assets are valued by professionally qualified valuators. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. In determining the valuation for land and building the valuer refers to numerous independent market inquiries from local estate agents / realtors in the vicinity to establish the present market value. The fair valuation of land and building are considered to represent a level 3 valuation based on significant non-observable inputs being the location and condition of the assets. The fair value is subject to change owing to changes in input. However, management does not expect there to be a material sensitivity to the fair value arising from the non-observable inputs.

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# 3.1 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

During the period, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9: ‘Financial Instruments' (the Standard) became applicable to the Group.

BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 issued by SBP provides detailed instructions on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks. The SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024 has made certain amendments and extended the timelines of IFRS 9 application instructions.

The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘expected credit losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Group which are exposed to credit risk.

The Group has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions from January 1, 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at 1 January 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard. Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9. The accounting policies applicable to the 2023 presented information is consistent with the policies mentioned in the annual audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 has made certain amendments and extended timelines of application instructions for certain areas where the banking industry has sought more time. These amendments and relaxations include use modification accounting for financial assets and liabilities as per the standard and recording and treatment of staff loan and advances given at reduced rates with effect from 1 October 2024, this in turn also effects the reduced rate loans and modified assets accounting.

Moreover, SBP has allowed an extension to Banks up to December 31, 2024 for developing the requisite models for calculating EAD for revolving products beyond the contractual date. In addition the banks have also been allowed to continue existing practice of valuing unquoted equity investment at their cost or breakup value, whichever is lower, till 31 December 2024 and perform fair valuation of these securities afterwards.

# 3.1.2 Impact on regulatory capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the Banks, which has reduced their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the 'Application Instructions' issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement.

The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the “transitional adjustment amount”) must be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the “transition period” of five years. However, the Group has not adopted for the transitional arrangement.

Moreover, SBP has allowed to adjust the amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions in Tier 2 Capital that have not been added back to CET 1 and vice versa as per Annexure-A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024. Had IFRS 9 not been applied then CAR would have been higher by 8 bps from 17.91 % to 17.99%.

# 3.1.3 Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) regardless of the business model in which they are held.

# Recognition and initial measurement

Trade receivable and debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at transaction price.

# Classification of Financial Assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL. A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI. A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business models for managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following changes in the business model.

IFRS 9 allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any 'accounting mismatch' that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different basis. SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout the life of the instrument. Nonetheless, Group should avoid this option for financial instruments that are categorized as Level 3 in terms of the IFRS 13 hierarchy.

# 3.1.4 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either Held to collect, Held to collect and sale and Others based on Business model assessment. The Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The assessment requires judgement based on facts and circumstances on the date of assessment. The information considered mainly includes:

- the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual markup revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group’s management;
- the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and its strategy for how those risks are managed;
- how managers of the business are compensated (e.g., whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected); and
- the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not.

considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Group’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised. The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking “worst case” or “stress case” scenarios into account. Transfer of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Group continuing recognition of the financial assets. Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

# 3.1.5 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as interest margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Group considers:

- contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
- leverage features;
- prepayment and extension terms;
- terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and
- features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).

A prepayment feature is consistent with the SPPI criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and markup on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a discount or premium to its contractual par- amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.

The Group holds a portfolio of long-term fixed-rate loan for which the Group has the option to propose to revise the interest rate at periodic reset dates. These reset rights are limited to the market rate at the time of revision. The borrowers have an option to either accept the revised rate or redeem the financing at par without penalty. The Group has determined that the contractual cash flows of these loans are SPPI because the option varies the interest rate in a

# 3.1.6 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

# Financial assets at FVTPL

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any markup or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.

# Financial assets at amortised cost

These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Markup, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.

# Debt investments at FVOCI

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and is assessed for impairment under the new ECL model. Markup income is calculated using the effective interest rate method and includes amortisation of premiums and accretion of discount, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit and loss account. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to income statement.

# Equity investments at FVOCI

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are adjusted from the carrying value of investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit and loss account.

# 3.1.7 Amortised cost and gross carrying amount

The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest rate method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance (or impairment allowance before 1 January 2024).

The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

# 3.1.8 Calculation of markup income and expense

Markup income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method. The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:

- the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or
- the amortised cost of the financial liability.

The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability.

In calculating markup income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, markup income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of markup income reverts to the gross basis.

For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, markup income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of markup income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves.

# 3.1.8 Presentation

Markup / interest earned as presented in the profit and loss account includes markup income calculated using the effective interest method as presented in sub note which includes:

- markup on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost;
- markup on debt instruments measured at FVOCI

Markup / interest expense as presented in the profit and loss account includes markup expense calculated using the effective interest rate method as presented in sub note which includes financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

Markup income and expense on all trading assets and liabilities are considered to be incidental to the Group’s trading operations and are presented together with all other changes in the fair value of trading assets and liabilities in net trading income.

Markup income and expense on other financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are presented in net income from other financial instruments at FVTPL.

Under IFRS 9 markup income earned on non-performing financial assets is determined by using the credit adjusted effective interest rate. However, in accordance with the application instructions the unrealized markup earned on non-performing assets are kept in a memorandum account and are not credited to the statement of profit and loss. However, the Banks are advised to recognize income on non-performing assets (loans classified under PRs i.e., OAEM and Stage 3 loan) on a receipt basis in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations issued by SBP.

# 3.1.9 Derecognition

The Group derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or
- transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

– the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between:

1. a) the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and
2. b) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI shall be recognised in profit or loss.

From 1 January 2024 any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI is not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any markup in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

The Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its statement of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or a portion of them. In such cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised. Examples of such transactions are securities lending and sale-and-repurchase transactions.

When assets are sold to a third party with a concurrent total rate of return swap on the transferred assets, the transaction is accounted for as a secured loan transaction similar to sale-and repurchase transactions, because the Group retains all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of such assets.

In transactions in which the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.

In certain transactions, the Group retains the obligation to service the transferred financial asset for a fee. The transferred asset is derecognised if it meets the derecognition criteria. An asset or liability is recognised for the servicing contract if the servicing fee is more than adequate (asset) or is less than adequate (liability) for performing the servicing.

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

# 3.1.10 Modification

# Financial assets

The Group sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of loans to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification are accounted for as follows:

– fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and

– other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.

If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the Group plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the Group first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognised the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred, and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

If such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as markup income calculated using the effective interest rate method.

# Financial liabilities

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability recognised and consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. Consideration paid includes non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability.

If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. For floating-rate financial liabilities, the original effective interest rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument.

# 3.1.11 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a

# Measurement of ECL

ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:

- financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive);
- financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows;
- undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Group if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive;
- financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Group expects to recover.

# Restructured financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows:

- If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset.
- If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.

# Stages of Financial Assets

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in ‘Stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘Stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘Stage 3’.

# Non-Performing financial assets

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit-impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘non-performing’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- the restructuring of a loan by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.

Under the IFRS 9 Application instructions, the Group is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. The Group calculates the ECL against corporate, commercial & SME loan portfolios as higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at borrower/facility level, whereas against the retail borrowers the Group will calculate ECL at higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at segment/product basis as instructed under Annexure-A of BPRD Circular letter no 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024.

Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 and Application Instructions, the Group has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12-month ECL, Stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2). PD is estimated using internal rating classes and are based on the Group’s internal risk rating. The Group has used Transition Matrix approach for estimation of PD for each internal rating. The Group has used roll-rate method using the days past due (DPD) criteria to estimate PD for its retail portfolio. PD are then adjusted with forward looking information for calculation of ECL.
- EAD: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant. The Group estimates EAD for financial assets carried at an amortised cost equal to principal plus profit. Each repayment date is assumed to be default point in the model and the ECL is calculated on EAD at each reporting date and discounted at the effective interest rate. Further, cash and cash equivalent collaterals that the Group holds against the non-retail facilities are adjusted from the EAD.
- LGD: An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Group expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

# 3.1.12 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition.

is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Group used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include watchlist and Restructuring / Rescheduling (R&R) customers. If a customer is tagged watchlist or restructured, would be moved into Stage-2.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PR issued by SBP. Financial assets in stage 2 may be reclassified to stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum period of 06 months from initial downgrade is required before any facility is moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to move back from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it should meet the criteria defined under the respective Prudential Regulations for de-classification of account / facility. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially and complete the cooling off period of 06 months before moving into Stage 1.

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022. The Group has used the rebuttable presumption for trade loans where SBP has directed to take the customer directly into loss after the 180 days, such loans would transferred into Stage 2 upon 120 DPDs except where obligor has 100% cash coverage would remain in Stage 1.

# 3.1.13 Write-offs

Financial assets are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level.

Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in the statement of profit or loss and OCI.

Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

# 3.1.14 Off-setting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

# 3.1.15 Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Group has adopted a governance framework requiring the Risk, Finance, Operations, Internal Audit and IT functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. IFRS 9 requires robust credit risk models that can predict Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD).

The Group’s Risk Management Division has developed Models/ methodologies for PD, LGD and Credit Conversion Factors (CCF). These models are validated on annual basis considering the following aspects:

- Quantitative Validation: Expected credit loss (ECL) model design validation, data quality validation and benchmarking with external best practices.
- Quantitative Validation: Calibration testing which ensures the accuracy of the observed PDs.

The Risk Department defines the staging criteria for the new impairment model and take ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach. Additionally, the Risk department also take the ownership of the impact of ECL on Group's capital.

Risk Management division of the Group is responsible for the implementation of IFRS 9. Further the Bank has engaged a consultant for the calculation of ECL on a quarterly basis. The same is provided to the Risk Management Division which reviews and assesses the ECL and submits to the same to Finance Division for financial reporting requirements.

Finance Division then uses the financial information for preparing the financial statements and related financial ratios.

Risk Management Division prepares and submits the analysis to board risk committee on a quarterly basis. Further financial statements prepared on the basis of IFRS-9 is then submitted to the Board Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.

The IT Department is responsible to identify, prepare and extract the data required for the risk parameters modelling and ECL calculations. IT department also support project owners for system development and upgrades.

# 3.2 Revised format of consolidated condensed interim financial statements

The SBP through its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 9, 2023, and BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, has amended the format of quarterly and half yearly financial statements of banks.

All banks are directed to prepare their quarterly and half yearly financial statements on the revised format effective from accounting year starting from January 1, 2024. Accordingly, the Bank has prepared these consolidated condensed interim financial statements on the new format prescribed by the SBP.

The adoption of revised format has resulted in following significant changes:

- Right-of-use-assets (note 13) amounting to Rs 8,150,670 (December 31, 2023: Rs 7,625,010) which were previously shown as part of fixed assets are now shown separately on the consolidated condensed interim statement of financial position.
- Lease liabilities (note 20) amounting to Rs 9,727,131 (December 31, 2023: Rs 9,051,378) which were previously shown as part of other liabilities (note 21) are now shown separately on the consolidated condensed interim statement of financial position.

# 4. BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain property and equipment and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims which are

# CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The basis for accounting estimates adopted in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements are the same as that applied in the preparation of the consolidated audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, except for measurement of the expected credit loss allowance.

# FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The financial risk management policies adopted by the Group are consistent with those disclosed in the consolidated audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.

# 21.2 Workers' Welfare Fund

Under the Workers' Welfare Ordinance 1971, the holding company is liable to pay workers' welfare fund (WWF) @ 2% of accounting profit before tax or taxable income, whichever is higher. The Bank has made full provision for WWF based on profit for the respective years.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated 10 November 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of WWF were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending.

Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions the judgement may not currently be treated as conclusive. Accordingly the Bank maintains its provision in respect of WWF.

The Honorable High Court has granted relief to Bank by way of interim orders. Based on merits of the appeals management is confident that these appeals shall be decided in favor of the Bank and therefore no provision has been made against the impugned penalty.

| |The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.| | | | |
| |The fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings are frequently repriced.| | | | |


# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 2.

Federal government debt securities: The fair value of government securities are valued using PKRV, PKFRV and PKISRV rates.

Debt securities other than federal government securities: The fair value is determined using the prices / rates available on Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) / Reuters.

Forward foreign exchange contracts: The fair values are derived using forward exchange rates applicable to their respective remaining maturities.

Mutual funds: The fair value is determined based on the net asset values published at the close of each business day.

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values of non-financial assets within level 3.

Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claim: Fixed assets and non-banking assets are valued by professionally qualified valuators. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. In determining the valuation for land and building the valuer refers to numerous independent market inquiries from local estate agents / realtors in the vicinity to establish the present market value. The fair valuation of land and building are considered to represent a level 3 valuation based on significant non-observable inputs being the location and condition of the assets. The fair value is subject to change owing to changes in input. However, management does not expect there to be a material sensitivity to the fair value arising from the non-observable inputs.
