# Directors' Review – March 2024

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the financial statements of MCB Bank Limited (MCB) for the three months period ended March 31, 2024.

# Performance Review

Navigating a challenging operating and macroeconomic environment, the Bank has been addressing asset quality issues by maintaining discipline in management of its risk return decisions. Diversification of the loan book across customer segments and a robust credit underwriting framework that encompasses structured assessment models, effective pre-disbursement evaluation tools and an array of post disbursement monitoring systems has enabled MCB to effectively manage its credit risk; the Non-performing loan (NPLs) base of the Bank was reported at Rs. 55.4 billion as at March 31, 2024. The coverage and infection ratios of the Bank were reported at 92.67% and 8.56% respectively.

# Ratings

Pakistan Credit Rating Agency re-affirmed credit ratings of MCB at “AAA / A1+” for long term and short term respectively, through its notification dated June 23, 2023.

# Economy Review

In Pakistan, the economy has shown signs of improvement, with the successful completion of the IMF's Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) program and the implementation of ongoing policy and reform efforts. However, sustaining this recovery will require continued fiscal consolidation, a prudent policy stance, timely and adequate financial inflows to meet gross financing needs, and stability in the external sector.

Headline inflation is on a downward trajectory, decreasing to 23.1% in February 2024 from 31.5% in February 2023. Despite this, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) opted to maintain the policy rate at 22% on March 18, 2024, citing risks to inflation outlook amidst elevated inflation expectations. The SBP had previously raised the average inflation forecast to 23%-25% in the fiscal year ending June 2024, up from the earlier estimate of 20%-22%.

On the fiscal front, the primary surplus increased to Rs 1,939 billion during Jul-Jan FY2024 from Rs 945 billion in the previous year. However, the fiscal deficit expanded to 2.6% of GDP during Jul-Jan FY2024, compared to 2.3% recorded last year.

The current account registered a deficit of USD 508 million for Jul-Mar FY 2024, reflecting an improvement in the trade balance compared to the previous year. In March 2024, the current account posted a surplus of USD 619 million, a positive increase from the surplus of USD 537 million in the same month last year.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows amounted to USD 258 million in March 2024, improving from an inflow of USD 136 million the preceding month. Remittances also exhibited an upward trend, increasing by 16.44% in March 2024 (USD 2.954 billion) compared to March 2023 (USD 2.537 billion).

# Future Outlook

Two key external factors that could impact Pakistan's economic performance in 2024 are global energy prices influenced by geopolitical tensions and climate change. Concerns regarding Pakistan's foreign debt obligations persist, especially given challenges in increasing export earnings and a negative trade balance. Addressing these issues will require crucial support from the IMF's Extended Funding Facility (EFF) and external inflows from friendly nations. However, achieving these objectives will entail rigorous fiscal and monetary adjustments to meet IMF requirements, including reducing gas and power circular debts, adopting a flexible exchange rate, and enhancing tax revenue collection. These adjustments may exert further inflationary pressures and significantly dampen aggregate demand.

# Appreciation and Acknowledgements

The Board of Directors of MCB Bank Limited would like to extend their sincere gratitude towards the Government of Pakistan, the State Bank of Pakistan, the Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan and other regulatory bodies for their continued support and guidance, all shareholders and customers of the Bank for their trust, and our employees for their continuous dedication and commitment.

For and on behalf of the Board of Directors,

April 24, 2024

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

2.1 These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements represent separate financial statements of MCB Bank Limited. The consolidated condensed interim financial statements of the Group are being issued separately.

2.2 In accordance with the directives of the Federal Government regarding the shifting of the banking system to Islamic modes, the State Bank of Pakistan has issued various circulars from time to time. Permissible forms of trade-related modes of financing include purchase of goods by banks from their customers and immediate resale to them at appropriate profit in price on deferred payment basis. The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilized and the appropriate portion of profit thereon.

2.3 The unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are presented in Pak Rupees, which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency of its primary economic environment. The amounts are rounded off to the nearest thousand.

2.4 These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except that certain classes of fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are stated at revalued amounts and certain investments and derivative financial instruments have been marked to market and are carried at fair value. In addition, obligations in respect of staff retirement benefits are carried at present value.

# 3. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

3.1 These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. The accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting comprise of:

- International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, Interim Financial Reporting, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IAS 34 or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives, shall prevail.

3.2 The State Bank of Pakistan has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standards 40, 'Investment Property' for Banking Companies through BSD Circular No. 10 dated August 26, 2002. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has deferred applicability of IFRS 7 "Financial Instruments: Disclosures" on banks through S.R.O 411(1)/2008 dated April 28, 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements. However, investments have been classified and valued in accordance with the requirements prescribed by the State Bank of Pakistan through various circulars.

3.3 The SECP vide its notification SRO 633 (I)/2014 dated 10 July 2014, adopted IFRS 10 effective from the periods starting from June 30, 2014. However, vide its notification SRO 56 (I)/2016 dated January 28, 2016, it has been notified that the requirements of IFRS 10 and section 228 of the Companies Act, 2017 will not be applicable with respect to the investment in mutual funds established under trust structure.

3.4 The disclosures made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on a format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 02 of 2023 dated February 09, 2023 and IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the audited annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the audited annual unconsolidated financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2023.

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements (un-audited)

# For The Three Months Period Ended March 31, 2024

# 3.5 Standards, Interpretations of and Amendments to Approved Accounting Standards That are Effective in the Current Period

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any material effect on the Bank's operations and therefore not detailed in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements except for IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', the impact of which is disclosed under note 4.2.

# The Requirements of IFRS 9 Led to Changes In Classification of Certain Financial Assets Held by the Bank Which are Explained as Follows:

Equity instruments previously classified as available for sale (AFS) The Bank has elected to irrevocably designate all quoted and unquoted equity securities previously classified as available for sale (AFS) as FVOCI except units of open end mutual funds amounting to Rs. 115.98 million classified as FVTPL. The fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities.

# 3.6 Standards, Interpretations of and Amendments to Approved Accounting Standards That are not yet Effective

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any material effect on the Bank's operations and therefore not detailed in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# Debt instruments previously classified as available for sale (AFS)

Debt instruments previously classified as AFS upon passing the SPPI test have been designated as fair value through OCI under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, but also to sell those investment. There is no change to their measurement basis and realized and unrealized gain/loss under IFRS 9.

# Debt instruments previously classified as held to maturity (HTM)

Debt instruments currently classified as HTM upon passing the SPPI test have been designated as amortized cost under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows. There is no change to their measurement basis.

# 4 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The material accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the audited annual unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for changes mentioned in notes 4.1 and 4.2.

# 4.1 Adoption of New Forms for the Preparation of Unconsolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements

The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 09, 2023, issued the revised forms for the preparation of the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements of the Banks. The implementation of the revised forms has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the condensed interim financial statements. Right of use assets and corresponding lease liability are now presented separately on the face of the Statement of financial position. Previously, these were presented under property and equipment (earlier titled as fixed assets) and other liabilities respectively. There is no impact of this change on the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 4.2 Impact of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard introduces a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on an 'Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than the 'incurred credit losses' approach as currently followed. The ECL approach has an impact on all assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

In preparation of these financial statements, the Bank has applied requirements of IFRS 9 and application instructions issued by SBP with the date of initial application of January 01, 2024 with modified retrospective approach for restatement. As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Bank has not restated comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognized in the opening retained earnings and other reserves at the beginning of the current year without restating the comparative figures.

# CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the business model within which they are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’) regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Bank’s business model in which financial assets are held determines whether the financial assets are measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’).

The business model reflects how groups of financial assets are managed to achieve a particular business objective. Financial assets can only be held at amortized cost if the instruments are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows (‘hold to collect’), and where those contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Assets may be sold out of ‘hold to collect’ portfolios where there is an increase in credit risk. Disposals for other reasons are permitted but such sales should be insignificant in value or infrequent in nature.

Debt instruments where the business model objectives are achieved by collecting the contractual cash flows and by selling the assets (‘hold to collect and sell’) and that have SPPI cash flows are held at FVOCI, with unrealized gains or losses deferred in reserves until the asset is derecognized.

The classification of equity instruments is generally measured at FVTPL unless the Bank, at initial recognition, irrevocably designates as FVOCI but both unrealized and realized gains or losses are recognized in reserves and no amounts other than dividends received are recognized in the income statement. All other financial assets will mandatorily be held at FVTPL. Financial assets may be designated at FVTPL only if doing so eliminates or reduces an accounting mismatch.

The NCR may become available for distribution through a stock dividend only with prior approval of the SBP. The Bank, before distribution of the gain as a stock dividend, may adjust any subsequent provisions/deficit, assessed by the Bank or recommended by the Banking Inspection Department of SBP, in the acquired assets and liabilities of NIB Bank Limited against the NCR.| | | | | | | |

These mainly represent counter claims by borrowers for damages and other claims relating to banking transactions. Based on legal advice and/or internal assessments, management is confident that the matters will be decided in the Bank’s favour and the possibility of any adverse outcome is remote. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 25.4

Taxation

For assessment year 1999-2000 through tax year 2023, the tax department disputed Bank's treatment on certain issues, where the Bank's appeals are pending at various appellate forums, entailing an additional tax liability of Rs. 2,239.380 million (2023: 5,902.495 million). Such issues inter alia principally include disallowance of expenses for non-deduction of withholding tax and non-availability of underlying records, provision for non-performing loans, attribution of expenses to heads of income other than income from business and disallowance of credit for taxes paid in advance/deducted at source.

The Bank has filed appeals which are pending at various appellate forums. In addition, certain decisions made in favour of the Bank are being contested by the department at higher forums. No provision has been made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements regarding the aforesaid additional tax demand and already issued favourable decisions where the department is in appeal, as the management is of the view that the issues will be decided in the Bank's favour as and when these are taken up by the Appellate Authorities.

# 25.5

Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amounting to Rs 28.08 billion of Ex. NIB. Issue of goodwill and other related assets amortization for few years has been assessed in Bank’s favour at appellate forums, however, the tax department has filed appeal against these decisions. The management has not recorded any tax benefit because the issue has not attained finality.

# 37. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The table below analyses the financial and non-financial assets carried at fair values, by valuation methods. For financial assets, the Bank essentially carries its investments in debt and equity securities at fair values. In case of non-financial assets, the Bank has adopted revaluation model (as per IAS 16) in respect of land and building & non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims.

Fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 37.1 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 2:

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Federal Government securities|The fair values of Treasury Bills and fixed rate Pakistan Investments Bonds are determined using the PKRV rates while floating rate Pakistan Investments Bonds are revalued using PKFRV rates. The fair values of foreign currency denominated GoP Eurobonds are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg.|
|Term Finance and Bonds|Investments in debt securities (comprising term finance certificates, bonds and any other security issued by a company or a body corporate for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.|
|Foreign Government Debt Securities|The fair values of Foreign Government debt securities are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg.|
|Foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
|Derivatives|The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currency involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration etc.|
|Unlisted Shares|Breakup value determined on the basis of NAV of the company using the latest available audited financial statements.|
|Mutual Funds|Units of mutual funds are valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).|
|Operating fixed assets (land and building) & Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets.|

The Bank's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period.

# (a) Financial instruments in level 1

Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in listed ordinary shares.

# (b) Financial instruments in level 2

Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Mutual Fund units, Term Finance certificates, FX Options, Cross Currency Swaps, Interest Rate Swaps and Forward Exchange Contracts.

# (c) Financial instruments in level 3

Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.

# 1. STATUS AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

The Group consists of:

- Holding Company - MCB Bank Limited
- Subsidiary Companies

|Percentage holding of MCB Bank Limited| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | |MCB Investment Management Limited|81.42%|
| | | |MCB Non-Bank Credit Organization Closed Joint Stock Company|99.94%|
| | | |MCB Islamic Bank Limited|100%|
| | | |MCB Exchange Company (Private) Limited *|100%|

*During the period, the Holding company injected share capital of Rs 1.0 billion into MCB Exchange Company (Private) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

2.1 These consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of MCB Bank Limited and its subsidiary companies and share of the profit / reserves of associates (the "Group").

a. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date when control ceases. The assets and liabilities of subsidiary companies have been consolidated on a line by line basis based on the financial statements for the three months period ended March 31, 2024 and the carrying value of investments held by the parent is eliminated against the subsidiaries' shareholders' equity in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements. Material intra-Group balances and transactions have also been eliminated.

b. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost, thereafter adjusted for the post-acquisition change in the Group's share of net assets of the associates. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted in the carrying amount of the investment. Accounting policies of the associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. The Group's share in associates have been accounted for based on the financial statements for the three months period ended March 31, 2024.

c. Non-controlling interest is that part of the net results of operations and of net assets of subsidiary companies attributable to interests which are not owned by the Group.

2.2 In accordance with the directives of the Federal Government regarding the shifting of the banking system to Islamic modes, the State Bank of Pakistan has issued various circulars from time to time. Permissible forms of trade-related modes of financing include purchase of goods by banks from their customers and immediate resale to them at appropriate profit in price on deferred payment basis. The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilized and the appropriate portion of profit thereon.

The financial results of the Group's Islamic Banking business have been consolidated in these financial statements for reporting purposes, after eliminating material inter-group transactions / balances.

2.3 The annexed notes 1 to 43 form an integral part of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

2.4 These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except that certain classes of fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are stated at revalued amounts and certain investments and derivative financial instruments have been marked to market and are carried at fair value. In addition, obligations in respect of staff retirement benefits are carried at present value.

# For The Three Months Period Ended March 31, 2024

# 3. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

# 3.1

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. The accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting comprise of:

- International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, Interim Financial Reporting, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

# 3.2

The State Bank of Pakistan has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standards 40, 'Investment Property' for Banking Companies through BSD Circular No. 10 dated August 26, 2002. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has deferred applicability of IFRS 7 "Financial Instruments: Disclosures" on banks through S.R.O 411(1)/2008 dated April 28, 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements. However, investments have been classified and valued in accordance with the requirements prescribed by the State Bank of Pakistan through various circulars.

# 3.3

# 3.4

The disclosures made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on a format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 02 of 2023 dated February 09, 2023 and IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. These consolidated condensed interim financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the audited annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2023.

# 3.5

Standards, Interpretations of and Amendments to Approved Accounting Standards That are Effective in the Current Period There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Group's accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any material effect on the Group's operations and therefore not detailed in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements except for IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments", the impact of which is disclosed under note 4.2.

# 3.6

Standards, Interpretations of and Amendments to Approved Accounting Standards That are not yet Effective There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Group's accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any material effect on the Group's operations and therefore not detailed in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The material accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the audited annual consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for changes mentioned in notes 4.1 and 4.2.

# 4.1

Adoption of New Forms for the Preparation of Consolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 09, 2023, issued the revised forms for the preparation of the consolidated condensed interim financial statements of the Banks. The implementation of the revised forms has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the condensed interim financial statements. Right of use assets and corresponding lease liability are now presented separately on the face of the Statement of financial position. Previously, these were presented under property and equipment (earlier titled as fixed assets) and other liabilities respectively. There is no impact of this change on the consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 4.2

Impact of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9, Financial Instruments addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard introduces a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on an 'Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than the 'incurred credit losses' approach as currently followed. The ECL approach has an impact on all assets of the Group which are exposed to credit risk. In preparation of these financial statements, the Group has applied requirements of IFRS 9 and application instructions issued by SBP with the date of initial application of January 01, 2024 with modified retrospective approach for restatement. As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group has not restated comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognized in the opening retained earnings and other reserves at the beginning of the current year without restating the comparative figures.

# CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the business model within which they are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’) regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Group’s business model in which financial assets are held determines whether the financial assets are measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’).

The business model reflects how groups of financial assets are managed to achieve a particular business objective. Financial assets can only be held at amortized cost if the instruments are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows (‘hold to collect’), and where those contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Assets may be sold out of ‘hold to collect’ portfolios where there is an increase in credit risk. Disposals for other reasons are permitted but such sales should be insignificant in value or infrequent in nature.

Debt instruments where the business model objectives are achieved by collecting the contractual cash flows and by selling the assets (‘hold to collect and sell’) and that have SPPI cash flows are held at FVOCI, with unrealized gains or losses deferred in reserves until the asset is derecognized.

The classification of equity instruments is generally measured at FVTPL unless the Group, at initial recognition, irrevocably designates as FVOCI but both unrealized and realized gains or losses are recognized in reserves and no amounts other than dividends received are recognized in the income statement.

All other financial assets will mandatorily be held at FVTPL. Financial assets may be designated at FVTPL only if doing so eliminates or reduces an accounting mismatch.

# The Requirements of IFRS 9 Led to Changes in Classification of Certain Financial Assets Held By The Group Which are Explained as Follows:

# Equity Instruments Previously Classified as Available for Sale (AFS)

The Group has elected to irrevocably designate all quoted and unquoted equity securities previously classified as available for sale (AFS) as FVOCI except units of open end mutual funds amounting to Rs. 115.98 million classified as FVTPL. The fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities.

# Debt Instruments Previously Classified as Available for Sale (AFS)

Debt instruments previously classified as AFS upon passing the SPPI test have been designated as fair value through OCI under IFRS 9 as the Group’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, but also to sell those investment. There is no change to their measurement basis and realized and unrealized gain/loss under IFRS 9.

# Debt Instruments Previously Classified as Held to Maturity (HTM)

Debt instruments currently classified as HTM upon passing the SPPI test have been designated as amortized cost under IFRS 9 as the Group’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows. There is no change to their measurement basis.

# 23.1

Under IFRS-3 a bargain purchase represents an economic gain which should be immediately recognized by the acquirer as income. However, the amount of bargain purchase gain was not taken to the profit and loss account as the SBP, through its letter BPRD(R&PD)/2017/14330 dated June 13, 2017 recommended that the amount of gain may be routed directly into equity as a Non-distributable Capital Reserve (NCR). The NCR may become available for distribution through a stock dividend only with prior approval of the SBP. The Bank, before distribution of the gain as a stock dividend, may adjust any subsequent provisions/deficit, assessed by the Bank or recommended by the Banking Inspection Department of SBP, in the acquired assets and liabilities of NIB Bank Limited against the NCR.

# 23.2

Statutory reserve represents amount set aside as per the requirements of section 21 of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962.

# 37. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The table below analyses the financial and non-financial assets carried at fair values, by valuation methods. For financial assets, the Group essentially carries its investments in debt and equity securities at fair values. In case of non-financial assets, the Group has adopted revaluation model (as per IAS 16) in respect of land and building & non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims.

Fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and financial liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 37.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).
