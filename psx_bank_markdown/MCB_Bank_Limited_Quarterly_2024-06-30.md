| |96,800|
|Profit Available for Appropriation|128,736|
|Appropriations:| |
|Statutory Reserve|(3,194)|
|Final Cash Dividend at Rs. 9.0 per share - December 2023|(10,666)|
|First Interim Cash Dividend at Rs. 9.0 per share - March 2024|(10,666)|
|Total Appropriations|(24,526)|
|Un-appropriated Profit Carried Forward|104,210|

Through focused efforts of the Bank's management in building no-cost deposits base and optimizing its earning assets mix, MCB's Profit Before Tax (PBT) for the first half of 2024 increased to Rs 62.7 billion with a growth of 16%. Profit After Tax (PAT) posted a growth of 20% to reach Rs. 31.9 billion; translating into Earning Per Share (EPS) of Rs. 26.95 compared to an EPS of Rs. 22.52 reported in the corresponding period last year.

On the back of strong volumetric growth in average current deposits and timely repositioning within the asset book, net interest income for the first half of 2024 increased by 12% over corresponding period last year. Non-markup income increased to Rs. 18.3 billion (+30%) against Rs. 14.1 billion in the corresponding period last year with major contributions coming in from fee commission income of Rs. 11.3 billion (+29%), foreign exchange income of Rs. 4.9 billion (+38%) and dividend income of Rs. 1.7 billion (+13%).

Improving customer and interbank flows, diversification of revenue streams through continuous enrichment of service suite, investments towards digital transformation and an unrelenting focus on upholding high standards of service delivery supplemented a broad-based growth in income from fee commission; with trade and guarantee related business income growing by 50%, cards related income by 43%, credit related fee by 41% and branch banking customer fees by 20%.

The Bank continues to manage an efficient operating expense base and monitor costs prudently. Amidst a persistently high inflationary environment and continued investments in human resources and technological upgradation, the operating expenses of the Bank were reported at Rs. 28.4 billion (+18%). Increase was primarily on account of staff cost (+15%), utility cost (+28%) and IT related expenses (+22%). The cost to income ratio of the Bank stands at 30.50% as compared to 29.58% reported in the corresponding period last year.

Navigating a challenging operating and macroeconomic environment, the Bank has been addressing asset quality issues by maintaining discipline in management of its risk return decisions. Diversification of the loan book across customer segments and a robust credit underwriting framework that encompasses structured assessment models, effective pre-disbursement evaluation tools and an array of post disbursement monitoring systems has enabled MCB to effectively manage its credit risk; the Non-performing loan (NPLs) base of the Bank was reported at Rs. 57.0 billion as at June 30, 2024. The coverage and infection ratios of the Bank were reported at 89.07% and 8.64% respectively.

On the financial position side, the total asset base of the Bank was reported at Rs. 2.67 trillion with increase of 10.1% over Dec 2023. Increase was contributed by 19% increase in investment base i.e. Rs. 232 billion over Dec 2023 and 6% increase in advances (gross) i.e. Rs. 37 billion over Dec 2023.

The Bank continued its focus on building no cost deposits, leading to a growth of Rs. 110 billion (+13%) in absolute current deposits during first half of 2024. The Bank's total deposit base stands at Rs. 1.99 trillion. The domestic cost of deposits was contained at 10.76% as compared to 7.93% in the corresponding period of last year despite the significant increase in average policy rate during the period.

Return on Assets and Return on Equity was maintained at 2.50% and 30.08% respectively, whereas the book value per share was reported at Rs. 184.04.

During the period under review, MCB attracted home remittance inflows of USD 1,973 million (+23%) to consolidate its position as an active participant in SBP's cause for improving flow of remittances into the country through banking channels.

While complying with the regulatory capital requirements, the Bank's total Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is improved to 20.68% against the requirement of 11.5% (including capital conservation buffer of 1.50% as reduced under the BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020). Quality of the capital is evident from Bank's Common Equity Tier-1 (CET1) to total risk weighted assets ratio which comes to 17.09% against the requirement of 6%. Bank's capitalization also resulted in a Leverage Ratio of 6.23% which is well above the regulatory limit of 3.0%. The Bank reported Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 261.91% and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of 164.85% against requirement of 100%.

The Board of Directors has declared 2nd interim cash dividend of Rs. 9.0 per share i.e. 90%, in addition to 90% already paid, bringing the total cash dividend for the half year ended June 30, 2024 to 180%.

# Ratings

Pakistan Credit Rating Agency re-affirmed credit ratings of MCB at “AAA / A1+” for long term and short term respectively, through its notification dated June 22, 2024.

# Economy Review

The Pakistani economy has shown signs of improvement in the second quarter of 2024, with key indicators pointing to a gradual recovery. Inflation has decelerated sharply, dropping from a high of 29.40% YoY in June 2023 to 12.57% YoY in June 2024. GDP growth accelerated to 2.4% in FY 2024, a marked improvement from the previous year's contraction of 0.21%. The government aims to achieve a growth rate of 3.6% in the FY 2024-25. During the first half of 2024, the State Bank of Pakistan has cut interest rates by 150 basis points to 20.50%, helping to restore business confidence.

On the external front, a sustained improvement was observed in the current account balance. The current account posted a deficit of USD 0.681 billion for FY 2024, compared to a deficit of USD 3.275 billion last year, largely reflecting improvements in the trade balance (trade deficit declining by 6% YoY) and remittances (increasing by 11% YoY). Total net foreign investment during FY 2024 recorded an inflow of USD 1.519 billion as against an inflow of USD 0.6 billion last year.

# The government has approved a tight budget for FY 2024-25

with a fiscal deficit target of 5.9% of GDP. The budget includes measures to increase revenues target by approximately 38%, with a focus on broadening the tax base and improving tax compliance.

# Future Outlook

In the month of July, Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached a staff level agreement for a USD 7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program. The program bodes well for the economy as it aims to capitalize on the traction in macroeconomic stability achieved over the past year by furthering efforts to strengthen public finances, reduce inflation, rebuild external buffers and remove economic distortions to spur private-sector led growth.

The higher budget revenue target is expected to further reduce aggregate demand in the economy, with inflation expected to reduce further. This is likely to provide further room to the SBP to cut interest rates in the future.

Despite the economic improvements seen in the second quarter of 2024, significant challenges remain - higher interest payments, sustainable external financing, and implementation of IMF's program conditions. To achieve sustainable growth, Pakistan needs to address its long-standing structural issues, such as a narrow tax base, inefficient state-owned enterprises, and lack of competitiveness.

# Appreciation and Acknowledgements

The Board of Directors of MCB Bank Limited would like to extend their sincere gratitude towards the Government of Pakistan, the State Bank of Pakistan, the Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan and other regulatory bodies for their continued support and guidance, all shareholders and customers of the Bank for their trust, and our employees for their continuous dedication and commitment.

For and on behalf of the Board of Directors,

August 07, 2024

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REVIEW REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF MCB BANK LIMITED

# Unconsolidated Condensed Interim Statement of Financial Position

# As At June 30, 2024

# REPORT ON REVIEW OF UNCONSOLIDATED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position of MCB Bank Limited (“the Bank”) as at June 30, 2024 and the related unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of changes in equity, and unconsolidated condensed interim cash flow statement, and notes to the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements for the six-month period then ended (here-in-after referred to as the “interim financial statements”). Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements based on our review. The figures for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 in the unconsolidated condensed interim profit and loss account and unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income have not been reviewed and we do not express a conclusion on them.

# Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”. A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

# Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor's review report is Hammad Ali Ahmad.

- International Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IAS 34, IFRS or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives, shall prevail.

3.2 The State Bank of Pakistan has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standards 40, 'Investment Property' for Banking Companies through BSD Circular No. 10 dated August 26, 2002. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has deferred applicability of IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' on banks through S.R.O 411(1) / 2008 dated April 28, 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

3.3 The SECP vide its notification SRO 633 (I)/2014 dated 10 July 2014, adopted IFRS 10 effective from the periods starting from June 30, 2014. However, vide its notification SRO 56 (I)/2016 dated January 28, 2016, it has been notified that the requirements of IFRS 10 and section 228 of the Companies Act, 2017 will not be applicable with respect to the investment in mutual funds established under trust structure.

# 3.4

The disclosures made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on a format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 02 of 2023 dated February 09, 2023 and IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the audited annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the audited annual unconsolidated financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2023.

# 3.5 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to approved accounting standards that are effective in the current period

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any material effect on the Bank's operations and therefore are not detailed in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements except for IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', the impact of which is disclosed under note 4.2.

# 3.6 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to approved accounting standards that are not yet effective

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any material effect on the Bank's operations except for:

|Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 – Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments|Effective date (annual periods beginning on or after)|
|---|---|
|IFRS 18 – Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements|January 01, 2026|
| |January 01, 2027|

# 4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The material accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the audited annual unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for changes mentioned in notes 4.1 and 4.2.

# 4.1 Adoption of new forms for the preparation of unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements

The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 09, 2023, issued the revised forms for the preparation of unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements of banks that are applicable for quarterly / half yearly periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 as per BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023. The implementation of the revised forms has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the condensed interim financial statements. The significant change is relating to right of use assets and corresponding lease liability which are now presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position. Previously, these were presented under property and equipment (earlier titled as fixed assets) and other liabilities respectively. There is no impact of this change on the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements in terms of recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities.

The Bank has adopted the above changes in the presentation and made additional disclosures to the extent applicable to its operations and corresponding figures have been rearranged / reclassified to correspond to the current period presentation, as presented in note 42.

# 4.2 Impact of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard introduces a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on an 'Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than the 'incurred credit losses' approach as currently followed. The ECL approach has an impact on all assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

In preparation of these financial statements, the Bank has applied requirements of IFRS 9 and instructions issued by SBP, through various circulars, from the date of initial application of January 01, 2024 with a modified retrospective approach for restatement. As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Bank has not restated comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognized in the opening retained earnings and other reserves at the beginning of the current year without restating the comparative figures.

The SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 has provided additional clarification on earlier issued 'IFRS 9 Application Instructions' to address certain key matters that had been raised by the banks with a direction to ensure compliance by extended timelines. There are a few other matters, including treatment of unencumbered general provision, which are still under deliberation with the SBP. The Bank has continued to follow the treatment adopted in respect of these matters in the prior periods till the time SBP issues the relevant guidance / clarification.

# 4.2.1 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Bank purchases or sells the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like advances, lending to financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account or financial institutions. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased.

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements (Un-Audited)

# For The Half Year Ended June 30, 2024

# a. Amortised cost (AC)

Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in the profit and loss account. Interest income / profit / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in the profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the profit and loss account.

# b. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for debt based financial assets in the profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the profit and loss account. On derecognition of debt based financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the profit and loss account. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is transferred from surplus / deficit to unappropriated profit.

# c. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs will be directly recorded in the profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in the profit and loss account. Interest / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

# 4.2.2 Classification and measurement

The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the business model within which they are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’) regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Bank’s business model in which financial assets are held determines whether the financial assets are measured at amortized cost (AC), fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’).

The business model reflects how groups of financial assets are managed to achieve a particular business objective. Debt based financial assets can only be held at amortized cost if these are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows (‘hold to collect’), and where those contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Assets may be sold out of ‘hold to collect’ portfolios where there is an increase in credit risk. Disposals for other reasons are permitted but such sales should be insignificant in value or infrequent in nature.

Debt based financial assets where the business model objectives are achieved by collecting the contractual cash flows and by selling the assets (‘hold to collect and sell’) and that have SPPI cash flows are measured at FVOCI, with unrealized gains or losses deferred in reserves until the asset is derecognized. The debt based financial assets that are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

The classification of equity instruments is generally measured at FVTPL unless the Bank, at initial recognition, irrevocably designates as FVOCI in which case, both the unrealized and realized gains or losses are recognized in reserves and no amounts other than dividends received are recognized in the profit and loss account.

All other financial assets will mandatorily be held at FVTPL. Financial assets may be designated at FVTPL only if doing so eliminates or reduces an accounting mismatch.

The requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Bank which are explained as follows:

# a. Debt based financial assets previously classified as available for sale (AFS)

The application of IFRS 9 has resulted in classification and consequent remeasurement of investments in INPC's, amounting to Rs. 5,699.494 million, held under AFS portfolio as of December 31, 2023 to FVTPL based on their business model assessment.

The failure of SPPI test upon assessment of contractual cash flows of debt based financial assets has resulted in classification and consequent remeasurement of investments in certain non government debt securities, amounting to Rs. 2,950.890 million, to FVTPL. All other debt based financial assets previously classified as AFS upon passing the SPPI test have been designated as FVOCI under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, but also to sell those investment. There is no change to their measurement basis and recognition of realized and unrealized gain/loss under IFRS 9.

# b. Debt based financial assets previously classified as held to maturity (HTM)

Debt based financial assets currently classified as HTM upon passing the SPPI test have been designated as amortized cost under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows. Investments in certain non government debt securities, amounting to Rs. 7,506.816 million, on failing the SPPI test have been reclassified to FVTPL.

# The following table reconciles the carrying value of investments in debt based financial assets as reported on December 31, 2023 to the carrying amounts on transition to IFRS 9 at January 01, 2024:

|Financial Asset|Measurement Category|Audited December 31, 2023|Measurement Category|Balance as of January 01, 2024 - before ECL|

* This amount includes overseas ECL for branches where IFRS 9 was already applicable.

# c. Equity instruments previously classified as available for sale (AFS)

The Bank has elected to irrevocably designate all quoted and unquoted equity securities previously classified as available for sale (AFS) as FVOCI except units of open end mutual funds, amounting to Rs. 115.98 million, that have been mandatorily classified as measured at FVTPL. The fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities.

IFRS 9 has eliminated impairment assessment requirements for investments in equity instruments. Accordingly, the Bank has reclassified impairment of Rs. 9,783.874 million on listed equity investments and Rs. 205.765 million for unlisted equity investments held as at December 31, 2023 to surplus / deficit on revaluation of investments.

# The measurement category and carrying amount of financial assets in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan before and after adoption of IFRS 9 as at January 01, 2024 are compared as follows:

|Financial Asset|Measurement Category|Audited December 31, 2023|Measurement Category|IFRS 9 January 01, 2024|

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements (Un-Audited)

# For The Half Year Ended June 30, 2024

# 4.2.3 Derecognition

Financial assets

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the profit and loss account.

# 4.2.4 Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with all advances and other debt based financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Bank recognises a credit loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money; and
- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR.

Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or interest payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations. 'Based on the level of increase in credit risk, the Bank shall calculate 12mECL for assets which did not have a SICR i.e., stage 1 or a LTECL for the life of the asset (for assets which demonstrated a SICR) i.e., stage 2.

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its financial instruments into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

|Stage 1:|When financial instruments are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.|
|---|---|
|Stage 2:|When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.|
|Stage 3:|For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises the LTECLs for these instruments. The Bank uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio / segment. When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs.|

Guarantee & Letter of Credit contracts:

The Bank estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit contracts respectively. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within other liabilities.

# 4.2.5 Adoption Impacts

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 effective from January 01, 2024 with modified retrospective approach as permitted under IFRS 9. The cumulative impact of initial application of Rs. 4,627.714 million has been recorded as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of the current accounting period. The details of the impacts of initial application are tabulated below:

|37. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS| | | | | | |
| | | | |The fair value of traded investments is based on quoted market prices, except for tradable securities classified by the Bank as 'amortized cost'.| | |
|Quoted securities classified as amortized cost are carried at cost. Fair value of unquoted equity investments other than investments in associates and subsidiaries is determined on the basis of break up value of these investments as per the latest available audited financial statements.| | | | | | |
|Fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.| | | | | | |
|In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and financial liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.| | | | | | |

# 37.1 Fair value of financial assets

The table below analyses the financial and non-financial assets carried at fair values, by valuation methods. For financial assets, the Bank essentially carries its investments in debt and equity securities at fair values. In case of non-financial assets, the Bank has adopted revaluation model (as per IAS 16) in respect of land and building & non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims.

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 2

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Federal Government securities|The fair values of Treasury Bills and fixed rate Pakistan Investments Bonds are determined using the PKRV rates while floating rate Pakistan Investments Bonds are revalued using PKFRV rates. The fair values of foreign currency denominated GoP Eurobonds are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg.|
|Term Finance and Bonds|Investments in debt securities (comprising term finance certificates, bonds and any other security issued by a company or a body corporate for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.|
|Foreign Government Debt Securities|The fair values of Foreign Government debt securities are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg.|
|Foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
|Derivatives|The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currency involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration etc.|
|Unlisted Shares|Breakup value determined on the basis of NAV of the company using the latest available audited financial statements.|
|Mutual Funds|Units of mutual funds are valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).|
|Property and equipment (land and building) & Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|The Bank's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period.|

# Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements (Un-Audited)

# For The Half Year Ended June 30, 2024

# 1. STATUS AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

The Group consists of:

|- Holding Company|MCB Bank Limited|"Percentage holding of MCB Bank Limited”|
|---|---|---|
|- MCB Investment Management Limited| |81.42%|
|- MCB Non-Bank Credit Organization Closed Joint Stock Company| |99.94%|
|- MCB Islamic Bank Limited| |100%|
|- MCB Exchange Company (Private) Limited *| |100%|

MCB Bank Limited (the 'Bank') is a banking company incorporated in Pakistan and is engaged in commercial banking and related services. The Bank's ordinary shares are listed on the Pakistan stock exchange. The Bank's Registered Office and Principal Office are situated at MCB - 15 Main Gulberg, Lahore. The Bank operates 1,428 branches (2023: 1,430 branches) within Pakistan and 08 branches (2023: 08 branches) outside Pakistan (including the Karachi Export Processing Zone branch).

*During the period, the Holding company injected share capital of Rs 1.0 billion into MCB Exchange Company (Private) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary.

# 1.1 Demerger of 39 Branches from MCB Bank Limited

The Board of Directors of MCB Bank Limited (MCB) in its meeting held on April 24, 2024 had approved the Scheme of Compromises, Arrangements and Reconstruction (the 'Scheme'), under Section 279 to 283 and 285 of the Companies Act, 2017, between the Bank and its wholly owned subsidiary MCB Islamic Bank Limited (MIB) to demerge business operations of its 39 branches and transfer to wholly owned subsidiary MIB subject to regulatory approvals.

No Objection Certificate of the State Bank of Pakistan on the Scheme was received on April 29, 2024 and petition was filed before the Honourable Lahore High Court for sanctioning the scheme of demerger. The shareholders had approved the Scheme in the Extra Ordinary General Meeting (EOGM) held on July 06, 2024.

Subject to sanction by the Honourable Lahore High Court, the banking business of these branches will stand converted into Islamic banking business and will be transferred to and vested in MIB against payment of cash consideration.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

# 2.1

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements include the financial statements of MCB Bank Limited and its subsidiary companies and share of the profit / reserves of associates (the "Group").

a. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date when control ceases. The assets and liabilities of subsidiary companies have been consolidated on a line by line basis based on the financial statements for the half year ended June 30, 2024 and the carrying value of investments held by the parent is eliminated against the subsidiaries' shareholders' equity in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements. Material intra-Group balances and transactions have also been eliminated.

b. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost, thereafter adjusted for the post-acquisition change in the Group's share of net assets of the associates. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted in the carrying amount of the investment. Accounting policies of the associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. The Group's share in associates have been accounted for based on the financial statements for the half year ended June 30, 2024.

c. Non-controlling interest is that part of the net results of operations and of net assets of subsidiary companies attributable to interests which are not owned by the Group.

# 2.2

In accordance with the directives of the Federal Government regarding the shifting of the banking system to Islamic modes, the State Bank of Pakistan has issued various circulars from time to time. Permissible forms of trade-related modes of financing include purchase of goods by banks from their customers and immediate resale to them at appropriate profit in price on deferred payment basis. The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilized and the appropriate portion of profit thereon.

The financial results of the Group's Islamic Banking business have been consolidated in these financial statements for reporting purposes, after eliminating material intra-group transactions / balances.

# 2.3

The consolidated condensed interim financial statements are presented in Pak Rupees, which is the Group's functional and presentation currency of its primary economic environment. The amounts are rounded off to the nearest thousand.

# 2.4

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except that certain classes of fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are stated at revalued amounts, certain investments and derivative financial instruments have been marked to market and are carried at fair value and defined benefit obligations and right of use of assets with related lease liability have been measured at present value on initial recognition.

# 2.5

The Group believes that there is no significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

# For The Half Year Ended June 30, 2024

# 3. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

# 3.1

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. The accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting comprise of:

- International Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IAS 34, IFRS or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives, shall prevail.

# 3.2

The State Bank of Pakistan has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standards 40, 'Investment Property' for Banking Companies through BSD Circular No. 10 dated August 26, 2002. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has deferred applicability of IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' on banks through S.R.O 411(1) / 2008 dated April 28, 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 3.3

The SECP vide its notification SRO 633 (I)/2014 dated 10 July 2014, adopted IFRS 10 effective from the periods starting from June 30, 2014. However, vide its notification SRO 56 (I)/2016 dated January 28, 2016, it has been notified that the requirements of IFRS 10 and section 228 of the Companies Act, 2017 will not be applicable with respect to the investment in mutual funds established under trust structure.

# 3.4

The disclosures made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on a format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 02 of 2023 dated February 09, 2023 and IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. These consolidated condensed interim financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the audited annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2023.

# 3.5

Standards, interpretations of and amendments to approved accounting standards that are effective in the current period There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Group's accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any material effect on the Group's operations and therefore are not detailed in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements except for IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', the impact of which is disclosed under note 4.2.

# 3.6

Standards, interpretations of and amendments to approved accounting standards that are not yet effective There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Group's accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any material effect on the Group's operations except for:

|Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 – Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments|Effective date (annual periods beginning on or after)|
|---|---|
|January 01, 2026| |
|IFRS 18 – Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements|January 01, 2027|

# 4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The material accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the audited annual consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for changes mentioned in notes 4.1 and 4.2.

# 4.1

Adoption of new forms for the preparation of consolidated condensed interim financial statements The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 09, 2023, issued the revised forms for the preparation of consolidated condensed interim financial statements of banks that are applicable for quarterly / half yearly periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 as per BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023. The implementation of the revised forms has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the condensed interim financial statements. The significant change is relating to right of use assets and corresponding lease liability which are now presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position. Previously, these were presented under property and equipment (earlier titled as fixed assets) and other liabilities respectively. There is no impact of this change on the consolidated condensed interim financial statements in terms of recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities. The Group has adopted the above changes in the presentation and made additional disclosures to the extent applicable to its operations and corresponding figures have been rearranged / reclassified to correspond to the current period presentation, as presented in note 42.

# 4.2

Impact of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard introduces a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on an 'Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than the 'incurred credit losses' approach as currently followed. The ECL approach has an impact on all assets of the Group which are exposed to credit risk.

In preparation of these financial statements, the Group has applied requirements of IFRS 9 and instructions issued by SBP, through various circulars, from the date of initial application of January 01, 2024 with a modified retrospective approach for restatement. As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group has not restated comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognized in the opening retained earnings and other reserves at the beginning of the current year without restating the comparative figures.

The SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 has provided additional clarification on earlier issued 'IFRS 9 Application Instructions' to address certain key matters that had been raised by the banks with a direction to ensure compliance by extended timelines. There are a few other matters, including treatment of unencumbered general provision, which are still under deliberation with the SBP. The Group has continued to follow the treatment adopted in respect of these matters in the prior periods till the time SBP issues the relevant guidance / clarification.

# 4.2.1

Initial recognition and subsequent measurement Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Group purchases or sells the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like advances, lending to financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account or financial institutions. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased.

# a. Amortised cost (AC)

Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in the profit and loss account. Interest income / profit / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in the profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the profit and loss account.

# b. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for debt based financial assets in the profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the profit and loss account. On derecognition of debt based financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the profit and loss account. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is transferred from surplus / deficit to unappropriated profit.

# c. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs will be directly recorded in the profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in the profit and loss account. Interest / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

# 4.2.2

Classification and measurement The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the business model within which they are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’) regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Group’s business model in which financial assets are held determines whether the financial assets are measured at amortized cost (AC), fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’).

The business model reflects how groups of financial assets are managed to achieve a particular business objective. Debt based financial assets can only be held at amortized cost if these are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows (‘hold to collect’), and where those contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Assets may be sold out of ‘hold to collect’ portfolios where there is an increase in credit risk. Disposals for other reasons are permitted but such sales should be insignificant in value or infrequent in nature.

Debt based financial assets where the business model objectives are achieved by collecting the contractual cash flows and by selling the assets (‘hold to collect and sell’) and that have SPPI cash flows are measured at FVOCI, with unrealized gains or losses deferred in reserves until the asset is derecognized. The debt based financial assets that are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

The classification of equity instruments is generally measured at FVTPL unless the Group, at initial recognition, irrevocably designates as FVOCI in which case, both the unrealized and realized gains or losses are recognized in reserves and no amounts other than dividends received are recognized in the profit and loss account.

All other financial assets will mandatorily be held at FVTPL. Financial assets may be designated at FVTPL only if doing so eliminates or reduces an accounting mismatch.

The requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Group which are explained as follows:

# a. Debt based financial assets previously classified as available for sale (AFS)

The application of IFRS 9 has resulted in classification and consequent remeasurement of investments in INPC's, amounting to Rs. 5,699.494 million, held under AFS portfolio as of December 31, 2023 to FVTPL based on their business model assessment.

The failure of SPPI test upon assessment of contractual cash flows of debt based financial assets has resulted in classification and consequent remeasurement of investments in certain non government debt securities, amounting to Rs. 3,714.280 million to FVTPL.

# Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements (Un-Audited)

# For The Half Year Ended June 30, 2024

# 4.2.3 Derecognition

# Financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

# Financial liabilities

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the profit and loss account.

# 4.2.4 Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with all advances and other debt based financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Group recognises a credit loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money; and
- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

The Group has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Group uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or interest payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations. Based on the level of increase in credit risk, the Group shall calculate 12mECL for assets which did not have a SICR i.e., stage 1 or a LTECL for the life of the asset (for assets which demonstrated a SICR) i.e., stage 2.

Based on the above process, the Group categorizes its financial instruments into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

|Stage 1:|When financial instruments are first recognised, the Group recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Group calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.|
|---|---|
|Stage 2:|When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, the Group records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.|
|Stage 3:|For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Group recognises the LTECLs for these instruments. The Group uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio / segment. When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, the Group records an allowance for the LTECLs.|

# Guarantee & Letter of Credit contracts:

The Group estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit contracts respectively. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within other liabilities.

* This amount includes overseas ECL for branches where IFRS 9 was already applicable.

** The reconciliation between carrying amounts of financial assets before and after adoption of IFRS 9 has been disclosed in note 4.2.5

# Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements (Un-Audited)

# For The Half Year Ended June 30, 2024

# The calculation of ECLs

The Group calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash flows, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:

- PD The probability that a counterparty will default, calibrated over the 12 months from the reporting date (stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (stage 2) and incorporating forward looking information.
- EAD The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.
- LGD It is an estimate of magnitude of loss sustained on any facility upon default by a customer. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor. It is the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Group expects to receive, including any form of collateral.

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective interest rate (at reporting date), the Group uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date).

As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 and BPRD Circular Letter No.16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level.

Effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

When estimating the ECLs, the Group considers three scenarios (a base case, an upside, a downside). Each of these is associated with different PDs.

The Group's management has only considered cash, liquid securities, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals, while calculating EADs.

The credit exposure (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

# Definition of default

The concept of 'impairment or default' is critical to the implementation of IFRS 9 as it drives determination of risk parameters, i.e. PD, LGD and EAD. The Bank has defined that an exposure with regards to a particular obligor will be treated as having defaulted when either one or both of the following two events have taken place:

- If a customer fails to service mark-up and / or principal within days past due (dpd) criteria as prescribed by SBP from time to time;
- The Bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realizing security (if held).

# Write-offs

The Group’s accounting policy under IFRS 9 remains the same as it was under SBP regulations / existing reporting framework.

# Adoption Impacts

The Group has adopted IFRS 9 effective from January 01, 2024 with modified retrospective approach as permitted under IFRS 9. The cumulative impact of initial application of Rs. 5,206.317 million has been recorded as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of the current accounting period. The details of the impacts of initial application are tabulated below:

# 23.1

Under IFRS 3 a bargain purchase represents an economic gain which should be immediately recognized by the acquirer as income. However, the amount of bargain purchase gain was not been taken to the profit and loss account as the SBP, through its letter BPRD(R&PD)/2017/14330 dated June 13, 2017 recommended that the amount of gain may be routed directly into equity as a Non-distributable Capital Reserve (NCR). The NCR may become available for distribution through a stock dividend only with prior approval of the SBP. The Bank, before distribution of the gain as a stock dividend, may adjust any subsequent provisions / deficit, assessed by the Bank or recommended by the Banking Inspection Department of SBP, in the acquired assets and liabilities of NIB Bank Limited against the NCR.

# 23.2

Statutory reserve represents amount set aside as per the requirements of section 21 of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962.

# 37. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of traded investments is based on quoted market prices, except for tradable securities classified by the Group as 'amortized cost'. Quoted securities classified as amortized cost are carried at cost. Fair value of unquoted equity investments other than investments in associates is determined on the basis of break up value of these investments as per the latest available audited financial statements. Fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and financial liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 37.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 2

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Federal Government securities|The fair values of Treasury Bills and fixed rate Pakistan Investments Bonds are determined using the PKRV rates while floating rate Pakistan Investments Bonds are revalued using PKFRV rates. The fair values of foreign currency denominated GoP Eurobonds are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg.|
|Term Finance and Bonds|Investments in debt securities (comprising term finance certificates, bonds and any other security issued by a company or a body corporate for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.|
|Foreign Government Debt Securities|The fair values of Foreign Government debt securities are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg.|
|Foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
|Derivatives|The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currency involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration etc.|
|Unlisted Shares|Breakup value determined on the basis of NAV of the company using the latest available audited financial statements.|
|Mutual Funds|Units of mutual funds are valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).|
|Property and equipment (land and building) & Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|The Group's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period.|
