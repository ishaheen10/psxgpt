# A JOURNEY OF ACHIEVEMENTS

# Message From the Founding President & CEO

# Reflecting on a Legacy of Trust and Purpose

Alhamdulillah. All praise belongs to Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

As I pen this milestone message — my final contribution to Meezan Bank’s Annual Report as CEO — my heart is filled with profound gratitude, deep humility, and heartfelt reflection.

Gratitude — first and foremost, to Allah, who has showered His mercy and barakah upon this institution, guiding us through every challenge and blessing us beyond measure. Humility — because this success is not mine; it is part of something much greater — a vision beyond any one individual, built by an extraordinary team, strengthened by the trust of our customers and stakeholders, and, above all, guided by an unwavering commitment to Islamic principles that have defined Meezan Bank from the very beginning. Reflection — as I look back at this incredible journey, I can only marvel at how far we have come.

Meezan Bank has made history this year, becoming the first bank in Pakistan to surpass Rs 100 billion in profit after tax. Yet, as remarkable as this achievement is, true success is not measured in numbers, but in trust — trust from our customers, who believe in our mission; trust from our regulators, who have supported our growth; and trust from our employees, who see their work as more than a job — it is a mission, an amanah, a calling.

# From an Idea to an Industry

In the early 90s, Islamic banking was an untested idea — met with skepticism and uncertainty. It was my wife, Dr. Ghazala, who first encouraged me to step away from riba-based finance and seek — or, if necessary, create — a credible, sustainable alternative. In fact, it was she who coined the name "Al Meezan," inspired by Surah Rahman’s message of balance and justice.

That conviction led to the founding of Al Meezan Investment Bank in 1997 — at a time when Islamic banking in Pakistan simply did not exist. But Allah’s mercy is limitless. With His blessings, barakah, and the dedication of our team, what was once a distant dream is now a defining reality.

Meezan was never just about building a bank — it was about creating an industry. Before Meezan, there was no structured, credible Islamic banking model in Pakistan. From day one, our vision was clear: "Establish Islamic banking as banking of first choice..." Not just for Meezan, but for the entire financial landscape.

Over the past three decades, we have grown organically from a single office to over 1,000 branches. Along this journey, we also strategically acquired the Pakistan operations of two global banks, strengthening our foundation. In 2002, we acquired Societe Generale's four-branch network, which enabled us to secure a commercial banking license and transition from Al Meezan Investment Bank into Pakistan’s first full-fledged Islamic commercial bank — Meezan Bank Limited. And in 2014, we acquired HSBC Pakistan’s ten-branch network, bringing with it invaluable technical expertise and a standards-based approach. These milestones played a pivotal role in shaping Meezan into the industry leader it is today.

Alhamdulillah, our unwavering commitment to this mission has not only made us the Best Islamic Bank but also the only bank in Pakistan to be recognized as Best Bank by the Pakistan Banking Awards — four times in the past seven years. This is more than just an accolade; it is proof that ethical, riba-free finance is not only viable but superior.

Today, Islamic finance is flourishing — embraced by regulators, businesses, and millions of customers. And Meezan Bank is more than just a leader in this space — it is the very face of Islamic banking in Pakistan. A benchmark of trust, excellence, and uncompromising Shariah compliance, Meezan has set the standard for what Islamic finance can and should be.

Seeing this industry grow and thrive, with new players entering the market, is deeply fulfilling. What once seemed like an ambitious dream is now an unstoppable movement — one that, insha’Allah, will shape Pakistan’s economic future for generations to come.

# The Pillars of Meezan’s Success

If I were to distill the secret behind Meezan’s success, three fundamental principles stand out:

- Faith – The Foundation of Everything: Meezan was founded on unwavering faith — not just in the principles of Islamic finance, but in the conviction that if we remained sincere in our purpose, Allah would place barakah in our efforts. Every major decision we made — no matter how difficult — was guided by Shariah compliance and integrity.
- People – The Heart of Meezan: Meezan’s greatest strength is its people. This institution was built not by one person, but by tens of thousands of dedicated individuals who believed in its mission, who worked with sincerity and excellence, and who saw Meezan not as a job, but as a cause. Their dedication, sincerity, and excellence have shaped Meezan into what it is today. Our customers, shareholders, Shariah Board, and Board of Directors have been pillars of trust and support, making it possible for Meezan to not only thrive but redefine banking in Pakistan.
- Balance – The Principle of Meezan: The name ‘Meezan’ means balance, and this principle has guided our journey at every step — balancing faith with professionalism, growth with sustainability, profitability with ethics, and ambition with humility. This equilibrium has been our strength, ensuring that success is not just measured in numbers, but in integrity and impact. We never chased short-term gains at the cost of long-term integrity — and Allah has blessed us for it.

# Leadership Continuity – A New Dawn

In accordance with the Code of Corporate Governance of the State Bank of Pakistan, I will, insha’Allah, retire on December 29, 2025, upon reaching the age of 70.

One of the greatest responsibilities of leadership is ensuring a seamless transition — a challenge that many organizations face. It is deeply gratifying to witness this critical process unfolding in a well-planned, structured, and orderly manner, ensuring stability and continuity for Meezan Bank’s mission.

As I prepare to pass the baton in December 2025, I do so with absolute confidence that Meezan’s future is in strong, capable, and committed hands. Syed Amir Ali, our Deputy CEO and CEO-designate, is not just a seasoned banker — he is a leader deeply aligned with Meezan’s values, a firm believer in Islamic finance, and a driving force for innovation and excellence. I have no doubt that, under his leadership, Meezan’s dedicated team will continue to scale new heights.
---
Insha’Allah, while staying true to the mission that has deﬁned our journey. To the Meezan family — this is your time. Carry this mission forward with the same faith, excellence, and sincerity. Meezan Bank’s success has never been about any one person — it is about the mission.

It is an honour for me that post retirement I will continue serving Meezan Bank as a member of the Board, insha’Allah, with the trust and support of our shareholders. I look forward to contributing to the Bank’s continued growth and success in this new capacity.

# The Road Ahead – Challenges & Opportunities

As we celebrate this historic milestone, we must remain vigilant and forward-thinking. The road ahead will bring new challenges — economic uncertainties and evolving regulatory landscapes will test our resilience and adaptability. The rapid transformation of digital banking and fintech will demand continuous innovation and agility, while intensifying competition in the financial sector will require us to uphold our unwavering commitment to Shariah compliance and service excellence.

Yet, if Meezan’s journey has taught us anything, it is that challenges are opportunities in disguise. With faith and resilience, new doors will always open. And when you work with sincerity and purpose, Allah guides the way. I am reminded of the powerful words of Surah Rahman:

نﺎَﺴْﺣِْﻹا  ﱠﻻِإ ِنﺎَ ﺴْﺣِْﻹا ُءاَﺰَﺟ ْﻞَ ﮬ

"Is there any reward for excellence other than excellence?"

Meezan Bank stands as living proof of this divine promise - where every sincere effort, guided by integrity and excellence, has been met with rewards beyond imagination.

# My Message to the Meezan Family

To my team — past, present, and future: You are the guardians of this mission. Stay true to our values. Never compromise on ethics. Always strive for excellence. Islamic banking is not just an industry — it is a responsibility, an amanah (trust).

To our esteemed Chairman, the Board of Directors, and our distinguished Shariah Board - especially our founding Chairman, Hazrat Mufti Taqi Usmani Saheb — your unwavering guidance, wisdom, and support have been pillars of strength for Meezan Bank. Your dedication to this mission has been instrumental in shaping our journey, ensuring that Meezan remains firmly rooted in both excellence and Shariah compliance. I am deeply grateful for your leadership, commitment, and the trust you have placed in the team, the institution and the cause.

To our customers and stakeholders: Your trust has been our greatest asset, and we will continue to serve you with sincerity, excellence, and humility.

To my family — my late parents, my wife, my children: You have been my biggest supporters, my source of strength, and my greatest blessings.

Remember, Meezan’s story has just begun...May Allah always bless Meezan Bank, its people and its mission. Ameen!

Irfan Siddiqui

# Chairman’s Review

Alhamdulillah, Meezan Bank achieved record financial performance this year. Profit after tax reached Rs 101.5 billion, making Meezan the first bank in the country’s history to surpass Rs 100 billion in profitability.

Alhamdulillah, it gives me great pleasure to present the Annual Report of Meezan Bank for the year 2024.

Meezan Bank was established as an Investment Bank in 1997 and granted the first Islamic banking licence of Pakistan in 2002. It is gratifying to see that, over the past twenty-seven years, the Bank has emerged as the undisputed leader in Pakistan’s Islamic Banking sector. I am also happy to share that Meezan has once again been recognized as the Best Bank by Pakistan Banking Awards, the country’s most prestigious banking recognition. Alhamdulillah, Meezan is the only bank in the country to have received this esteemed accolade four times. The Bank has also been awarded the prestigious ‘Best Bank of the Year - Large Size Banks' award by the CFA Society of Pakistan for the fifth consecutive year.

On the international stage, Meezan has won the global award for 'Best Islamic Retail Bank' by Islamic Finance News (IFN), Malaysia, alongside securing five of the six country-level awards for Pakistan conferred by IFN. Furthermore, The Banker magazine, an esteemed publication of the Financial Times, London, has honored Meezan Bank as the Bank of the Year for both the Asia-Pacific region and Pakistan.

All these accolades that the Bank has achieved have only been possible due to the blessings of Allah, and we humbly bow our heads to Him in gratitude and thankfulness for enabling our modest efforts to yield such extraordinary results.

# Financial Performance and Challenges

Alhamdulillah, Meezan Bank achieved record financial performance this year. Profit after tax reached Rs 101.5 billion, making Meezan the first bank in the country’s history to surpass Rs 100 billion in profitability. This growth was driven by a strong increase in deposits, which grew to Rs 2.58 trillion. The Bank’s focus on expanding its financing portfolio across diverse customer segments led to a 57% increase in its financing portfolio, taking it to Rs 1.5 trillion.

Looking ahead, the Bank now faces a new set of challenges, including a declining policy rate, imposition of higher income tax and the imposition of Minimum Deposit Rate (MDR) on Islamic banks. Meezan is gearing up to navigate these new set of challenges by further strengthening its core business as well as exploring additional revenue streams to mitigate the impact of these factors.

Although the declining policy rate may present short-term challenges for the banking sector, it is ultimately beneficial for the economy, as lower cost of financing will support business growth, and in turn, boost credit demand, thereby contributing to Bank‘s long-term profitability.

# Leveraging Technology for Transformation

The banking sector is undergoing a transformative era, driven by revolution in Information Technology and Digital Banking. At Meezan Bank, we view technology as a cornerstone for innovation, enhanced security and exceptional customer experience.

We are making significant investments in cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics Process Automation and Data Analytics and have established specialized units to advance RPA and Generative AI capabilities, enabling the Bank to maintain high responsiveness & service quality even as transaction.
---
# Current Performance Overview

Volumes grow exponentially. The excellent results of our technology-driven initiatives have enabled us to maintain our leadership in digital transactions, evidenced by the following:

- Mobile App Transactions grew from Rs 11.8 trillion in 2023 to Rs 18.1 trillion in 2024, a 52.75% increase in a single year while maintaining the industry leading rating on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
- Number of Active Mobile App Users increased from 1.6 million to over 2.3 million in 2024.
- Raast Payments volume grew from Rs 688 billion in 2023 to Rs 2.7 trillion in 2024, a remarkable 297% growth.
- Digital Bill Payments increased by 54%, from Rs 716 million to over Rs 1.1 trillion in 2024.

# Commitment to Sustainability & Responsible Growth

Meezan Bank remains committed to sustainability, integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into its strategy. In 2024, the Bank expanded its renewable energy initiatives, converting 166 branches and part of its Head Office to solar power, cutting carbon emissions by 1,000 metric tons annually—equivalent to planting 50,000 trees. It also advanced green financing, supporting wind and hydropower projects and providing Rs. 223 million in solar financing as well as promoting electric mobility through its Electric Bike Financing portfolio.

On the social front, Meezan Bank enhanced financial inclusion and community well-being by supporting small businesses, entrepreneurs, and the agricultural sector with tailored financing solutions. It also championed water conservation through recycling and rainwater harvesting initiatives.

# Our Commitment to People

Meezan Bank remains dedicated to employee engagement and well-being through various initiatives. The Employee Benevolent Fund Trust (EBFT) provided over Rs 300 million in financial assistance for medical, marriage, education, and emergency needs, benefiting more than 660 employees and their families.

The Meezan Scholar Policy, now extended to also include employees up to EVP grade, sponsored 146 children in higher education, including 136 Bachelor's and 10 Master's/MPhil programs. Additionally, the Annual Hajj Sponsorship Program continued, sending 10 employees with one dependent each on the pilgrimage with 100% sponsorship for employees and 50% for their dependents.

To strengthen long-term engagement, the Employee Share Option Scheme (ESOS) was continued, supporting talent retention and motivation.

# Board's Performance and Effectiveness

The Board of Directors of Meezan Bank has continued to demonstrate excellent leadership, strategic foresight, and governance throughout the year and has played a pivotal role in steering the Bank to its present levels of growth and success. The effectiveness of the Board’s performance is reflected in the Bank’s ability to navigate challenges, capitalize on growth opportunities, and maintain its position as the leading Islamic bank in Pakistan.

# Leadership Transition – A New Era for Meezan Bank

Meezan Bank stands at a historic transition as we prepare to bid farewell to our visionary founding CEO, Irfan Siddiqui, in December 2025. Under his exemplary leadership, Meezan Bank has grown from an ambitious idea into Pakistan’s largest and most successful Islamic bank, setting new benchmarks in ethical banking, financial performance, and customer trust. His unwavering dedication, deep-rooted commitment to Islamic banking, and relentless pursuit of excellence have shaped Meezan into an institution that is not just a bank but a movement. As he steps down, we express our deepest gratitude for his unparalleled contributions and the lasting legacy he leaves behind.

At the same time, we are pleased to welcome Syed Amir Ali as the next President & CEO of Meezan Bank. Amir is no stranger to Meezan—having started his banking career here and later making a significant mark as the CEO of BankIslami. With his deep expertise in Islamic banking, strategic foresight, and proven leadership, we are confident that Amir will carry forward Meezan’s legacy and lead it to even greater heights, Insha’Allah. This carefully planned leadership transition underscores Meezan’s commitment to continuity, stability, and long-term growth, ensuring that our journey of excellence continues seamlessly.

# Alignment with National Goals

The Government of Pakistan's commitment to transitioning the entire banking system to Islamic banking aligns seamlessly with our Vision of establishing ‘Islamic banking as banking of first choice…’. As the largest Islamic bank in Pakistan and pioneer in the industry, Meezan Bank is uniquely positioned to benefit from this transformation, as it will drive an increase in demand for our products and services. Our proven expertise, robust infrastructure, and dedicated workforce position us to effectively meet the anticipated surge in demand for Shariah-compliant products and services, ensuring continued sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders.

# A Heartfelt Thank You to Our Stakeholders

I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for being recognized as the ‘Best Central Bank in Promoting Islamic Finance’ by Islamic Finance News – Malaysia. This is, Masha ‘Allah, the seventh time in the past decade that SBP has won this award. This global recognition is a testament to the leadership and strong support provided by the State Bank in fostering a conducive environment for the growth of Pakistan’s Islamic banking industry. I would like to thank the State Bank of Pakistan, the Ministry of Finance and the Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan for their ongoing efforts to establish a viable Islamic financial system in the country.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to our shareholders, members of the Shariah Board, my fellow Board members and the entire Meezan team for their hard work and dedication in making Meezan Bank not only a leading financial institution in the country but also a symbol of excellence in the global arena.

Lastly, I would like to thank our customers for their trust and confidence in Meezan Bank and in the cause of Islamic banking. Your support has been instrumental in driving the growth and success of Meezan Bank and in advancing the establishment of a Riba-free financial system in Pakistan.

# Directors' Report to the Members

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the twenty-eighth Annual Report of Meezan Bank for the year ended December 31, 2024.

# Economy

Following a period of economic turbulence, 2024 marked a turning point for Pakistan’s economy, as a series of well-calibrated policy measures and structural reforms by the Federal Government set the stage for recovery. Decisive actions to stabilize macroeconomic fundamentals, coupled with efforts to restore investor confidence, played a pivotal role in reversing the downturn. These measures not only addressed immediate fiscal and external imbalances but also laid the groundwork for long-term, sustainable growth. As a result, the country’s GDP grew by 2.5% in FY 2024, rebounding from a contraction of 0.2% in FY 2023. This recovery was fuelled by increased industrial activity, robust agricultural output, easing inflationary pressures, and an improving current account balance. With these positive economic fundamentals in place, the growth momentum is expected to continue into FY 2025.

Inflationary pressures eased significantly in 2024, with Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation dropping to single digits after peaking at 38% in May 2023. By December 2024, inflation had fallen to 4.1%, its lowest level in nearly seven years. This sharp decline allowed the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to cut the policy rate by a cumulative 900 basis points, bringing it down from 22% at the start of the year to 13% by year-end. The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) also delivered a record-breaking performance, surpassing the historic milestone of 100,000 points for the first time. The KSE-100 index closed the year at 115,127 points, reflecting an exceptional 84% growth from its 2023 closing level of 62,451 points, ranking it among the world’s best-performing indices. This remarkable rally was primarily driven by improving economic fundamentals and strong investor confidence.

In FY 2025, foreign remittances have surged, playing a key role in maintaining a current account surplus in recent months. Workers’ remittances totalled USD 17.8 billion in the first six months of FY2025, marking a robust 33% year-on-year increase. The country’s foreign exchange reserves also strengthened, rising to over USD 16 billion as of December 2024, compared to USD 12.7 billion a year earlier. This improvement was supported by strong remittance inflows and a new USD 7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) agreement with the IMF. Meanwhile, structural reforms introduced by the Government to curb the sharp depreciation of the Pakistani Rupee (PKR) have helped stabilize the currency with Pak Rupee marginally appreciating to Rs 278.6/USD by the end of 2024 as compared to Rs 281.9/USD at the end of last year.

Overall, the country appears well-positioned for a sustained economic recovery, supported by sharply declining inflation, a lower policy rate that encourages economic activity, rising foreign exchange reserves, the elimination of the current account deficit, and a new 37-month funding facility agreed with the IMF.

# Our Performance

Alhamdulillah, Meezan Bank has achieved historic financial performance in 2024, accomplishing several milestones. Our Profit After Tax (PAT) experienced a growth of 20% over the previous year, surpassing the landmark figure of Rs 100 billion, reaching Rs 101.5 billion. Meezan maintains the distinction of being the most profitable bank in Pakistan. The basic Earnings per Share (EPS) increased to Rs 56.62 in 2024 from Rs 47.18 per share in 2023. This milestone was achieved despite tax rate applicable on banking companies increasing from 49% to 54% during the year.

| |120,000| | | | | |

# Dividend Per Share

We are delighted to announce that the Board has approved a final cash dividend of Rs 7.00 (70%) per share for the fourth quarter of 2024. This results in a cumulative cash dividend payout of Rs 28.00 (280%) per share for the year, which includes Rs 21.00 (210%) interim cash dividend distributed during the year. Alhamdulillah, we take pride in upholding our longstanding tradition of uninterrupted dividend pay-outs since the date of our listing on the Stock Exchange. The Bank has continued its prudent approach of striking a balance between dividend payouts and profit retention, enabling it to expand its equity base.

# Profitability

# Net Spread

The return on financings, investments and placements increased by 14% to Rs 494 billion in 2024 from Rs 432 billion in the previous year. This growth, driven by an increase in the average earning assets base, was partially offset by a decline in the underlying benchmark rate which averaged 19.6% in 2024 compared to 20.7% in 2023. Despite significant growth in profit earned, the Bank’s focus on growing its low-cost deposits portfolio resulted in the return on deposits and borrowings being maintained largely at last year’s levels (Rs 207 billion in 2024 as compared to Rs 205 billion in 2023).

# 31% Growth in Other Income

Fees, commission and other income increased by 20%, reaching Rs 22.5 billion compared to Rs 18.7 billion in the previous year. This growth was primarily driven by a higher volume of debit card issuances, increased trade volumes and improved branch banking income.

In 2024, we set a new industry record with debit card spend surpassing Rs 300 billion, reflecting a 30% YoY growth. We also reached a historic milestone of over Rs 30 billion in monthly spend, achieved in the month of December 2024, the highest in the industry. The Bank issued 1.2 million new debit cards in 2024, with the overall portfolio reaching approximately 4 million debit cards, a growth of 22% over December 2023. Additionally, Meezan Bank launched the FCY Debit Card in 2024, tailored for freelancers and IT exporters, providing seamless services for international payments. Resultantly, the Bank’s debit card related fee income was recorded at Rs 9.6 billion in 2024, growing by 18% YoY.

Meezan Bank solidified its position as a leader in digital fund transfers, playing a pivotal role in driving the digitalisation of payments in Pakistan. Our Mobile Banking App and Internet Banking platforms continue to be the preferred choice for customers to send and receive funds efficiently and in a secure manner. In 2024, these channels processed an impressive number of over 350 million fund transfer transactions, amounting to Rs 20 trillion, reflecting a remarkable growth of 47.5% in volume and 54% in value compared to the previous year. These figures underscore not only Meezan Bank’s leadership in digital banking but also the increasing reliance of customers on its secure and efficient digital channels for fund transfers.

Meezan Bank remains committed to delivering fast, reliable, and secure money transfer solutions, empowering customers to always manage their financial transactions seamlessly.

In 2024, the Bank’s home remittance volumes exceeded USD 1.2 billion, resulting in 144% growth in commission income, which reached Rs 603 million. With focus on striking a balance between import and export businesses, the Bank was able to grow its trade-related income by 22% to Rs 5.2 billion in 2024. The Bank also realised capital gains of Rs 3.5 billion this year, mainly on its GoP Ijarah Sukuk portfolio.

# Annual Report 2024

# Operating Expenses

Meezan Bank’s operating and other expenditures increased by 18% over the previous year, reaching Rs 84.6 billion from Rs 71.8 billion. The Bank opened 47 new branches across the country, taking the branch network size to 1,051 branches. Despite the increase in expense base, the cost to income ratio improved from 29% in 2023 to 27% in 2024 due to significant expansion in the Bank’s overall revenues.

# Taxation – Contribution to the National Exchequer

The Bank recorded a tax charge of Rs 120.6 billion for 2024 (2023: Rs 84.9 billion) due to historic high profitability as well as the applicable tax rate increasing from 49% to 54%. Additionally, we also collected / withheld and deposited Rs 61.0 billion (2023: Rs 37.5 billion) in the National Exchequer, on account of Income Tax / Federal Excise Duty / Provincial Sales Tax on Services, as withholding tax agent on behalf of the Federal and Provincial Tax Authorities.

# Balance Sheet Insights

The Bank’s total assets reached Rs 3.9 trillion by the end of 2024, marking a growth of 29% compared to the previous year end. This increase was driven by a significant rise in the Bank’s financing portfolio and continued investments in Federal Government securities.

# A snapshot of key business results achieved during the year is as under:

|Key Business Results|2024|2023|Variation|
|---|---|---|---|
|Total Assets|Rs 3.90 Trillion|Rs 3.01 Trillion|29%|

|Trade Business (Imports and Exports)|Rs 2.74 Trillion|Rs 2.16 Trillion|27%|

# Growth in Investments

Meezan Bank’s investment portfolio closed at Rs 1.87 trillion in December 2024, a growth of 19% compared to December 2023. The regular issuance of GoP Ijarah Sukuk has been a key driver in expanding the investment book, with overall sovereign / Government guaranteed securities comprising 99% of the Bank’s total investment portfolio.

The implementation of SBP’s Shariah-compliant Open Market Operations (OMO-Injections) and Shariah-compliant Standing Ceiling Facility has also played an instrumental role in the Islamic Banking Industry’s (IBI) day-to-day liquidity management, for which we remain grateful to the GoP and the SBP.
---
# Significant Expansion of Gross Financing Portfolio

Meezan Bank continued to expand its intermediation role in the economy and its Gross ADR rose to over 60% in December 2024 compared to 45% as in December 2023.

The Bank’s Consumer segment delivered strong growth in 2024 with a record Rs 39 billion gross disbursements within the Car Ijarah segment.

Meezan Bank has made SME financing a key priority, demonstrated by a 42% growth in its SME banking portfolio, which reached Rs 29 billion in December 2024. The Bank has been supporting SMEs through various initiatives including the Islamic SME Asaan Finance Scheme (I-SAAF), enabling customers to access the capital needed to expand their businesses and foster economic growth.

Digital financing has played a crucial role in this growth, with the launch of Pakistan’s first-ever Digital Supply Chain Financing (DSCF) platform, facilitating over Rs 32 billion in disbursements through 37,000+ transactions. By streamlining financing processes and providing easier access to credit, the platform has empowered SMEs, enabling them to optimize supply chains, enhance productivity, and contribute to the broader economy.

# Non-performing Financings and Provisions

At the end of 2024, the Bank’s non-performing financings stood at Rs 25.2 billion against total credit loss provisions of Rs 41.6 billion. A total provision charge of Rs 9.2 billion was recorded in 2024 as against Rs 7.3 billion last year, mainly against the Bank’s financing portfolio. The Bank maintains a non-performing financing coverage ratio of 165% - one of the highest in the banking industry.

# Deposit Base of over Rs 2.5 Trillion – Growth Stemming from Core Current & Savings Accounts

Meezan Bank’s deposits increased by 17% to Rs 2.6 trillion as at December 2024. Current and Saving Accounts (CASA) comprised 93% of total deposits in line with Bank’s strategy of growing low cost deposit base. Meezan Bank’s total deposits comprised 8.5% of the overall banking industry deposits. The Bank’s growing deposit portfolio is a testament to the trust and confidence its customers have placed in the Meezan brand. This achievement underscores the collective efforts of our team consistently working towards fostering strong customer relationships, delivering service excellence and upholding the core values of Shariah Compliance, Integrity and Service Excellence that define our banking model.

The Bank’s Current Account deposits marked a growth of Rs 130 billion or 12% over the previous year. Savings Account (SA) deposits crossed the landmark figure of Rs 1 trillion to stand at Rs 1.2 trillion at the end of the year, reflecting a growth of Rs 293 billion or 33% over December 2023.

# Roshan Digital Account (RDA)

Meezan Bank continues to maintain its leadership position in the market, demonstrating impressive growth in the Roshan Digital Account (RDA) initiative. In 2024, the Bank secured total inflows exceeding USD 2.5 billion, representing 27% of the total industry inflows. This solidifies Meezan’s position as a key player in the RDA segment. Currently, over 126,000 Meezan RDA accounts are operational, providing seamless and efficient banking services to overseas Pakistanis in more than 144 countries around the world.

We would like to express our sincere appreciation to the Pakistani diaspora for placing their trust in Meezan Bank as their preferred banking partner. Their continued support is integral to our success, and we remain committed to serving their banking needs with excellence.

# The Bank has a policy in place for dealing with conflicts of interest relating to members of the Board.

Under this policy, any director who has a business interest in a matter being presented at a Board meeting does not participate in either the discussion or the decision on that matter. This policy is applied consistently and there was no breach of this policy during the year.

# Performance Evaluation Mechanism for the Board

Members of the Board of Directors and its sub committees are competent and experienced individuals, representing diversified educational and vocational backgrounds which are invaluable in determining the overall direction of the organization.

The Board of Directors is keen to ensure that it reviews the effectiveness of its performance periodically. To that end, all individual board members answer a comprehensive questionnaire focused on evaluating, from various angles, whether the Board has discharged its duties diligently and with foresight. A committee of Directors is designated to manage the Board’s self-evaluation exercise and present its findings to the Board for deliberation and discussion.

# During the self-evaluation exercise, the Board evaluates itself from the following perspectives:

- Evaluation of the overall Board
- Evaluation of the Chairperson
- Evaluation of Individual Directors
- Evaluation of Independent Directors
- Evaluation of Board Committees
- Evaluation of the CEO

This exercise in critical self-assessment allows the Board to evaluate its performance and overall effectiveness in setting strategies, devising controls, reading market trends by monitoring micro and macroeconomic factors and responding to adverse unforeseen situations to further the cause of a learning organization. This process also ensures that the Board is constantly growing intellectually and the responsibility of steering the Bank to new heights of success is discharged effectively and efficiently.

The SBP Guidelines require that at least once in every three years, the evaluation should be conducted by an external independent evaluator. The Bank engaged Pakistan Institute of Corporate Governance (PICG) as an independent evaluator to conduct this evaluation in 2018, 2021 and 2024.

# Acknowledgement

We extend our heartfelt appreciation to the State Bank of Pakistan, the Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan for their unwavering commitment to establishing a sustainable Islamic financial system in the country. Our significant accomplishments would not have been possible without the proactive support of our diverse customer base, to whom we are deeply indebted. We also express our gratitude to the Board of Directors, members of the Shariah Board, our shareholders, holders of Additional Tier I Sukuk and Subordinated Sukuk (Tier II) for their continuous patronage for establishing Meezan Bank as the leading Islamic bank in the country.

We convey our appreciation to every member of our devoted team for their diligent efforts and steadfast dedication to furthering the mission of Islamic banking. Above all, we humbly acknowledge and offer gratitude to Allah Almighty for His continuous blessings upon our Bank and each one of us, which have enabled our notable achievements within a relatively brief timeframe. We beseech Him for His continued support, granting us the fortitude and insight to continue advancing our Vision of establishing ‘Islamic banking as the banking of first choice...’

# Review of Six Years’ Performance

The summary of financial performance of Meezan Bank Limited over the last six years (2019 – 2024) is as under:

# Statement of Financial Position

# Assets

In 2024, Meezan Bank achieved a significant milestone with total assets reaching Rs 3.9 trillion, marking a substantial increase from Rs 1.12 trillion in 2019. This growth was primarily driven by a strong rise in deposits. The liquidity generated from these deposits was strategically allocated towards investments and financing activities. The Bank’s investment portfolio experienced remarkable growth, expanding to nearly Rs 1.9 trillion from Rs 226 billion in 2019, reflecting an 8.3-fold increase. Notably, the Bank’s investments in Government of Pakistan (GoP) Ijarah Sukuk reached Rs 1.7 trillion, while its holdings in Pakistan Energy Sukuk, backed by the Federal Government, totalled Rs 118 billion.

The regular resumption of GoP Ijarah Sukuk auctions has helped mitigate the liquidity deployment challenges traditionally faced by the Islamic Banking sector. This has allowed the Bank to reduce its reliance on inter-bank secured placements under Bai Muajjal, which have remained stable at Rs 35 billion (approximately 1% of total assets as of December 2024), a sharp contrast to Rs 224 billion, or 20% of total assets, in 2019.

The Bank’s net financing portfolio closed at Rs 1.5 trillion, accounting for 39% of total assets, compared to Rs 494 billion in 2019, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% over the past five years. Throughout this period, the Bank remained committed to deploying liquidity across diverse sectors of the economy. The corporate segment was the primary driver of this growth, expanding to Rs 1.1 trillion, or 74% of the total financing book.

Despite operating in a consistently challenging economic landscape, the Bank took a balanced approach to growth, ensuring that all risk acceptance criteria were met. With an infection ratio of approximately 1.6%, one of the lowest in the industry, the Bank’s high-quality financing portfolio underscores its strong risk management practices.

# Liabilities

The Bank’s deposits reached Rs 2.6 trillion, reflecting a significant increase of 2.8 times from Rs 933 billion in 2019, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23% over the past five years. Current Account deposits experienced remarkable growth, rising by Rs 890 billion or 3.62 times, reaching Rs 1.2 trillion compared to Rs 339 billion in 2019. As a result, the Current Account share of total deposits increased to 48% in 2024, up from 36% in 2018. Savings Account deposits also saw strong growth, rising by Rs 827 billion from Rs 349 billion in December 2019, reflecting a 3.4-fold increase. Combined, Current and Savings Account (CASA) deposits crossed the Rs 2 trillion mark in 2024, reaching Rs 2.4 trillion by year-end.

In contrast, fixed deposits decreased by Rs 65 billion (26%), from Rs 244 billion in 2019 to Rs 180 billion in 2024. This shift aligns with the Bank's strategy of focusing on low-cost deposits, supporting its branch expansion and deposit mobilization efforts being the key drivers of profitability. The Bank attributes this success to the unwavering commitment of its staff in delivering high standards of customer service, alongside the seamless digital banking experience offered to customers.

The launch of SBP's Shariah Compliant Open Market Operation (OMO) and Standing Ceiling Facility at the beginning of 2022 allowed the Bank to manage its daily liquidity more effectively. By the end of 2024, the Bank had borrowed a total of Rs 390 billion from SBP under the SBP OMO. Additionally, it secured Rs 117 billion through various SBP-subsidized refinancing programmes aimed at targeted businesses and export-focused industries. The total outstanding amount owed to financial institutions stood at Rs 722 billion, a significant increase from Rs 42 billion in 2019.

The Bank’s fixed assets, excluding right-of-use assets under IFRS 16, increased to Rs 47 billion in 2024 from Rs 16 billion in 2019. This growth is primarily attributed to the Bank’s significant investment in expanding its branch network, which grew to 1,051 branches in 2024, up from 760 branches in 2019, marking an increase of 291 branches over the past six years. This strategic branch expansion has delivered favourable outcomes, reflected in the significant growth in deposits and profits across successive periods.

Furthermore, the Bank's substantial investments in technological infrastructure and digital channels have been instrumental in enhancing its fixed and intangible assets, further contributing to overall growth. As of December 31, 2024, the total Subordinated Sukuk amounted to Rs 21 billion, consisting of Rs 7 billion in Additional Tier I Sukuk and Rs 14 billion in Subordinated Tier II Sukuk. VIS Credit Company Limited has rated the Bank’s Tier I Sukuk at AA+ (Double A Plus) and Tier II Sukuk at AAA (Triple A). As a result, despite the significant growth in total assets from 2019 to 2024, the Capital Adequacy Ratio remained robust at 20.35% in 2024, well above the minimum requirement of 11.5%.

# Annual Report 2024
---
# Equity

The Bank’s equity grew to Rs 247 billion, up from Rs 59 billion in 2019, marking a significant increase over the past six years. The Bank remains dedicated to maintaining a careful balance between depositors' liabilities and shareholders' equity, ensuring an optimal capital-to-debt ratio. Additionally, the Bank has maintained a consistent track record of uninterrupted dividend payouts since its listing on the Stock Exchange, demonstrating its ongoing commitment to delivering value to shareholders over the long term.

Due to the expansion of its branch network and significant investments in IT infrastructure to support the increasing volume of banking transactions, the Bank experienced a rise in operating expenses, which reached Rs 85 billion in 2024, up from Rs 26 billion in 2019. This rise was further influenced by factors such as inflation and the devaluation of the rupee. Currently, the Bank employs more than 18,000 staff nationwide, a notable increase from the 11,649 employees at the end of 2019, thus contributing to greater employment opportunities.

# Profit and Loss Account

The Bank has achieved exceptional growth in Profit after Tax, increasing nearly seven-fold from Rs 15.2 billion in 2019 to Rs 101.5 billion in 2024. This growth aligns with the expansion of the Bank's asset base, a significant rise in current and savings accounts, and the increase in the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) policy rate. As a result, the Bank’s net spread surged to Rs 287 billion, up from Rs 47 billion in 2019. The Bank also saw impressive growth in fee, commission, foreign exchange, and other income, rising from Rs 9.4 billion in 2019 to Rs 23.4 billion in 2024. This increase in fee income is primarily driven by the Bank's rapidly growing trade business, which exceeded Rs 2.7 trillion.

# Financial Analysis

Sukuk is the plural of the Arabic word "Sak," meaning certificates. Sukuk are common Shariah-compliant instruments used by governments to raise funds for budgetary and public financing.

# Risk Management Framework

Meezan Bank manages risks through a framework of sound principles, including risk identification, establishing appetite and limits, assessing impacts, and creating policies to mitigate risks. Continuous monitoring and stakeholder reporting are ensured. The Board sets policy and strategic direction, while management develops procedures, structures, systems, and controls.

The Board has formed a Board Risk Management Committee with defined terms of reference to evaluate the Bank’s risk profile and ensure monitoring systems are in place. Additionally, the Board IT Committee oversees cybersecurity and technology risk management strategies. Risk governance is primarily exercised through the following management committees:

- Credit Risk Management Committee (CRMC)
- Business Continuity Steering Committee (BCSC)
- Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO)
- IT Steering Committee (ITSC)
- Compliance & Operational Risk Management Committee (CORMC)
- Service Board

The CRMC ensures that the Bank’s credit risk activities fall within the scope of approved policies, regulatory requirements, and risk appetite thresholds. The ALCO reviews market and liquidity risk exposures, assets and liabilities mix, maturity profile, repricing gaps, and sets pricing, making decisions for sound liquidity management. The CORMC focuses on issues arising from compliance risk, operational risk, Shariah non-compliance risk, and control issues. The BCSC ensures that adequate business continuity/disaster recovery plans are prepared, funded, tested, and that decision-making authority in the event of a crisis is clearly defined. The ITSC is responsible for assisting Senior Management in implementing IT and digital strategies approved by the Board of Directors and for playing an advisory role in all technology-related matters. It is also responsible for reviewing significant incidents, major risks, and breaches submitted by Information Security. The Service Board oversees and monitors the performance of all relevant departments involved, directly or indirectly, in delivering customer experience and providing services to both external and internal customers of the Bank.

Meezan Bank follows a ‘Three Lines of Defense’ model for risk management with clearly defined roles and responsibilities that are at the core of the Bank’s operations:

|Line of Defense|Definition|Ownership|
|---|---|---|
|First Line of Defense (1LoD)|Primarily responsible for risk identification and management in their respective fields of operation. They achieve this by complying with all policies, procedures, and regulations. This includes ensuring that all control procedures are followed on an ongoing basis.|Business Units & Support Groups|
|Second Line of Defense (2LoD)|Responsible for establishing risk management standards, policies, and frameworks, and providing assurance on policy implementation and the quality of controls. This involves reviewing the quality of controls, validating risk assessments, and recommending/reporting remediation needs in high-risk areas.|Risk Management, Compliance & Shariah Compliance Departments, & other Control Functions|
|Third Line of Defense (3LoD)|Providing independent assurance on the adequacy of the Bank’s internal controls.|Internal Audit, Shariah Audit, & Business Review Functions|

Meezan Bank has been designated as a Sample Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB) by the State Bank of Pakistan for 2024-2025. The Bank has a comprehensive Recovery Plan in place for dealing with various crisis scenarios, along with early warning signals and appropriate remedial actions during crises. The Bank has a Board-approved Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process Framework and Risk Appetite Statement, both of which are regularly reviewed and updated. The Bank has been continuously improving its stress testing framework to capture the impact of various shocks on the Bank’s business portfolio, capital adequacy, liquidity, and profitability.

The Risk Management Framework has been implemented by functions independent of commercial lines of business. The Risk Management Group (RMG) continues its efforts, focusing on improving policies and procedures, limit structuring, and strengthening systems and controls. Under RMG, the credit risk function caters to corporate, investment banking, commercial & SME, agriculture, supply chain, and consumer business segments. The Bank has an automated financing approval system for corporate, commercial, SME, agriculture, and supply chain customers, bringing significant improvements in customer facilitation. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) under RMG caters to market, liquidity, financial institutions, country, operational, environmental, and business continuity risks. ERM also deals with Basel and Capital Strategy Formulation and portfolio management. ERM works closely with Compliance, Shariah Compliance, and other relevant departments for risk management. The Information Security Department conducts regular cybersecurity reviews and penetration testing exercises performed by the internal team and cybersecurity consultants for continuous improvement. The Bank recognizes the importance of compliance, reputational, strategic, technology, conduct, and information security risks as distinct types of risks and continuously improves its practices to cater to these risks. Shariah non-compliance risk management principles are also at the heart of the business practices of the Bank.

# Risk and Opportunity Report

Risk assessment, management and oversight is a continuous activity at Meezan Bank. Based on the internal and external environment, the Bank’s governance works to identify, monitor, control and mitigate risks to formulate a strategy that is both risk-responsive and opportunity-aware.

# Key Sources of Uncertainty

Banks are typically exposed to risks including but not limited to credit, market, concentration, liquidity, operational, information security/cyber security, regulatory, compliance, reputational, strategic as well as Shariah non-compliance risks. Meezan Bank being the largest Islamic bank of the country, is fully aware of the importance and implication of Shariah non-compliance risk on its business and strategy.

Year 2024 started off with improvement in economic fundamentals due to strengthening of Pak Rupee, decline in inflation and increase in stock market index. Later in the year, SBP started monetary policy easing by slashing the rate from peak of 22% to 13%. The IMF agreement coupled with external support provided temporary relief to the economy. However, sustainable fiscal measures, and external support from IMF and other sources along with global political changes and overall law and order situation is expected to be the key determinant for the outlook of the country.

# Typical Risks Faced by the Bank

Shariah Non-compliance Risk
Credit Risk
Liquidity Risk
Information Security Risk
Market Risk
Operational Risk

Despite economic challenges, Meezan Bank continued its journey towards growth by increasing its deposits, private financing and total asset base. Financing was increased in various sectors of the economy with prudent selection of customers, keeping in view the current economic environment and risk return trade off. Moreover, the Bank continued its role as an active player in mobilizing deposits from overseas Pakistanis as evident from the increase in Roshan Digital Accounts deposit base. Continuous flow of GoP Ijarah Sukuk remained an element of relief to the Islamic banks in managing their excess liquidity.

Year 2025 is expected to be challenging due to implementation of minimum deposit rate mechanism for Islamic banks and increase in income taxes for banks. The continued declining trend in policy rate will result in higher demand for private sector financing and reduce the finance cost for the businesses resulting in positive impact for the overall economy.

# Statement of Board of Directors on Risk Assessment

The Board of Directors and its subcommittees comprising of Board members thoroughly assessed all principal risks including but not limited to credit, market, concentration, operational, liquidity, information security/cyber security, regulatory, reputational, strategic, technology, Shariah non-compliance and compliance risks through various reports including early warning indicators to ensure that the Bank has in place necessary policies, procedures, systems and controls to mitigate risks that may affect its business objectives, performance, financial viability and sustainability.

# Materiality Approach

The Bank gives due consideration to materiality concept while managing its risks. Resources are deployed efficiently in medium to high-risk areas while minor risks are typically managed through transfer and outsourcing arrangements. The Bank manages all its core operations on its own. Regulatory and Shariah compliance are at the heart of the Bank’s materiality approach while managing existing operations and taking new initiatives.

Meezan Bank will continue its journey of growth by exploring opportunities to achieve its strategic objectives, while ensuring that effective risk mitigants and controls are in place, Insha’Allah.

# Business Continuity Management

The Bank’s Business Continuity Plans are developed to enable the management of the impact of any crises and ensure uninterrupted operations. The Bank has implemented well-defined, approved plans, effective decision-making processes, outlined descriptions of distressed scenarios, and roles and responsibilities of various functions. This ensures coordinated efforts among stakeholders and operational continuity in case of any disruption. Simultaneously, the Bank has leveraged its technology infrastructure to improve its IT Disaster Recovery Set-up, developing the right contingency plans and mitigating actions beforehand.

The Business Continuity Plans facilitate the continuance of business activities and safeguard the interests of the Bank’s key stakeholders in the event of crisis situations by ensuring the appropriate availability of systems and other critical resources. The implementation of the plans ensures the safety of human resources, protection of critical assets, and the resumption of mission-critical activities from alternate processing site(s) in case the primary site(s) are not accessible or available.

Additionally, to test the Bank’s preparedness and ensure the continued relevance of Business Continuity Plans, the Bank carries out drills replicating real-life situations. At Meezan Bank, the priority is always to ensure the safety of human life in case of any disaster.

# Responding to Critical Challenges and Uncertainties

Economic fundamentals improved and political uncertainty showed a decline in Pakistan during 2024. However, law and order remained a key concern due to geopolitical situation as numerous military and civil forces were attacked during the year. Reversal in profit benchmark rates, witnessed during the latter part of the year, coupled with economic recovery, stability in exchange rate and decrease in rate of inflation and the Government’s effort to reduce political uncertainty and bring overall stability in the country, will result in improvement in paying capacity of financing customers. This in turn will translate into a decrease in risk of Non-Performing Financing. Moreover, the improvement in macroeconomic environment is expected to translate into improvement in the country’s GDP growth rate. However, fiscal policy remains a key challenge for the government to generate revenue. Going forward, sustainable fiscal measures, and external support from IMF and other sources along with global political changes and overall law and order situation are expected to be the key determinants for the outlook of the country.

# 2024 Focus Areas

- Robust Risk Assessment Mechanism
- Effective Portfolio Management
- Limits Structuring
- Four-eye Financing Approval Mechanism
- Rapid Portfolio Reviews
- Post Disbursement Monitoring

To maintain high level of assets quality, the Bank has equipped itself through robust risk assessment mechanism, effective portfolio management, limits structuring, four-eye financing approval mechanism, rapid portfolio reviews and post disbursement monitoring to minimize the level of its non-performing assets portfolio and early identification of distressed accounts. Moreover, effective limit structure with respect to Money Market, FX, Equity, and other FI exposures, are already in place to mitigate the risk.

Pakistan faces several significant climate risks, from extreme weather events to coastal vulnerabilities. Meezan Bank is aware of its pivotal role in the financial sector and how it can contribute towards mitigating such risks faced by the country. In line with the instructions of State Bank of Pakistan, the Bank is gearing towards implementing an Environment and Social Risk System which will enable the Bank to identify and manage exposure to the Environment & Social Risks of its customers.

Considering the exponential growth in digital banking, the Bank has state-of-the-art digital platforms in place including mobile app and internet banking, enabling it to provide efficient platforms to customers for performing their banking transactions hassle-free. Continuous growth of digital banking, has resulted in elevated cyber security risk for banks. To manage the associated risks, the Bank has preventive, detective and corrective controls implemented in the data center. The Bank also has an Information Security Department in place to have an independent oversight, manned with experienced and qualified resources. The Bank conducts regular cyber security reviews, cyber risk management and penetration testing exercises, performed by the internal team and cyber security consultants for continuous improvement. To maintain the highest standards of cyber security, the Bank also holds international certifications for its data centers and information security management functions. Continuous cyber security awareness is also provided to staff and customers on a periodic basis.

# Information Security Measures

- Strengthened the Bank’s Data Security Infrastructure
- Ensured regular and consistent Cyber Security Reviews across the Bank

The Bank’s strong focus on learning and development of its staff helps in ensuring their competitiveness and ability to face new challenges and uncertainties. The Bank has a competitive compensation plan and reward policy to ensure retention of existing staff and hire the best human resources from the industry.

# Performance Evaluation of the Board of Directors

The Board of Directors of Meezan Bank sets the Bank’s strategic direction and ensures that the organization stays true to this direction - enabling it to achieve its long-term objectives while ensuring regulatory compliance. To discharge its fiduciary responsibility of safeguarding the stakeholders’ interests, the Board of Directors has developed criteria for its performance evaluation as required by the State Bank of Pakistan and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.

The Board of Directors discusses strategic objectives, budgetary expenses and projected national and international macroeconomic indicators to ensure that the Bank’s business strategy stays aligned with macroeconomic indicators. The Board of Directors and its sub committees are competent and experienced, representing diversified educational and vocational backgrounds which are invaluable in determining the overall direction of the organization.

- Complete Board
- Chairman
- Individual Directors
- Independent Directors
- Chief Executive Officer
- Board Committees

# Performance Evaluation by External Consultant

Evaluation of Board of Directors is conducted annually as per the State Bank of Pakistan's requirement. Furthermore, SBP Guidelines also require that at least once in every three years, the evaluation should be conducted by an external independent evaluator. The Bank engages an independent evaluator to conduct the Board’s evaluation once in every three years as per regulatory requirement.

# Criteria for Performance Evaluation

The Board of Directors, while ensuring regulatory compliance, is also vested with fiduciary responsibility on behalf of the shareholders to protect the Bank’s interests, provide strategic direction and monitor the achievement of strategic objectives. The Companies Act 2017, Banking Companies Ordinance 1962, SBP’s Corporate Governance Regulatory Framework (CGRF) and Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations 2019 describe the role of Board of Directors along with its responsibilities and functions.

To comply with the regulatory requirement, the Board, in the year 2014, put in place an effective mechanism for Board Evaluation. All individual Board members answer a comprehensive questionnaire focused on evaluating, from various angles, whether the Board has discharged its duties diligently and with foresight. A committee of Directors is designated to collate individual responses and present them to the Board for deliberation and discussion. As per process, the responses / feedback from the Directors on each of the above-mentioned categories is compiled and submitted to the Board.

# Statement of Internal Controls

This statement is presented to comply with the requirements of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)’s BSD Circular No. 7 of 2004 dated May 27, 2004 “Guidelines on Internal Controls”, SBP’s OSED Circular No.01 dated February 07, 2014 and SBP BSD-1 Circular Letter No. 1 of 2021 dated July 06, 2021 on “Instructions on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR)”.

The management of the Bank is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate and effective system of internal controls which has the main objective of ensuring effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability of financial reporting, safeguarding of assets and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

The control activities are being closely monitored across the Bank through Compliance, Risk Management, Shariah and Internal Audit departments, which covers all banking activities in general and key risk areas in particular. The Management has Compliance and Operational Risk Management Committee (CORMC) which focuses on compliance risk issues and reviews the adequacy of controls and systems to meet the regulatory requirements. The Board of Directors has formed an Audit Committee which has direct oversight responsibility to ensure the independence of the internal and external audit functions. The Audit Committee meets at least once every quarter to discuss the scope and results of the work performed by the Compliance, Shariah and Internal Audit departments. The Audit Committee also meets with external auditors prior to approval of half-yearly and annual results of the Bank.

Based on observations and weaknesses found and identified by Internal and External auditors and the Compliance, Risk Management and Shariah audit teams, improvements are brought about by the management in internal controls to ensure non-recurrence of those exceptions and elimination of such weaknesses to the maximum possible level. Further, to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements including AML/CFT requirements, compliance managers along with their teams are also placed in major regions.

While the Internal Controls System is effectively implemented and monitored, there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system, including the possibility of human error or system failure, circumvention and overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that the system's objective will be achieved.

Alhamdulillah, the Bank had successfully completed all stages of its ICFR program in 2014 and has been granted exemption from the requirement of submission of Auditor-issued Long Form Report through SBP OSED letter /SU-12/017(01)/358/15 dated January 05, 2015. As required by the State Bank of Pakistan, the Bank now prepares annual assessment report on efficacy of ICFR duly signed by the Chairman, Audit Committee. Having successfully achieved closure on ICFR, the Bank remains cognizant of its responsibility to continuously improve and strengthen its system of Internal Controls on an on-going basis.

Based on the above, the Board of Directors endorses the management's evaluation of Internal Controls.

On behalf of the Board.

# Summary of Direct Payment in Murabaha Financing

During the year 2024, almost 99% of payments for Murabaha financings were made through banking channels like Pay Order/Crossed cheques/Account transfer/RTGS into supplier’s accounts through our customer. It is highly recommended that efforts be continued to maintain this percentage of direct payments in Murabaha transactions. Ensuring payment to the supplier from banking channels is encouraged as it is essential for financial inclusion and reducing undocumented trade culture.

It is worth mentioning that, in order to strengthen Shariah compliance, physical inspection of delivery of goods was carried out in almost all Istisna and Tijarah transactions.

# Liquidity Management

For the purpose of liquidity management, the Bank invested Rs 1.7 trillion in GoP Sukuk. With the increase in Sukuk issuance, the Bank has reduced its reliance on Bai Muajjal transactions, which stood at Rs 35 billion in December, 2024, in line with last year.

# Review of Deposits

It is heartening to see deposits grow by 16.6% to reach a sum of Rs 2,585 billion as of December 31, 2024. During the year, the process of allocation of assets and funds to various deposit pools, announcing overall profit-sharing ratios for Mudarabah-based deposits, monthly allocation of weightages, and distribution of income to deposit accounts were monitored and reviewed in accordance with the respective pool management guidelines of SBP and Meezan Bank.

# Shariah Audit

In compliance with the Shariah Governance Framework issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), a dedicated Shariah Audit Department, reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board, is in place. This department plays a significant role in accomplishing the objective of ensuring Shariah compliance by evaluating adherence to Shariah guidelines prescribed by the Shariah Board, Resident Shariah Board Member, and the Shariah guidelines of the Islamic Banking Shariah Audit Department of the SBP. This department submits its report to RSBM/SB for information, review and determination of appropriate corrective actions.

During the year under review, Shariah Audit of 949 branches, area offices, consumer, corporate hubs, and Head Office departments was conducted as a part of the Bank’s efforts to strengthen the internal Shariah controls mechanism. These audits not only covered the assessment of financial transactions and operational activities undertaken by the branches/departments but also include an evaluation of the staff’s knowledge of Islamic finance.

# Suggestions

For the purpose of further improving the business of the Bank and the overall Islamic Banking Industry, the following are our suggestions. Some of them are reiterated to emphasize the ongoing nature of these recommendations.

# Purpose of Existence

- It is emphasized that this message should be clearly communicated within the Bank that all the efforts that are being made for the growth of Islamic Banking should be driven by the primary objective of pleasing Allah (ﷻ).

# Grooming of Staff

- The Bank should continue its efforts to provide training on ethical and religious values along with job-related trainings to its employees.
- Since banking industry is undergoing a transformation and requires rigorous efforts from Bank’s personnel, therefore efforts should be made to focus on capacity enhancement of our staff so that they can guide their customers towards the right path.

# Conversion of Financial System

- Bank should find ways to offer support to different financial institutions towards conversion to Islamic financial system, especially micro finance institutions, brokerage houses, fintech, etc.
- Bank should also strive to reach out to its customers and support them in converting their financing needs towards Islamic financing.
- Being a Premier Islamic Bank, the Bank should continue to provide maximum support to the Government and State Bank of Pakistan for their efforts towards the Islamization of the financial system.
- The Bank, in its role as Joint Financial Advisor to Ministry of Finance, should strive to develop different types of Sukuk structures like Asset light Sukuk, Green Sukuk, Hybrid Sukuk, etc. to cater to various financing and investment needs of different sectors of society.
- The Bank, in its role as a Joint Financial Advisor to Ministry of Finance, should also look to explore and structure Sukuk transactions that promotes sustainable and socially responsive financing.

# Banking Outreach

- It is strongly advised that the Bank should continue its focus on increasing financing to SME sector and consider utilizing digital platform for this purpose. Agriculture sector is very important in the economy of Pakistan and it is suggested that the Bank should also strive to increase its footprint in the agriculture sector and should aim to create its leadership position in this area as well.
- The Bank should strive to make collaborations with different micro and nano-financing institutions and incubation centers to increase the reach of Islamic finance to this segment of society.

# Shariah Compliance Environment

- The Bank should explore different mediums to disseminate Islamic finance knowledge both among the staff and to the masses. In this regard, the Bank may make use of short videos, tutorials, podcasts, case studies, documentaries, animated videos, etc.
- In the current scenario of declining benchmark rate, the Bank should focus on bringing more efficiency and cost control in its systems and processes.
- The Bank should continue its focus on strengthening Shariah controls and fostering a culture of accountability for Shariah non-compliance to ensure Shariah compliance in all spheres of banking.

# Awareness

- The Bank should explore different ways to engage with its current and prospective customers through seminars, workshops, industry visits and addresses their concerns to bring them closer to Islamic banking.
- The Bank should continue to collaborate with different trade bodies and chambers to create awareness about Islamic banking among the business community.
- The Bank should continue its effort to arrange focused sessions for different segments of society, such as women, children, university students, media persons, journalists, etc.

# Conclusion

As per the Charter of the Bank, it is mandatory for the management and employees to ensure the application of Shariah principles and guidelines issued by the Shariah Board and Resident Shariah Board Member, and to ensure Shariah compliance in all activities of the Bank. The primary responsibility for ensuring Shariah compliance of the Bank’s operations thus lies with the Board of Directors and Executive Management.

Based on extensive reviews of sample cases for each class of transaction, related documentations, processes, profit distribution mechanism for the depositors by the SCD, as well as the review of Internal Shariah Audit and External Shariah Audit reports and Management’s representation in this regard, the Bank, in our opinion, has complied with the rules & principles of Islamic Shariah in light of the guidelines and directives given by the Shariah Board, Resident Shariah Board Member of Meezan Bank, and the guidelines issued by the Shariah Advisory Committee of the SBP related to Shariah compliance. The non-compliant income identified during the review is being transferred to the Charity Account through a well-defined system and is being utilized properly in accordance with the instructions of the SB.

Based on the strength and capacity of the full-fledged SCD and the policies and guidelines for Shariah compliance issued at the Bank, we are of the opinion that an effective mechanism is in place to ensure Shariah compliance in overall operations of the Bank.

MRTs Measurement of Current and Future Risks, and Performance Alignment for MRTS / MRCS The bank adopts a holistic approach to assess current and future risks including reporting lines to the CEO & DCEO, contributing to the final identification of MRTs and MRCs. For MRTs & MRCs, the Balanced Scorecard integrates significant quantitative Key Performance Indicators, ensuring a harmonious balance between profit objectives and risk management.

# Compensation Frameworks

The compensation frameworks for MRTs and MRCs are established to maintain a suitable equilibrium between fixed and variable remuneration. This takes into account several factors, including the following:

- Categorization as MRT/MRC
- Position within the organizational structure
- Roles and duties
- Alignment with risk (i.e., greater variable remuneration for higher assumed risks)
- Performance evaluation based on financial and non-financial objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs), incorporating risk-adjusted factors.

# Remuneration Independence of MRCs from Functions they Oversee

To ensure the independence of MRCs, their compensation and appraisal are designed to be completely independent of the business units they review. This independence helps in maintaining objectivity in their evaluation of risks and their recommendations for risk mitigation strategies.

# Government of Pakistan

# Advances Islamic Banking with Constitutional Amendment

To fast-track the conversion process of the conventional banking sector into Islamic banking, the Government has enacted the 26ᵗʰ Constitutional Amendment. The newly amended Article 38(f) now states: “Eliminate Riba completely before the first day of January 2028.” This marks a key milestone in the country’s ongoing efforts to align its financial system with Shariah principles.

# Notes to and Forming Part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

# 1 LEGAL STATUS AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

# 1.1

Meezan Bank Limited (the Bank) was incorporated in Pakistan on January 27, 1997, as a public limited company under the provisions of the repealed Companies Ordinance, 1984 (now the Companies Act, 2017), and its shares are quoted on the Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited. The Bank was registered as an ‘Investment Finance Company’ on August 8, 1997, and carried on the business of investment banking as permitted under SRO 585(I)/87 dated July 13, 1987, in accordance and in conformity with the principles of Islamic Shariah. A ‘Certificate of Commencement of Business' was issued to the Bank on September 29, 1997.

# 1.2

The Bank was granted a ‘Scheduled Islamic Commercial Bank’ license on January 31, 2002 and formally commenced operations as a Scheduled Islamic Commercial Bank with effect from March 20, 2002, on receiving notification in this regard from the State Bank of Pakistan (the SBP) under section 37 of the State Bank of Pakistan Act, 1956. Currently, the Bank is engaged in corporate, commercial, consumer, investment and retail banking activities.

# 1.3

The Bank was operating through one thousand and fifty one branches as at December 31, 2024 (2023: one thousand and four branches). Its registered office is at Meezan House, C-25, Estate Avenue, SITE, Karachi, Pakistan.

# 1.4

The VIS Credit Rating Company Limited (VIS) has reaffirmed the Bank's medium to long-term rating as 'AAA' and short-term rating as 'A1+' on June 28, 2024 (2023: 'AAA' and 'A1+' dated June 27, 2023).

# 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The Bank provides Islamic financing and related assets mainly through Murabaha, Istisna, Tijarah, Ijarah, Diminishing Musharakah, Running Musharakah, Bai Muajjal, Musawammah, Service Ijarah, Wakalah, Wakalah Tul Istithmar including under Islamic Export Refinance Scheme and various long term Islamic refinancing facilities of the State Bank of Pakistan respectively as briefly explained in note 6.6.

The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these unconsolidated financial statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilised and the appropriate portion of profit thereon. The income on such financing is recognised in accordance with the principles of Islamic Shariah. However, income, if any, received which does not comply with the principles of Islamic Shariah is recognised as charity payable if so directed by the Resident Shariah Board Member (RSBM) of the Bank.

The Bank believes that there is no significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, Insha'Allah. Therefore, the unconsolidated financial statements continue to be prepared on a going concern basis.

# 3 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

# 3.1

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards comprise of:

# 3.2

The SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 04 dated February 25, 2015 has clarified that the reporting requirements of IFAS 3, 'Profit and loss sharing on deposits' for Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services (IIFS) relating to annual, half yearly and quarterly financial statements would be notified by the SBP through issuance of specific instructions and uniform disclosure formats in consultation with IIFS.

# 3.4

The SECP through S.R.O. 56(1)/2016 dated January 28, 2016, has directed that the requirements of IFRS 10, 'Consolidated financial statements' are not applicable in case of investments by companies in mutual funds established under Trust Deed structure. Accordingly, implications of IFRS 10 in respect of investment in mutual funds are not considered in these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 3.5

Standards, interpretations of and amendments to the published accounting and reporting standards that are effective in the current year:

# 3.5.1

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2024 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any material effect on the Bank's operations and therefore not detailed in these unconsolidated financial statements except for IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments), the impacts of which are disclosed in note 6.1.3.

# 3.6

Standards, interpretations of and amendments to the published accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective:

# 3.6.1

The management is in the process of assessing the impact of these standards and amendments on the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank.

# 4 BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

# 4.1

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims which are stated at revalued amounts, investment classified at fair value through profit or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income, commitments in respect of certain foreign exchange contracts which are measured at fair value, staff retirement benefits and compensated absences which are carried at present value.

# 4.2

Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgments in application of its accounting policies. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Significant accounting estimates and areas where judgments were made by the management in the application of the material accounting policies are as follows:

- i) classification and credit loss allowance / provisioning against investments (notes 6.2.1, 6.2.4, 6.3 and 10);
- ii) classification and credit loss allowance / provisioning against Islamic financing and related assets (notes 6.2.1, 6.3 and 11.8.6);
- iii) accounting for defined benefit plan and compensated absences (notes 6.15, 6.16 and 40);
- iv) valuation and depreciation of property and equipment (notes 6.8.5, 6.21 and 12.2);
- v) valuation and amortisation of intangible assets (note 6.8.5, 6.21 and 14);
- vi) impairment of non-financial assets (note 6.21);
- vii) valuation of non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims (note 6.11 and 15.2.1);
- viii) assumption and estimation in recognition of provision for taxation (current and prior years) and deferred taxation (notes 6.10 and 36);

# 5 FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY

# 5.1

Items included in these unconsolidated financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Bank operates. These unconsolidated financial statements are presented in Pakistani Rupees, which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency.

# 5.2

Figures have been rounded off to the nearest thousand rupees unless otherwise stated.

# 6 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policies applied in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements are set out below. These are consistent with those applied to all the years presented except for changes mentioned in notes 6.1 and 6.1.2.

# 6.1 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

As directed by the SBP via BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 17, 2023, IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' is effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 (previously January 01, 2023) for banks having asset base of more than Rs. 500 billion as at December 31, 2022. Moreover, SBP has also issued application instructions on IFRS 9 for banks in Pakistan for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard in the banks.

IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of accounting for financial liabilities. To determine appropriate classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments, to be assessed based on combination of the entity's business model for managing the assets and the instruments' contractual cash flow characteristics. The adoption of IFRS 9 has also fundamentally changed the impairment method of financial assets with a forward-looking Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach.

The SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No.16 dated July 29, 2024 and BPRD Circular Letter No.01 dated January 25, 2025 (Letters) has made certain amendments and clarified the timelines of some of the SBP's IFRS 9 Application Instructions to address the matters raised by the banks to ensure compliance by the timelines. The Letters have provided clarifications / relaxations on measurement of unquoted equity securities, modification accounting, maintenance of general provisions over and above expected credit loss allowance (ECL), accounting methodology for Islamic Banking Institutions and treatment of charity. Accordingly, the Bank has adopted the treatment as instructed in the aforementioned Letters in these unconsolidated financial statements. In addition, the SBP in a separate instructions BPRD/RPD/822456/25 dated January 22, 2025 has allowed extension for application of Effective Profit Rate up to December 31, 2025.

On application of IFRS 9, certain accounting policies have been revised to comply with the requirements of IFRS 9. The revised accounting policies have been disclosed in their respective policy notes in these unconsolidated financial statements.

The SBP has directed the Banks through its BPRD Circular Letter No.1 dated January 22, 2025 to disclose the impact of IFRS 9 on revenue recognition from Islamic Operations which is as follows:

Had IFRS 9 been adopted in its entirety for revenue recognition from Islamic operations profit / return earned on Islamic financing and related assets in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account for the year ended December 31, 2024 would have been higher by Rs. 907.35 million and taxation would have been higher by Rs 489.97 million. Further, an unappropriated profit in unconsolidated statement of changes in equity would have been higher by Rs 5,186 million.

# 6.1.1 Application to the Bank's financial assets

Debt based financial assets held by the Bank include: Islamic financing and related assets, investments in federal government securities and other government / private sukuks, due from financial institutions, cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks, and other financial assets.

# Notes to and Forming Part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

a) Financial assets are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as at FVTPL:

- the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and profit on the principal amount outstanding.

The Bank’s business model for these financial assets can still be hold to collect (HTC) even when sales of these financial assets occur. However, if more than an infrequent number of sale of significant value are made, the Bank assesses whether and how the sales are consistent with the HTC objective. This assessment includes the reasons for the sales, the expected frequency of sales, and whether the assets that are sold are held for an extended period of time relative to their contractual maturities.

b) Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) only if it meets both of the following conditions and are not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and profit on the principal amount outstanding.

c) Financial assets, if held for trading purposes are measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

The application of these policies also resulted in classifications and consequent remeasurements of certain investments in GoP Ijarah sukuk held under available for sale portfolio as at December 31, 2023 based on business model. Moreover, the Bank's investment in sub-ordinated sukuks issued by other Banks under available for sale portfolio as of December 31, 2023 have been reclassified to FVTPL since they do not pass the solely payments of principal and profit (SPPI) criteria due to equity conversion features embedded in the terms of these sukuks. Additionally, the Bank has elected to classify its investments in Islamic Naya Pakistan Certificates (previously classified under Available for Sale portfolio) as at January 31, 2024 at FVTPL.

The following table reconciles their carrying amounts as reported on December 31, 2023 to the carrying amounts under IFRS 9 on transition to IFRS 9 on January 01, 2024:

|Investment type and category|Balances as at December 31, 2023 (Audited)|Remeasurements|Balances as at January 01, 2024| |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|IFRS 9 Classification|Balances as at December 31, 2023| | | |
|- Federal Government Sukuks - AFS|FVOCI|1,067,226,357|4,931,129|1,072,157,486|
| |FVTPL|10,473,351|-|10,473,351|
| |Amortised cost|124,801,022|-|124,801,022|
|- Non Government Sukuks - AFS|FVOCI|134,442,257|-|134,442,257|
| |FVTPL|1,083,000|-|1,083,000|

Equity based financial assets

Equity instruments are instruments that meet the definition of equity from the issuer's perspective; that is, instruments that do not contain a contractual obligation to pay and that evidence a residual share in the issuer's net assets.

The Bank measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), except where the Bank's management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Bank's policy is to designate the equity investments as FVOCI when those investments are held for purposes other than for trading. When this election is used, fair value gains and losses are recognised in the unconsolidated Annual Report 2024.

# Notes to and Forming Part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

Statement of other comprehensive income and are not subsequently reclassified to the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account, including on disposal. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return on such investments, continue to be recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account as income when the Bank's right to receive payments is established.

Unquoted equity instruments can be measured at lower of cost or breakup value till December 31, 2024 as per the BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024. However, the Bank has early adopted fair valuation policy for its investment in unquoted equity instruments whose fair value can reliably be determined and accordingly, the Bank has reversed the provision in respect of unquoted equity instruments amounting to Rs 64.77 million.

IFRS 9 has eliminated impairment assessment requirements for investments in equity instruments. Accordingly, the Bank has reversed impairment of Rs 2,562 million on equity investment held as at December 31, 2023 and the same has been transferred to deficit on revaluation of investments through remeasurements.

Gains and losses on equity instruments at FVTPL are recognised in the ‘Gain / (loss) on securities’ in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# The measurement category and carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan before and after adoption of IFRS 9 as at January 1, 2024 are compared as follows:

# 6.1.2 Adoption of new formats for the preparation of financial statements

The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 02 dated February 09, 2023 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 dated April 13, 2023, issued the revised formats of the annual / interim financial statements which are applicable for the preparation of annual financial statements, periods beginning on or after January 01, 2024 (previously January 01, 2023). The implementation of the revised formats has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the financial statements. The significant change is that the right of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities against right-of-use assets are now presented separately on the face of statement of financial position. Previously, these were presented under property and equipment (previously titled fixed assets) and other liabilities respectively. As a result of this change, the property and equipment of the Bank decreased by Rs. 20,941 million and Rs. 19,572 million as December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively.

by Rs. 25,848 million and Rs. 21,230 as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively. There is no impact of this change on the unconsolidated financial statements in terms of recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities. The Bank has adopted the above changes in the presentation and made additional disclosures to the extent applicable to its operations and corresponding figures have been rearranged / reclassified to correspond to current year presentation, as presented in note 52.

# 6.1.3

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 effective January 01, 2024 with modified retrospective approach as permitted under IFRS 9. The cumulative impact of initial application of Rs 1,214.150 million has been recorded as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of the current accounting year.

# Notes to and Forming Part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

# 6.2 Financial assets and liabilities

# 6.2.1 Classification

Financial assets

Under IFRS 9, existing categories of financial assets: Held for Trading (HFT), Available for Sale (AFS) and Held to Maturity (HTM) and loans and receivables have been replaced by:

- Financial assets at amortised cost
- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss account (FVTPL)

Financial liabilities

Under IFRS 9, the accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus all financial liabilities are being carried at amortised cost. Financial liabilities can also be designated at FVTPL where gains or losses arising from entity's own credit rating risk are required to be presented in other comprehensive income with no reclassification to profit and loss account.

# 6.2.2 Business model assessment

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Bank's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity's key management personnel;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank’s assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Bank's original expectations, the Bank does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.

Securities held for trading are held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term or are part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. These securities are classified in the 'other' business model and measured at FVTPL.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:

1. Hold to Collect (HTC) Business Model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash flows.
2. Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S) Business Model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
3. Other Business Models: Resulting in classification of financial assets as FVTPL.

# 6.2.3 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and profit (SPPI)

As a second step of its classification process, the Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. ‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium / discount). The most significant elements of profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgment and considers relevant.

# Notes to and Forming Part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

Factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the profit rate is set. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with basic financing arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL.

# 6.2.3.1 Debt instruments previously classified as available for sale but which fail the SPPI test

The Bank holds a portfolio of debt instruments that failed to meet the 'solely payments of principal and profit' (SPPI) requirement for amortised cost and FVOCI classification under IFRS 9. These instruments contain provisions that, in certain circumstances, allow the issuer to fully convert the instrument into common shares or the issuer can also exercise the call option with prior approval of the SBP. This clause breaches the criterion that profit payments should only be consideration for credit risk and the time value of money on the principal. As a result, these instruments were classified as FVTPL from the date of initial application as mentioned in the note 6.1.3.

# 6.2.4 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Bank purchase or sell the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like Islamic financing and related assets, due from financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account or financial institutions or as per underlying Shariah mode. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased. The Bank will recognise due to customer and financial institution balances when these funds reach the Bank.

# a) Amortised cost (AC)

Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and profit ('SPPl), and that are not designated at FVTPL, are measured at amortised cost. Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Rental / profit income / dividend income / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, gain / (loss) is recognised in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and profit, and that are not designated at FVTPL, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. They are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in unconsolidated statement of other comprehensive income. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for these financial assets in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Rental / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / (loss) will be recognised in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account only in case of debt instruments. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / (loss) is transferred from surplus / deficit on revaluations of assets to unappropriated profit.

# c) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. They are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost is directly recorded in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Rental / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss is recognised in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

# 6.2.5 Derecognition

Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive the cash.
---
# Notes to and Forming Part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

flows from the assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and either (i) the Bank transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or (ii) the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and the Bank has not retained control.

The Bank enters into transactions where it retains the contractual rights to receive cash flows from assets but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to other entities and transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards. These transactions are accounted for as 'pass through' transfers that result in derecognition if the Bank:

1. Has no obligation to make payments unless it collects equivalent amounts from the assets;
2. Is prohibited from selling or pledging the assets; and
3. Has an obligation to remit any cash it collects from the assets without material delay.

Collateral (shares and sukuks) furnished by the Bank under due from institutions are not derecognised because the Bank retains substantially all the risks and rewards on the basis of the predetermined repurchase price, and the criteria for derecognition are therefore not met.

# Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are derecognised when these are extinguished (i.e. when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires).

The exchange between the Bank and its original participants of debt instruments with substantially different terms, as well as substantial modifications of the terms of existing financial liabilities, are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The terms are substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net of any fees received and discounted using the original effective interest rate, is at least 10% different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. In addition, other qualitative factors, such as the currency that the instrument is denominated in, changes in the type of profit rate, new conversion features attached to the instrument and change in covenants are also taken into consideration.

If an exchange of debt instruments or modification of terms is accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the extinguishment. If the exchange or modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified liability.

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# Modification

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of financing to its customers. When the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified and the renegotiation or modification does not result in the derecognition of that financial asset (that is terms are not substantially different) in accordance with IFRS 9, the Bank recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset and shall recognise a modification gain or loss in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. The gross carrying amount of the financial asset is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial asset’s original approximate effective profit rate (or approximate credit-adjusted effective profit rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets). Any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

If the terms are substantially different, the Bank derecognises the original financial asset and recognised a 'new' asset at fair value and recalculates a new approximate to effective profit rate for the asset. The date of renegotiation is consequently considered to be the date of initial recognition for credit loss allowance calculation purposes, including for the purpose of determining whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. Gain / loss on derecognition of such financial asset is recognised in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# 6.2.7 Financial guarantee contracts

Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Such financial guarantees are given to banks, financial institutions and others on behalf of customers to secure loans, overdrafts and other banking facilities.

Financial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of:

- The amount of the loss allowance;
- The premium received on initial recognition less income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.

# 6.3 Overview of the expected credit loss allowance (ECL) principles

The Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss allowance ('ECL') associated with Islamic financing and related assets and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and irrevocable unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Bank recognises a credit loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- The time value of money; and
- Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ or remaining maturity, whichever is lower, expected credit loss (12mECL) as outlined below.

The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months or remaining maturity after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

Effective profit rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

The Bank has identified basis of ECL computation for following stages:

- Stage 1: No significant deterioration in credit quality of financial asset - 12 month expected credit loss.
- Stage 2: Significant deterioration in credit quality of financial asset since recognition - lifetime expected credit loss.
- Stage 3: Credit impaired - impairment determined on individual or collective basis over the lifetime.

The staging guidelines applicable on the Bank has been adopted from the application instructions of IFRS - 9 issued by the SBP vide its BPRD circular 3 of 2022.

|Particular|Classification|Days due|Stage allocation under IFRS 9|Provisions to be made|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Prudential regulation for corporate|Performing|1-59|Stage 1|As per IFRS 9 ECL modelling|
| |Under-performing|60-89|Stage 2| |
| |Non-performing:|90-179|Stage 3|Whichever is higher:|
| |Substandard| | |a) IFRS 9 ECL or|
| |Doubtful|180 or more days| |b) PR's requirement|
| |Loss|one year or more| | |

# Definition of default

The concept of “impairment” or “default” is critical to the implementation of IFRS 9 as it drives determination of risk parameters i.e PD and LGD.

SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022 dated July 5, 2022 has prescribed objective basis, based on Days Past Due, for classification of financing in stage 3. In addition to time based criteria, SBP requires Banks to evaluate and, where required, subjectively classify or further downgrade classification of financing. ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at Customer /Obligor/ facility level for corporate / commercial / SME / Agri Financing portfolios and at segment / product basis for retail portfolio as prescribed by SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024.

# Write-offs

The Bank’s accounting policy under IFRS 9 remains the same as it was under SBP regulations / existing reporting framework. Financing written off in accordance with the policy do not in any way prejudice the Bank's right of recovery from the customer.

# 6.4 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash in hand, balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks in current and deposit accounts, national prize bonds, overdrawn nostro accounts, placements and investments having original maturity of three months or less.

# 6.5 Due to / from financial institutions

# Bai Muajjal

In Bai Muajjal, the Bank sells sukuk on credit to other financial institutions. The credit price is agreed at the time of sale and such proceeds are received at the end of the credit period. Bai Muajjal with the Federal Government is classified as investment.

# Musharaka / Mudaraba

In Musharaka / Mudaraba, the Bank (or the counterparty financial institutions / the SBP) invests in the shariah compliant business pools of the counterparty financial institutions / the SBP (or the Bank) at the agreed profit and loss sharing ratio.

# Musharaka from the SBP under IERS

Under IERS, the Bank accepts funds from the SBP under Shirkat-ul-aqd to constitute a pool for investment in export refinance portfolio of the Bank under the guidelines issued by the SBP. The profit of the pool is shared as per the agreed weightages between the partners.

# Mudaraba investment from the SBP under various long term Islamic refinance schemes

Under various long term Islamic refinance schemes of the SBP, the Bank accepts funds from the SBP which are received on Mudaraba basis for investment in general pool of the Bank. The profit of the pool is shared as per the announced profit sharing ratio of the pool and the weightages assigned to these investments.

The mudaraba investments from the SBP are initially recognised at amount of funds accepted except for an investment from SBP under Islamic Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (ITERF).

The Islamic Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (ITERF) mudaraba investment from the SBP is recorded at present value on initial recognition discounted at market rate. The difference between the fair value of the financial liability and the amount accepted is recognised as gain / (loss) in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Unwinding of an expense on fair value adjustment is also recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# 6.6 Islamic financing and related assets

# Murabaha

In Murabaha transactions, the Bank purchases the goods and after taking the possession, sells them to the customer on cost plus disclosed profit basis either in a spot or credit transaction.

# Ijarah

Ijarah assets are stated at cost less depreciation and are disclosed as part of 'Islamic financing and related assets'. The rental received / receivable on Ijarah under Islamic Financial Accounting Standard - 2 ‘Ijarah’ (IFAS 2) are recorded as income / revenue. The Bank charges depreciation from the date of recognition of Ijarah of respective assets to mustajir. Ijarah assets are depreciated over the period of Ijarah using the straight line method. Ijarah rentals outstanding are disclosed in 'other assets' on the Statement of Financial Position at amortised cost. Impairment of Ijarah assets is determined in accordance with the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP. The provision for impairment of Ijarah assets is shown as part of 'Islamic financing and related assets'.

# Istisna

In Istisna financing, the Bank places an order to purchase some specific goods / commodities from its customers to be delivered to the Bank within an agreed time. The goods are then sold by the customer on behalf of the Bank and the amount hence financed along with profit realised net of agency fee and incentives is paid to the Bank.

# Tijarah

In Tijarah financing, the Bank purchases specific goods / commodities on cash basis from its customers which is then onward sold by the customer on behalf of the Bank and on subsequent sale, the financed amount along with profit realised net of agency fee and incentives is paid by the customer to the Bank.

# Diminishing Musharakah

In Diminishing Musharakah financing, the Bank enters into Musharakah based on Shirkat-ul-milk for purchasing an agreed share of fixed asset (e.g. house, land, plant or machinery) with its customers. The customers pay periodic profit as per the agreement for the utilisation of the Bank's Musharakah share and also periodically purchase the Bank's share over the tenure of the transaction.

However, the Diminishing Musharakah financing disbursed under Islamic Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (ITERF) and under staff financing policy is recorded at fair value on initial recognition discounted at prevailing market rate. The difference between the fair value of the financial asset and the amount disbursed is recorded as gain / (loss) and unwinding of income on fair value adjustment is recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# Running Musharakah

In Running Musharakah financing, the Bank enters into financing with the customer based on Shirkatul Aqd or business partnership in the customer's operating business. Under this mechanism, the customer can withdraw and return funds to the Bank subject to his Running Musharakah financing limit during the Musharakah period. At the end of each quarter / half year the customer pays the provisional profit as per the desired profit rate which is subject to final settlement based on the relevant quarterly / half yearly / annual accounts of the customer.

# Bai Muajjal

In Bai Muajjal financing, the Bank sells Shariah compliant sukuk on credit to customers. The credit price is agreed at the time of sale and such proceeds are received at the end of the credit period.

# Service Ijarah

In Service Ijarah financing, the Bank provides financing by acquiring certain agreed services from the customer. After the purchase of services, the Bank appoints the customer to sell these services in the market over a period and provide a sale confirmation of such sale. The profit is only accrued from the date of receipt of such confirmation.

# Wakalah

Wakalah is an agency or a delegated authority where the Muwakkil (principal) appoints the Wakil (agent) to carry out a specific job on behalf of the Muwakkil. Funds disbursed are initially recorded as ‘Advance against Wakalah'. On culmination, the same are recorded as financings.

# Wakalah tul Istithmar

In Wakalah tul Istithmar financing, the Bank enters into investment agency transaction with customer acting as an agent of the Bank. Under this mechanism, the funds disbursed are invested by the customer on behalf of the Bank and are recorded as financing upon their investment in the business.

# Musawammah

In Musawammah financing, the Bank purchases the goods and after taking the possession, sells them to the customer either in spot or credit transaction, without disclosing the cost.

# 6.6 Financing Arrangements

# 6.6.1 Funds Disbursed

Funds disbursed, under financing arrangements for purchase of goods / assets are recorded as an advance. On culmination, financing are recorded at the deferred sale price net of profit. Goods purchased but remaining unsold at the unconsolidated statement of financial position date are recorded as inventories as disclosed in note 6.6.3.

# 6.6.2 Credit Loss Allowance / Provision

Credit loss allowance / provision against non-performing Islamic financing and related assets Islamic financing and related assets are stated net of credit loss allowance / provision held against non-performing Islamic financing and related assets in accordance with the requirements of the Prudential Regulations and IFRS 9 application instructions issued by the SBP as disclosed in note 6.3 which are charged to the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. In addition to the above the Bank has also maintained a general provision in respect of financing against potential losses as may be present in the portfolio as disclosed in note 11.8. This provision is based on management's best estimate and is approved by the Board of Directors of the Bank. The net ECL / provision made / reversed during the year is charged to the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account and accumulated ECL / provision is netted off against Islamic financing and related assets. Islamic financing and related assets are written off when there are no realistic prospects of recovery.

# 6.6.3 Inventories

The Bank values its inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost necessary to make the sale. Cost of inventories represents actual purchases made by the Bank / customers as an agent of the Bank for subsequent sale. Inventory against each contract is maintained on specific identification method.

# 6.7 Investments

Investments include Federal Government securities, shares, units of mutual funds, non-Government sukuks, foreign securities, associates and subsidiaries. Classification and measurement of Investments have been disclosed in note 6.2.

# 6.7.1 Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Bank has significant influence but not control. Certain mutual funds are managed by the subsidiary company of the Bank and hence, the Bank has significant influence over such funds and therefore, investment in these mutual funds are considered as investment in associates in these unconsolidated financial statements. Investment in associates is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

# 6.7.2 Subsidiary

Subsidiary is an entity over which the Bank has control. Investment in subsidiaries are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

# 6.7.3 Impairment of Investment in Associates and Subsidiaries

In respect of investment in associates and subsidiaries, the Bank reviews their carrying values at each reporting date to assess whether there is an indication of impairment. The amount of impairment loss would be determined based on the higher of value in use and fair value less cost to sell. Impairment loss is recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# 6.7.4 Regular Way Contracts

All purchases and sales of investments that require delivery within the time frame established by regulation or market convention are recognised at the trade date, which is the date on which the Bank commits to purchase or sell the investments.

# 6.8 Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets

# 6.8.1 Property and Equipment

They are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any identified impairment loss. Items of property and equipment costing Rs 25,000 or less are not capitalised and are charged off in the month of purchase. An item of property and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Profit or loss on disposal of property and equipment is included in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# Notes to and Forming Part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

# 6.8.2 Capital work-in-progress

Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. All expenditures connected with specific assets incurred during installation and construction period are carried under this head. These are transferred to specific assets as and when assets become available for use.

# 6.8.3 Intangible assets

Intangible assets comprise of computer software. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses (if any).

# 6.8.4 Subsequent costs related to property and equipment and intangible assets

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amounts or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance expenditure are charged to the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account as and when incurred.

# 6.8.5 Depreciation / amortisation related to property and equipment and intangible assets

Depreciation / amortisation is charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account by applying the straight line method in accordance with the rates specified in notes 12.2 and 14.1 whereby the depreciable value of an asset is written off over its estimated service life. The Bank charges depreciation / amortisation from the month of acquisition and up to the month preceding the disposal. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term specified in note 13.

# 6.8.6 Useful lives and residual values related to property and equipment and intangible assets

Useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted, if impact on depreciation / amortisation is significant.

# 6.9 Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities

# Right-of-use assets

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any reassessment of lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The right-of-use assets are subject to impairment in line with the Bank’s policy as described in note 6.21.

# Lease liabilities

At the inception of the contract, the Bank assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. The Bank applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Bank recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

At the commencement date of the lease, the Bank recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The Bank determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. After the commencement date, the Bank reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control that affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. The Bank cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental fund acceptance rate to measure lease liabilities.

# Incremental fund acceptance rate

The Incremental fund acceptance rate is the rate of profit that the Bank would have to pay to accept its fund over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.

# 6.10 Taxation

Income tax expense comprises of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Annual Report 2024

# Notes to and Forming Part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

# Current

The charge for current taxation is based on expected taxable income for the year in accordance with the prevailing laws of taxation. The charge for current tax also includes adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years including those arising from assessments finalised during the year and are separately disclosed.

# Prior years

This charge includes tax charge for prior years arising from assessments, changes in estimates and change in law.

# Deferred

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the temporary differences relating to initial recognition of goodwill, initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profits and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realised.

In making the estimates for current and deferred taxes, the management considers the income tax law and the decisions of appellate authorities on certain issues in the past.

# 6.11 Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

The non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation. The useful lives are reviewed annually and adjusted, if appropriate. These assets are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. Surplus arising on revaluation of property, if any, is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of assets' account in the statement of other comprehensive income. Any deficit arising on revaluation is taken to unconsolidated profit and loss account directly. On derecognition of the assets, the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to unappropriated profit in the unconsolidated statement of changes in equity. Legal fees, transfer cost and direct cost of acquiring title to property is charged to the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# 6.12 Deposits

Deposits are generated on the basis of two modes i.e. Qard and Mudaraba.

Deposits taken on Qard basis are classified as 'Current accounts' and Deposits generated on Mudaraba basis are classified as 'Savings deposits' and 'Fixed deposits'. No profit or loss is passed on to current account depositors, however the funds of current accounts are treated as equity for the purpose of profit calculation and any profit earned / loss incurred on those funds are allocated to the equity of the Bank. While the product features of each product differ, there is usually no restriction on withdrawals or number of transactions in current and savings accounts. In case of fixed deposits, pre-mature withdrawals can be made as per approved terms only.

Profits realised in investment pools are distributed in pre-agreed profit sharing ratio between Rab-ul-Maal and Mudarib. Rab-ul-Maal share is distributed among depositors according to weightages assigned at the inception of the profit calculation period. Mudarib can distribute its share of profit to Rab-ul-Maal as Incentive profits (Hiba). Profits are distributed from the pool such that the depositors (remunerative) only bear the risk of assets in the pool during the profit calculation period.

# 6.14 Pool Management

The Bank operates general and specific pools for deposits and inter-bank funds accepted / acquired under Mudaraba and Musharakah modes.

Under the general deposits pools, the Bank accepts funds on Mudaraba basis from depositors (Rab-ul-Maal) where the Bank acts as Manager (Mudarib) and invests the funds in the Shariah Compliant modes of financing, investments and placements. When utilising investing funds, the Bank prioritizes the funds received from depositors over the funds generated from own sources after meeting the regulatory requirement relating to such deposits.

Specific pools are operated for funds acquired / accepted from the State Bank of Pakistan and other banks for Islamic Export Refinance to the Bank's customers and liquidity management respectively under the Musharakah / Mudaraba modes.

The profit of each deposit pool is calculated on all the remunerative assets booked by utilising the funds from the pool after deduction of expenses directly incurred in earning the income of such pool along with related fee income, if any. The directly related costs comprise of depreciation on ijarah assets, takaful premium, documentation charges etc. No expense of general or administrative nature is charged to the pools. No provision against any non-performing asset of the pool is passed on to the pool except on the actual loss / write-off of such non-performing asset. The profit of the pool is shared between equity and other members of the pool on the basis of Musharakah at gross level (before charging of mudarib fee) as per the investment ratio of the equity. The profit of the pool is shared among the members of the pool on pre-defined mechanism based on the weightages announced before the profit calculation period after charging of mudarib fee. During the year, the Bank has given General Hiba to the depositors of General Pools, keeping in view the prescribed guidelines of Pool Management provided by the SBP and with the approval of the Bank's Resident Shariah Board Member. However, Hiba are given at the sole discretion of the Bank without any contractual commitment and can be withdrawn or reduced by the Bank at its sole discretion.

In the amended order for tax year 2015, additional issues with respect to the taxability of gain on bargain purchase, non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East – Pakistan Branches and the levy of super tax were also raised. The matter has been decided in Bank's favour by Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue. Both the Bank and the tax department filed a reference with the High Court of Sindh in respect of the aforementioned matters.

The management of the Bank, in consultation with its tax advisors, is confident that the decision in respect of the above matters would be in Bank’s favour and accordingly no provision has been made in these unconsolidated financial statements with respect thereto. The additional tax liability in respect of gain on bargain purchase and non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East – Pakistan Branches is Rs 1,096 million and Rs 706 million respectively.

# 40.7

The plan assets and defined benefit obligations (in respect of the Gratuity Funded Scheme) are based in Pakistan.

# 40.8 Principal actuarial assumptions

| |2024|2023|
|---|---|---|
|Discount rate|12.25% p.a|14.75% p.a|
|Expected rate of increase in salaries|13.25% p.a|14.75% p.a|
|Expected rate of return on investments|12.25% p.a|14.75% p.a|
|Normal retirement age|60 years|60 years|

# 40.9

Assumptions regarding future mortality are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience in Pakistan. The rates assumed are based on the adjusted SLIC 2001 - 2005 mortality tables.

# 40.10 The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:

|Change in assumption|Impact on defined benefit obligation - Increase / (Decrease)| |December 31, 2024| |December 31, 2023| |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Discount rate 1.00%| | |(595,794)|693,568|(492,387)|579,251|
|Salary growth rate 1.00%| | |712,070|(622,049)|596,630|(514,709)|
|Withdrawal rate 10.00%| | |(22,529)|23,911|(5)|5|

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the gratuity liability recognised within the unconsolidated Statement of Financial Position.

# 40.11

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 9.60 years.

# 40.12 Expected maturity analysis of undiscounted defined benefit obligation for the Gratuity Funded Scheme is as follows:

| |Less than a year|Between 1-2 years|Between 2-5 years|Over 5 years|Total|

# Notes to and Forming Part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

40.13 Funding levels are monitored on an annual basis and are based on actuarial recommendations. Contribution for the next year works out to Rs 1,692.584 million as per the actuarial valuation report of the Bank as of December 31, 2024.

40.14 Through its Gratuity Funded Scheme, the Fund is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:

- Asset volatility: The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate sukuk yields; if plan assets underperform to the yield, this will create a deficit. The Fund believes that due to long-term nature of the plan liabilities and the Bank's support, the current investment strategy manages this risk adequately.
- Changes in sukuk yields: A decrease in corporate sukuk yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans' sukuk holdings.
- Inflation risk: The majority of the plans' benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. However plan assets are variable rate instruments and are re-priced at regular intervals to offset inflationary impacts.
- Life expectancy / Withdrawal rate: The majority of the plans' obligations are to provide benefits on severance with the Bank on achieving retirement. Any change in life expectancy / withdrawal rate would impact plan liabilities.

40.15 End of Service Unfunded Defined Benefit Scheme

The Bank also operates an End of Service Unfunded Defined Benefit Scheme for the founding President and Chief Executive Officer. The scheme was introduced in 2015 and the benefits under the scheme is linked to last drawn compensation and years of service with the Bank.

The charge in respect of current service cost is recognised based on expected period of future service. The net charge for the year of this benefit amounted to Rs 144.98 million (2023: Rs 134.14 million). The charge of Rs 126.08 million (2023: Rs 98.71 million) has been recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account and the charge of Rs 18.88 million (2023: Rs 35.43 million) has been recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. The present value of defined benefit obligation recognised in respect of this scheme amounts to Rs 808.53 million (2023: Rs 663.57 million).

The principal actuarial assumptions comprise of discount rate of 12.25 percent and salary increase rate of 11.75 percent. The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation due to a one percent change in discount rate would be Rs 6.55 million (in case the discount rate is increased) and Rs 6.66 million (in case the discount rate is decreased). These sensitivities are calculated using the same methodology as explained in note 40.10.

40.16 The disclosures made in notes 40.1 to 40.15 are based on the information included in the actuarial valuation reports of the Bank as of December 31, 2024.

# 41 DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

The Bank also operates a recognised contributory provident fund for all permanent employees. Equal monthly contributions are made, both by the Bank and the employees, to the fund at a rate of 10% of basic salary.

| |2024|2023|
|---|---|---|
|Contribution from the Bank|856,545|674,262|
|Contribution from the employees|856,545|674,262|

# 44 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as amortised cost / held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted debt securities classified as amortised cost / held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of valuation methodologies. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term financings, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and due to financial institutions cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer financings and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 44.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured as at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised.

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Listed Securities|The valuation has been determined through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange.|
|GoP Ijarah Sukuks|The fair value of GoP Ijarah sukuks listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange has been determined through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange. The fair value of other GoP Ijarah sukuks are derived using PKISRV rates. The PKISRV rates are announced by FMA (Financial Market Association) through Reuters. The rates announced are simple average of quotes received from eight different pre-defined / approved dealers / brokers.|
|Foreign Sukuks|These are measured at fair value using the rates published by the valuation expert (Bloomberg).|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mid rates announced by SBP.|
|Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in these unconsolidated financial statements of the bank for the year ended December 31, 2024.|
|Units of mutual funds|The valuation has been determined based on net asset values (NAV) declared by respective funds. The value of unquoted equity securities are determined by using different methods for different securities.|
|Unquoted Equity Securities|Fair value of investment in Sapphire Electric Company Limited has been determined by Dividend Discount Model (DDM) by using constant dividends streams of the entity by using various key assumptions considering economic and market conditions. Key assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate (if applicable).|
|Corporate sukuks|The valuation has been determined through closing rates announced by FMA (Financial Market Association) through Reuters.|

The Bank's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the year.

The valuation of non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims, mentioned above, is conducted by the valuation expert appointed by the Bank which is also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation expert uses a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank's non-banking asset acquired in satisfaction of claims. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. This value is adjusted to reflect the current condition of the property. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuation cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these unconsolidated financial statements.

The reconciliation from the opening balance to the closing balance of the non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims has been disclosed in note 15.2.1. The change in the market value has been accounted for in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

The sensitivity analysis of the fair value measurement of unquoted equity securities due to changes in observable inputs has not been disclosed as the amount is not material and significant.

# 48 CAPITAL ASSESSMENT AND ADEQUACY BASEL SPECIFIC

# Capital structure

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) introduced updated guidelines with respect to disclosure of capital adequacy related information in the financial statements of banks vide its communication dated November 5, 2014. These guidelines are based on the requirements of Basel III which were introduced earlier by the SBP in August 2013 for implementation by banks in Pakistan. The SBP had specified a transitional period for implementing new standards which came to its end on December 31, 2019. The disclosures below have been prepared on the basis of these new guidelines. The comparative information is as per requirements which were applicable last year.

# 48.1 Capital structure

Under Basel III framework, the Bank's regulatory capital has been analysed into two tiers as follows:

- Tier 1 capital (going concern capital) which is sub divided into:
- a) Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), which includes fully paid up capital, balance in share premium account, statutory and general reserves, and un-appropriated profits (net of losses), after regulatory deductions for book value of intangibles, reciprocal cross holdings, investment in own shares.
- b) Additional Tier 1 capital (AT1), which includes perpetual, unsecured, subordinated, non-cumulative and contingent convertible Sukuk instrument issued by the Bank.
- Tier II capital, which includes sub-ordinated sukuks, general provisions for financing losses (up to a maximum of 1.25% of credit risk weighted assets) and surplus on revaluation of assets - net of tax.

Banking operations are categorised in either the trading book or the banking book and risk weighted assets are determined according to the specified requirements that seek to reflect the varying levels of risk attached to assets and off balance sheet exposures. The required capital adequacy ratio is achieved by the Bank through:

- (a) Adequate level of paid up capital;
- (b) Adequate risk profile of asset mix;
- (c) Ensuring better recovery management; and
- (d) Maintaining acceptable profit margins.

# 48.2 Capital adequacy ratio

The main objective of the capital management is to improve the financial position and strengthen the statement of financial position of the Bank to support the growth in business, provide protection to depositors and enhance shareholders' value. The Bank’s Board and the management is committed to maintaining a sound balance between depositors' liability and shareholders' funds so that optimal capital / debt ratio is maintained. The optimal capital / debt ratio will provide reasonable assurance to depositor's about safety and security of their funds and at the same time provide impetus to the management to invest their depositors’ funds into profitable ventures without compromising the risk profile of the Bank. The capital requirement of the Bank has been determined based on the projected growth plan to be achieved in the next 3 years in all areas of business operations.

The Bank prepares Annual Budget and Three Year Plan for purpose of the growth map and future direction. Bottom up approach is used to prepare annual budget and detailed deliberations are held while preparing Three Year Plan. The growth prospects takes into consideration prevailing economic and political factors in Pakistan and abroad.

In implementing current capital requirements the State Bank of Pakistan requires banks to maintain minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 11.50% as of December 31, 2024 whereas CAR stood at 20.35% as of December 31, 2024. The Bank calculates risk weighted assets for credit risk, market risk and operational risk based upon requirements under Basel Accord as per guidelines issued by the State Bank of Pakistan from time to time in this regard.

Sensitivity and stress testing of the Bank under different risk factors namely yield rate, forced sale value of collateral, non-performing financings and foreign exchange rate depicts that the Bank’s capital adequacy ratio is above the regulatory requirements. The Bank has taken into account credit risk, market risk and operational risk when planning its assets.

# 50 RISK MANAGEMENT

Economic fundamentals improved and political uncertainty showed a decline during 2024. Stability in FX reserves, exchange rate and decline in policy rate were the major contributor to the overall improvement in economic situation. During the year, SBP decreased the benchmark interest rate by a cumulative 900 bps to 13%. This steep decrease was due to decline in headline inflation to 4.1% only in Dec 2024 resulting in ample cushion for SBP to focus on monetary easing. Stock market showed robust growth as benchmark index grow by 84% in 2024. However, fiscal policy remains a key challenge for the government to generate additional revenue. Sustainable fiscal measures along with external support from IMF and other sources will be the key determinant for the economy in the future.

# Notes to and Forming Part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

The Bank is regularly conducting assessments of the credit portfolio, with robust post disbursement credit review mechanism to identify borrowers most likely to be affected in the challenging business and economic environment. Bank is confident that it has more than sufficient risk bearing capacity to withstand these difficult times.

The wide variety of the Bank’s business activities require the Bank to identify, assess, measure, aggregate and manage risks effectively which are constantly evolving as the business activities expand in response to the Bank's strategy and growth. The Bank manages the risk through a framework of risk management encompassing policies and procedures, organisational structures, risk measurement and monitoring processes and techniques that are closely aligned with business activities of the Bank.

# Risk management principles

- The Board of Directors (the Board) provides overall risk management supervision. The Board Risk Management Committee regularly reviews the Bank’s risk profile.
- The Bank has set up objectives and policies to manage the risks that arise in connection with the Bank’s activities. The risk management framework and policies of the Bank are guided by specific objectives to ensure that comprehensive and adequate risk management tools and techniques are established to mitigate the salient risk elements in the operations of the Bank.
- The establishment of the overall financial risk management objectives is consistent and in tandem with the strategy to create and enhance shareholders’ value, whilst guided by a prudent risk management framework.
- The structure of risk management function is closely aligned with the organisational structure of the Bank.
- The risk management function is independent of the Bank’s operations.

# Risk management organisation

The Board Risk Management Committee comprises of four non-executive directors. One of the non-executive directors of the Bank chairs the Risk Management Committee.

Specialized Committees comprising of Senior Management team members perform their functions in line with the strategic direction set by the Board while ensuring that there is optimal balance between risk reward trade-off. The Committees include:

|Name of the sub-committee|Chaired by|
|---|---|
|Credit Risk Management Committee (CRMC)|President & CEO|
|Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO)|President & CEO|
|Compliance and Operational Risk Management Committee (CORMC)|President & CEO|

CRMC is responsible to oversee credit risk activities on Bank wide basis while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies. Its responsibilities also include to provide support and guide front lines in managing their businesses, perform finance portfolio review, establish financing standards and benchmarks, maintain adequate industry diversification and decide upon provisioning. It is also required to delegate financing approving powers & prudential limits on large financing exposures. Credit Committee, a sub-committee of CRMC is the highest level body for approval of financing transactions.

ALCO is responsible for reviewing the Asset and Liability structure of the Bank, monitoring the liquidity situation and overall changing market scenario. Market and Liquidity risks are examined based on stress testing exercises and gap analysis. ALCO is also responsible for monitoring policy rate movements and taking necessary steps across various products to ensure that the overall profitability of the Bank is maximized without compromising on risk appetite. ALCO also ensures that the Banks’ overall operations are fully compliant with regulatory framework for the business as provided by the State Bank of Pakistan.

The CORMC is responsible for overseeing compliance risk by reviewing the adequacy of controls in place to meet regulatory requirements. The Committee is responsible for promoting compliance culture in the Bank, facilitate in implementation of Compliance Program and oversee Money Laundering, and Financing Terrorism and Proliferation risk. In addition, the Committee also oversees Operational Risk Framework by ensuring that policies and procedures are in place in all Key risk areas and by reviewing Key Risk Indicators. The Committee also monitors level of compliance of major unresolved and recurring issues pointed out in the Internal Audit, Shariah Audit and SBP Inspection Report.

The Bank’s risk management, compliance, internal audit and legal departments support the risk management function. The role of the risk management department is to assess, measure, identify risks and established risk mitigants through a detailed policy and monitoring framework. The compliance department ensures that all the directives and guidelines issued by the SBP are being complied with in order to mitigate the compliance risk. The internal audit and BRR department reviews the compliance of internal control procedures with internal and regulatory standards.

# 50.1 Credit risk

Credit risk arises from the potential that an obligor is either unwilling to perform on an obligation or its ability to perform such obligations is impaired resulting in economic loss to the Bank. This credit risk arises mainly from both direct financing activities as well as contingent liabilities.

# Credit risk management and structure

The Bank manages credit risk by effective credit appraisal mechanism, approving and reviewing authorities, limit structures, internal credit risk rating system, collateral management and post disbursement monitoring so as to ensure prudent financing activities and sound financing portfolio under the umbrella of a comprehensive Financing Policy approved by the Board of Directors. A comprehensive financing procedural manual approved by the senior management is also in place. The Bank also ensures diversification of its portfolio into different business segments, products and sectors. Further, to avoid risk concentration; counterparty limits, counterparty group limits and industry concentration limits are also established, monitored and assessed in the light of changing counterparty and market conditions. Watchlist procedure is also functioning which identifies financings with early warning indicators in respect of clients which may become non performing. The risk management function also monitors the non-performing financing portfolio of the Bank and reports all significant matters to the Board Risk Management Committee. The Bank takes into account the risk mitigating effect of the eligible collaterals for the calculation of capital requirement for credit risk.

# 50.1.1 Methodologies and models used for the measurement of Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD)

# 50.1.1.1 IFRS 9 outlines a 'three-stage' model for impairment based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition as summarised below:

Stage 1: When financial instruments are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and they have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure at default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected Loss given default (LGD) and discounted by an approximation to the original effective profit rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

Stage 2: When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but probability of default (PD) are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

Stage 3: For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises the lifetime expected credit losses for these instruments. The Bank uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio. This is then compared with allowance computed under SBP Prudential Regulations and higher of the two amounts is taken as the allowance for credit-impaired instrument.

Purchased or originated credit impaired (POCI): POCI assets are financial assets that are credit impaired on initial recognition. POCI assets are recorded at fair value at original recognition and profit / rental is subsequently recognised based on approximation to a credit-adjusted effective profit rate. ECLs are only recognised or released to the extent that there is a subsequent change in the expected credit losses.

Undrawn financing commitments: When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected shortfalls in cash flows if the financings is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

# 50.1.1.1 Guarantee and letters of credit

The Bank estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs is recognised within other liabilities.

# 50.1.1.2 Forward looking information

In the ECL models, the Bank relies on a range of forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

- GDP growth
- Volume of exports of goods
- Consumer price index
- Unemployment rate

# 50.1.1.3 The calculation of ECLs

The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI, undrawn financing commitments, guarantee and letter of credits is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour (e.g. the likelihood of customers defaulting and the resulting losses).

The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is measured on either a 12-month (12M) or Lifetime basis depending on whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred since initial recognition or whether an asset is considered to be credit-impaired. Expected credit losses are the discounted product of the Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD), discounted at an approximation to the EIR, defined as follows:

A number of significant judgments are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such as:

- Determining criteria for significant increase in credit risk (note 50.1.1.6.1);
- Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL;
- Establishing the number and relative weightings of forward-looking scenarios for each type of portfolio and the associated ECL;
- Establishing groups of similar financial assets for the purposes of measuring ECL.

The Bank calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios (Base, best and worst) [after deriving PDs based on forward looking information as detailed below] to measure the expected cash shortfalls, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive.

# 50.1.1.4 The mechanics of the ECL calculations

The key elements are, as follows:

# PD

The Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). PDs for non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.

# EAD

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued profit from missed payments. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has the legal right to call it earlier. The Bank’s product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail facilities, in which the Bank has the right to cancel and / or reduce the facilities with one day notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Bank does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the Bank’s expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the Bank’s future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

# Notes to and Forming Part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

# LGD

The Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD. Bank has estimated segment wise LGDs for Corporate/Commercial, SME & Agri Portfolio as well as product wise LGDs for House Finance, Car Ijarah, Bike Ijarah and Consumer ease. The LGDs are determined using workout approach, based on vintage recovery data for the defaulted portfolio; these recoveries are then discounted back to date of default, to factor in time value of money. The Bank has converted the estimates for segment / product wise historical LGDs (Through the cycle LGDs) into forward looking point in time LGDs, through use of term structure of Point in time PDs.

# 50.1.1.5 ECL Principles, Grouping and Calculations

The ECL is determined by projecting the PD, LGD and EAD for each future repayment date and for each individual exposure. These three components are multiplied together, effectively calculating an ECL for each future repayment date, which is then discounted back to the reporting date and summed. The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective profit rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective profit rate (at reporting date), the Bank uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date).

Effective profit rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three scenarios (base case, best case, worst case). Each of these is associated with different PDs. When relevant, the assessment of multiple scenarios also incorporates how defaulted financing are expected to be recovered, including the probability that the financing will cure and the value of collateral or the amount that might be received for selling the asset.

The Bank considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics:

- History of legal certainty and enforceability
- History of enforceability and recovery.

The Bank's management has only considered cash, liquid securities, gold, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals in the LGD calculation. All of these collaterals have a 0% haircut other than equity securities where haircut of 15% is applied.

The credit exposure (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

The SBP has issued FAQs in its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 with regard to certain interpretation of the SBP application instructions. In respect of Stage 3 provision, the SBP has clarified that the banks, while assessing the higher of IFRS 9 ECL and provision under the SBP Prudential Regulations, shall take into account the ECL against corporate / commercial / SME islamic financing and related assets portfolios at the borrower / facility level, and for the retail borrowers at segment / product basis.

# 50.1.1.6 ECL Modeling and staging criteria / Significant increase in ECLs / Cooling off criteria and movement between stages

# 50.1.1.6.1 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure (including profit accrued) to have significantly increased in credit risk when:

# Notes to and Forming Part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

# Quantitative criteria

The Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than specified days.

# Qualitative criteria

- whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition based on internal ratings.
- The customer / facility has been placed on the watchlist rating.

For all the balances with other banks (local / foreign), due from FIs and sovereign exposures (in foreign currency), external ratings falling below specified rating grade shall be considered as SICR and the exposure will be classified in stage 2.

Exposure below specified rating grade, at origination, will be considered in stage 2.

# Cooling off criteria

A customer classified as stage 2 will move to stage 1 if the following criteria is met and it does not meet SICR indicators at the reporting date.

|Reason for classification in Stage 2 (refer to SICR)|Move to Stage 1 when|
|---|---|
|Delinquency|Counterparty should not be delinquent as at reporting date. **|
|Restructured / rescheduling|Customer is regular as per Prudential Regulations for customers classified as Non-performing financing. *|
|Risk rating|As per the revised rating, the customer does not fall in the criteria of downgrading to Stage 2. *|

*A minimum cooling period is required, from meeting the relevant criteria, before any financial asset is moved back to Stage 1.

**A minimum cooling period or next payment made on due date, whichever is later, from meeting the relevant criteria has lapsed/ occurred before customer is moved back to Stage 1.

As a general rule, the underlying facility must have become regular, should be current and no longer meets the definition of credit impaired or is in default before it can be reclassified back from Stage 3.

Any upgrading of non-performing exposure to a performing status must be subject to a cooling off period of specified months. However, for financings classified as non-performing, cooling off period and other conditions specified in PRs will have to be complied with. If the facility has been regular doing cooling off period, it will move back to stage 2 after which the criteria for moving from stage 1 to stage 2 will be applied.

# 50.1.3 Credit Risk - General Disclosures

The Bank has adopted Standardised Approach of Basel Accord for calculation of capital charge against credit risk. Therefore, risk weights for the credit risk related assets (on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet - market and non market related exposures) are assigned on basis of standardised approach. The Bank is committed to further strengthen its risk management framework which will enable the Bank to move ahead for adopting Foundation Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach of Basel II. Meanwhile, none of the Bank's assets class is subject to the Foundation IRB or advanced IRB approaches.

# 50.1.3.1 Credit Risk: Disclosure for portfolio subject to the Standardised Approach

Under standardised approach the capital requirement is based on the credit rating assigned to the counterparties by the External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) duly recognised by the SBP for capital adequacy purposes. In this connection, the Bank utilises the credit ratings assigned by ECAIs and has recognised agencies such as PACRA (Pakistan Credit Rating Agency) and VIS Credit Rating Company which are also recognised by the SBP. In case of foreign currency exposures against banks, ratings assigned by S&P, Fitch and Moody’s have been applied.

# Use of ECAI Ratings

The Bank prefers solicited ratings over unsolicited ratings at all times, owing to the greater degree of accuracy (in general) associated with solicited ratings. Unsolicited ratings may only be used in cases where a solicited rating is not available.

# Mapping to SBP Rating Grades

The alignment of the Alphanumerical scale of each agency is mapped with risk buckets in accordance with instructions laid down by SBP under Basel II requirements.

# 50.1.3.3 Credit Risk: Disclosures with respect to Credit risk mitigation for Standardised approach

The Bank obtains capital relief for both its on-balance and off-balance sheet non-market related exposures by using simple approach for credit risk mitigation (CRM). Off-balance sheet items under the simplified standardised approach are converted into credit exposure equivalents through the use of credit conversion factors. Under the standardised approach the Bank has taken advantage of the cash collaterals available with the Bank in the form of security deposits, cash margins, certificates of Islamic investment, monthly mudaraba certificate, saving accounts, guarantees and Government securities.

The credit equivalent amount of an off-balance sheet market related foreign exchange contracts are determined by using the current exposure (mark to market) method.

The total benefit of Rs 490,707.642 million was availed through CRM against total on-balance sheet exposure of Rs 3,898,173.885 million. Under off-balance sheet, total benefit of Rs 20,875.550 million was availed by the Bank through CRM against total off-balance sheet, non-market related exposure of Rs 1,609,796.379 million. In the year 2024, total CRM benefit was Rs 511,583.192 million as against amount of Rs 323,097.529 million in year 2023.

# 50.1.3.4 Credit concentration risk

Credit concentration risk arises mainly due to concentration of exposures under various categories viz., industry, geography, and single / group borrower obligor. Within credit portfolio, as a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of risks, the SBP has prescribed regulatory limits on banks’ maximum exposure to single and group obligors. Within the SBP limits, the Bank has further defined limits to avoid excessive concentration of portfolio.

# 50.2 Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market prices. Market risk reflects yield rate risk, currency risk and other price risks. Banks could be adversely affected by movements in market rates or prices such as benchmark rates, deposit rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and market conditions resulting in a loss to earnings and capital.

# 50.2.1 Equity position in the banking and trading book

# Notes to and Forming Part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

The Bank uses a number of methods to monitor and control market risk exposures. One of the major tools used by the
Bank to monitor and limit market risk is Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is defined as the estimated loss that will arise on a position
or a portfolio over a particular (holding) period of time from an adverse market movement with a specific probability
(confidence level). The VaR model used by the Bank takes 99% confidence level and assumes a 1 to 10 days holding period
whilst using the historical simulation taking the data of the last three years. Daily VaR figures are circulated to the senior
management and regular summaries are reported in ALCO meetings.

The VaR reports are complemented by various other position and sensitivity limit structures, including stress, sensitivity,
gap and scenario analysis. The capital charge for market risk has been calculated by using Standardized Approach.

# 50.2.3 Foreign exchange risk

The foreign exchange risk is defined as the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse
movements in currency exchange rates. It refers to the impact of adverse movement in currency exchange rates on the
value of open foreign currency position. The objectives of the foreign exchange risk management is to minimise the adverse
impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the assets and liabilities mismatch (tenor and position) and maximise their
earnings.

Whenever a commercial bank deals in foreign currency, it is exposed to risk of exchange rate. The Bank's assets and
liabilities in foreign currencies give rise to foreign exchange risk which has to be managed by the Bank; this risk is mitigated
by using different hedging techniques. Hedging is a way used by a bank to eliminate or minimize its risk exposures. Hedging
can be done using different ways like gap analysis, hedging (forwards), assigning limits in terms of amount, tenor, currency,
product, countries, counterparties etc. The Bank limits its currency exposure to the extent of statutory net open position
prescribed by the SBP except in the cases where exemption is provided by the SBP. Foreign exchange open and mismatch
positions are controlled through close monitoring and are marked to market on a daily basis.

The analysis below represents the concentration of the Bank's foreign currency risk for on and off balance sheet financial
instruments:

# 50.2.5 Yield / profit rate risk

Yield risk occurs when there is a mismatch between positions, which are subject to profit rate alterations within a particular time period. The Bank’s financing, placement and investment activities give rise to profit rate risk. The effect of changes in profit rate is on the Bank’s income, and resultant impact is on the Bank’s net worth.

Profit rate risk is primarily managed by monitoring the rate sensitive gaps and by having the pre-approved limits for repricing buckets. ALCO is the supervising body for adherence with these, complemented by the monitoring of sensitivity of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities to various scenarios.

The Bank estimates changes in the market value of equity due to changes in the yield rates on on-balance sheet positions and their impact on capital adequacy ratio by conducting stress tests. It also assesses risk on earnings of the Bank by various shocks.

The Bank takes on exposure to the effects of fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market profit rates on both its fair value and cash flow risks. Profit margins may increase as a result of such changes but may reduce to losses in the event that unexpected movement arise.

# 50.3 Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss to the Bank arising from either its inability to meet its obligations or to fund increases in assets as they fall due without incurring an unacceptable cost. The Bank’s Board of Directors sets the Bank’s policy for managing liquidity risk and entrusts accountability for supervision of the implementation of this strategy to senior management. Senior management exercises its responsibilities for managing market & liquidity risk through various committees including the Asset & Liability Management Committee (ALCO). Treasury department manages the Bank’s liquidity position on a daily basis. The Bank’s main approach of managing the liquidity risk is to make certain that it will always have adequate liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due in normal and stressed scenarios without incurring any untoward expenditure or risking reputational harm. ALCO monitors the maintenance of liquidity ratios, depositor's concentration both in terms of the overall funding mix and avoidance of undue reliance on large individual deposits. Regular liquidity stress testing is conducted under a variety of scenarios covering both normal and more severe market conditions.

# 50.4 Operational risk

The Bank uses Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) for assessing the capital charge for operational risk. Under BIA the capital charge is calculated by multiplying average positive annual gross income of the Bank over past three years with 15% as per guidelines issued by SBP under Basel II. To reduce losses arising from operational risk, the Bank has strengthened its risk management framework by developing polices, strategies, guidelines and manuals. It also includes set up of functions like operational risk management, prevention of fraud and forgery and information security function, defining responsibilities of individuals, implementing four eye principle, enhancing security measures, improving efficiency and effectiveness of operations, outsourcing and improving quality of human resources through trainings and development.

# 6.1 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

As directed by the SBP via BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 17, 2023, IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' is effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 (previously January 01, 2023) for banks having asset base of more than Rs. 500 billion as at December 31, 2022. Moreover, SBP has also issued application instructions on IFRS 9 for banks in Pakistan for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard in the banks.

IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of accounting for financial liabilities. To determine appropriate classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments, to be assessed based on combination of the entity's business model for managing the assets and the instruments' contractual cash flow characteristics. The adoption of IFRS 9 has also fundamentally changed the impairment method of financial assets with a forward-looking Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach.

The SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No.16 dated July 29, 2024 and BPRD Circular Letter No.01 dated January 25, 2025 (Letters) has made certain amendments and clarified the timelines of some of the SBP's IFRS 9 Application Instructions to address the matters raised by the banks to ensure compliance by the timelines. The Letters have provided clarifications / relaxations on measurement of unquoted equity securities, modification accounting, maintenance of general provisions over and above expected credit loss allowance (ECL), accounting methodology for Islamic Banking Institutions and treatment of charity. Accordingly, the Holding Company has adopted the treatment as instructed in the aforementioned Letters in these consolidated financial statements. In addition, the SBP in a separate instructions BPRD/RPD/822456/25 dated January 22, 2025 has allowed extension for application of Effective Profit Rate up to December 31, 2025.

On application of IFRS 9, certain accounting policies have been revised to comply with the requirements of IFRS 9. The revised accounting policies have been disclosed in their respective policy notes in these consolidated financial statements.

The SBP has directed the Banks through its BPRD Circular Letter No.1 dated January 22, 2025 to disclose the impact of IFRS 9 on revenue recognition from Islamic Operations which is as follows:

Had IFRS 9 been adopted in its entirety for revenue recognition from Islamic operations profit / return earned on Islamic financing and related assets in consolidated statement of profit and loss account for the year ended December 31, 2024 would have been higher by Rs. 907.35 million and taxation would have been higher by Rs 489.97 million. Further, an unappropriated profit in consolidated statement of changes in equity would have been higher by Rs 5,186 million.

# 6.1.1 Application to the Group's financial assets

Debt based financial assets held by the Holding Company include: Islamic financing and related assets, investments in federal government securities and other government / private sukuks, due from financial institutions, cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks, and other financial assets.

a) Financial assets are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as at FVTPL:

- the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and profit on the principal amount outstanding.

The Group's business model for these financial assets can still be hold to collect (HTC) even when sales of these financial assets occur. However, if more than an infrequent number of sale of significant value are made, the Group assesses whether and how the sales are consistent with the HTC objective. This assessment includes the reasons for the sales, the expected frequency of sales, and whether the assets that are sold are held for an extended period of time relative to their contractual maturities.

b) Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) only if it meets both of the following conditions and are not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
---
# Notes to and Forming Part of the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and profit on the principal amount outstanding.

c) Financial assets, if held for trading purposes are measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

The application of these policies also resulted in classifications and consequent remeasurements of certain investments in GoP Ijarah sukuks held under available for sale portfolio as at December 31, 2023 based on business model. Moreover, the Group's investment in sub-ordinated sukuks issued by other banks under available for sale portfolio as of December 31, 2023 have been reclassified to FVTPL since they do not pass the solely payments of principal and profit (SPPI) criteria due to equity conversion features embedded in the terms of these sukuks. Additionally, the Group has elected to classify its investments in Islamic Naya Pakistan Certificates (previously classified under Available for Sale portfolio) as at December 31, 2023 at FVTPL.

Equity based financial assets

Equity instruments are instruments that meet the definition of equity from the issuer's perspective; that is, instruments that do not contain a contractual obligation to pay and that evidence a residual share in the issuer's net assets.

The Group measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), except where the Group's management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Group's policy is to designate the equity investments as FVOCI when those investments are held for purposes other than for trading.

When this election is used, fair value gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income and are not subsequently reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit and loss account, including on disposal. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return on such investments, continue to be recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account as income when the Group's right to receive payments is established.

Unquoted equity instruments can be measured at lower of cost or breakup value till December 31, 2024 as per the BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024. However, the Group has early adopted fair valuation policy for its investment in unquoted equity instruments whose fair value can reliably be determined and accordingly, the Group has reversed the provision in respect of unquoted equity instruments amounting to Rs 64.77 million.

IFRS 9 has eliminated impairment assessment requirements for investments in equity instruments. Accordingly, the Group has reversed impairment of Rs 2,562 million on equity investment held as at December 31, 2023 and the same has been transferred to deficit on revaluation of investments through remeasurements.

Gains and losses on equity instruments at FVTPL are recognised in the ‘Gain / (loss) on securities’ in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account.

The measurement category and carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan before and after adoption of IFRS 9 as at January 1, 2024 are compared as follows:

# 6.1.2 Adoption of new forms for the preparation of financial statements

The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 02 dated February 09, 2023 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 dated April 13, 2023, issued the revised formats of the annual / interim financial statements which are applicable for the preparation of annual financial statements, periods beginning on or after January 01, 2024 (previously January 01, 2023). The implementation of the revised formats has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the financial statements. The significant change is that the right of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities against right-of-use assets are now presented separately on the face of statement of financial position. Previously, these were presented under property and equipment (previously titled fixed assets) and other liabilities respectively. As a result of this change, the property and equipment of the Group decreased by Rs. 21,623 million and Rs. 19,867 million as December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively. Furthermore, other liabilities of the Group decreased by Rs. 26,286 million and Rs. 22,412 as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively. There is no impact of this change on the consolidated financial statements in terms of recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities.

The Group has adopted the above changes in the presentation and made additional disclosures to the extent applicable to its operations and corresponding figures have been rearranged / reclassified to correspond to current year presentation, as presented in note 53.

# Notes to and Forming Part of the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

# 6.2 Financial assets and liabilities

# 6.2.1 Classification

Financial assets

Under IFRS 9, existing categories of financial assets: Held for Trading (HFT), Available for Sale (AFS) and Held to Maturity (HTM) and loans and receivables have been replaced by:

- Financial assets at amortised cost
- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss account (FVTPL)

Financial liabilities

Under IFRS 9, the accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus all financial liabilities are being carried at amortised cost. Financial liabilities can also be designated at FVTPL where gains or losses arising from entity's own credit rating risk are required to be presented in other comprehensive income with no reclassification to profit and loss account.

# 6.2.2 Business model assessment

The Group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Group's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity's key management personnel;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Group’s assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Group's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Group's original expectations, the Group does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.

Securities held for trading are held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term or are part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. These securities are classified in the 'other' business model and measured at FVTPL.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:

1. Hold to Collect (HTC) Business Model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash flows.
2. Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S) Business Model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
3. Other Business Models: Resulting in classification of financial assets as FVTPL.

# 6.2.3 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and profit (SPPI)

As a second step of its classification process, the Group assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. ‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium / discount). The most significant elements of profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of

Annual Report 2024

298
---
# Notes to and Forming Part of the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Group applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the profit rate is set. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with basic financing arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL.

# 6.2.3.1 Debt instruments previously classified as available for sale but which fail the SPPI test

The Group holds a portfolio of debt instruments that failed to meet the 'solely payments of principal and profit' (SPPI) requirement for amortised cost and FVOCI classification under IFRS 9. These instruments contain provisions that, in certain circumstances, allow the issuer to fully convert the instrument into common shares or the issuer can also exercise the call option with prior approval of the SBP. This clause breaches the criterion that profit payments should only be consideration for credit risk and the time value of money on the principal. As a result, these instruments, were classified as FVTPL from the date of initial application as mentioned in the note 6.1.3.

# 6.2.4 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Group purchase or sell the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like Islamic financing and related assets, due from financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account or financial institutions or as per underlying Shariah mode. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased. The Group will recognise due to customer and financial institution balances when these funds reach the Group.

# a) Amortised cost (AC)

Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and profit ('SPPl), and that are not designated at FVTPL, are measured at amortised cost. Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in consolidated statement of profit and loss account. Rental / profit income / dividend income / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, gain / (loss) is recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and profit, and that are not designated at FVTPL, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. They are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in consolidated statement of other comprehensive income. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for these financial assets in consolidated statement of profit and loss account. Rental / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / (loss) will be recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account only in case of debt instruments. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / (loss) is transferred from surplus / deficit on revaluations of assets to unappropriated profit.

# c) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. They are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost is directly recorded in consolidated statement of profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in consolidated statement of profit and loss account. Rental / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss is recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

# 6.2.5 Derecognition

Financial assets

Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and either (i) the Group transfers

Annual Report 2024

299
---
# Notes to and Forming Part of the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

Substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or (ii) the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and the Group has not retained control. The Group enters into transactions where it retains the contractual rights to receive cash flows from assets but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to other entities and transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards. These transactions are accounted for as 'pass through' transfers that result in derecognition of the Group:

1. Has no obligation to make payments unless it collects equivalent amounts from the assets;
2. Is prohibited from selling or pledging the assets; and
3. Has an obligation to remit any cash it collects from the assets without material delay.

Collateral (shares and sukuks) furnished by the Group under due from institutions are not derecognised because the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards on the basis of the predetermined repurchase price, and the criteria for derecognition are therefore not met.

# Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are derecognised when these are extinguished (i.e. when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires). The exchange between the Group and its original participants of debt instruments with substantially different terms, as well as substantial modifications of the terms of existing financial liabilities, are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The terms are substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net of any fees received and discounted using the original effective interest rate, is at least 10% different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. In addition, other qualitative factors, such as the currency that the instrument is denominated in, changes in the type of profit rate, new conversion features attached to the instrument and change in covenants are also taken into consideration.

If an exchange of debt instruments or modification of terms is accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the extinguishment. If the exchange or modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified liability. The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# Modification

The Holding Company sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of financing to its customers. When the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified and the renegotiation or modification does not result in the derecognition of that financial asset (that is terms are not substantially different) in accordance with IFRS 9, the Holding Company recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset and shall recognise a modification gain or loss in consolidated statement of profit and loss account. The gross carrying amount of the financial asset is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial asset’s original approximate effective profit rate (or approximate credit-adjusted effective profit rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets). Any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

If the terms are substantially different, the Holding Company derecognises the original financial asset and recognised a 'new' asset at fair value and recalculates a new approximate to effective profit rate for the asset. The date of renegotiation is consequently considered to be the date of initial recognition for credit loss allowance calculation purposes, including for the purpose of determining whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. Gain / loss on derecognition of such financial asset is recognised in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# 6.2.7 Financial guarantee contracts

Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Such financial guarantees are given to banks, financial institutions and others on behalf of customers to secure loans, overdrafts and other banking facilities.

Financial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of:

- The amount of the loss allowance;
- The premium received on initial recognition less income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.

# 6.3 Overview of the expected credit loss (ECL) principles

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss allowance ('ECL') associated with Islamic financing and related assets and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and irrevocable unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Group recognises a credit loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- The time value of money; and
- Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL) as outlined below.

The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

Effective profit rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

The Group has identified basis of ECL computation for following stages:

- Stage 1: No significant deterioration in credit quality of financial asset - 12 month expected credit loss.
- Stage 2: Significant deterioration in credit quality of financial asset since recognition - lifetime expected credit loss.
- Stage 3: Credit impaired - impairment determined on individual or collective basis over the lifetime.

The staging guidelines applicable on the Holding Company has been adopted from the application instructions of IFRS - 9 issued by the SBP vide its BPRD circular 3 of 2022.

|Particular|Classification|Days due|Stage allocation under IFRS 9|Provisions to be made|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Prudential regulation for corporate|Performing|1-59|Stage 1|As per IFRS 9 ECL modelling|
| |Under-performing|60-89|Stage 2| |

# Definition of default

The concept of “impairment” or “default” is critical to the implementation of IFRS 9 as it drives determination of risk parameters i.e PD and LGD.

SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022 dated July 5, 2022 has prescribed objective basis, based on Days Past Due, for classification of financing in stage 3. In addition to time based criteria, SBP requires Banks to evaluate and, where required, subjectively classify or further downgrade classification of financing. ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at Customer /Obligor/ facility level for corporate / commercial / SME / Agri Financing portfolios and at segment / product basis for retail portfolio as prescribed by SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024.

All other repairs and maintenance expenditure are charged to the consolidated statement of profit and loss account as and when incurred.

# 6.8.5 Depreciation / amortisation related to property and equipment and intangible assets

Depreciation / amortisation is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account by applying the straight line method in accordance with the rates specified in notes 12.2 and 14.1 whereby the depreciable value of an asset is written off over its estimated service life. The Group charges depreciation / amortisation from the month of acquisition and up to the month preceding the disposal. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term specified in note 13.

# 6.8.6 Useful lives and residual values related to property and equipment and intangible assets

Useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if impact on depreciation / amortisation is significant.

# 6.8.7 Impairment related to property and equipment and intangible assets

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that the operating fixed assets may be impaired. If such indication exists, the carrying amounts of such assets are reviewed to assess whether they are recorded in excess of their recoverable amounts. Where carrying values exceed the respective recoverable amounts, assets are written down to their recoverable amounts and the resulting impairment charge is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# 6.9 Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities

# Right-of-use assets

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The right-of-use assets are subject to impairment in line with the Holding Company’s policy as described in note 6.21.

# Lease liabilities

At the inception of the contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control that affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. The Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental fund acceptance rate to measure lease liabilities.

# Incremental fund acceptance rate

The Incremental fund acceptance rate is the rate of profit that the Group would have to pay to accept its fund over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.

# 6.10 Taxation

# Current

The charge for current taxation is based on expected taxable income for the year in accordance with the prevailing laws of taxation. The charge for current tax also includes adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years including those arising from assessments finalised during the year and are separately disclosed.

# Prior years

This charge includes tax charge for prior years arising from assessments, changes in estimates and change in law.

# Deferred

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the temporary differences relating to initial recognition of goodwill, initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profits and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realised.

In making the estimates for current and deferred taxes, the management considers the income tax law and the decisions of appellate authorities on certain issues in the past.

# 6.11 Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

The non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation. The useful lives are reviewed annually and adjusted, if appropriate. These assets are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. Surplus arising on revaluation of property, if any, is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of assets' account in the statement of other comprehensive income. Any deficit arising on revaluation is taken to consolidated statement of profit and loss account directly. On derecognition of the assets, the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to unappropriated profit in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Legal fees, transfer cost and direct cost of acquiring title to property is charged to the consolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# 6.12 Deposits

Deposits are generated on the basis of two modes i.e. Qard and Mudaraba.

Deposits taken on Qard basis are classified as 'Current accounts' and Deposits generated on Mudaraba basis are classified as 'Savings deposits' and 'Fixed deposits'. No profit or loss is passed on to current account depositors, however the funds of current accounts are treated as equity for the purpose of profit calculation and any profit earned / loss incurred on those funds are allocated to the equity of the Group. While the product features of each product differ, there is usually no restriction on withdrawals or number of transactions in current and savings accounts. In case of fixed deposits, pre-mature withdrawals can be made as per approved terms only.

Profits realised in investment pools are distributed in pre-agreed profit sharing ratio between Rab-ul-Maal and Mudarib. Rab-ul-Maal share is distributed among depositors according to weightages assigned at the inception of the profit calculation period. Mudarib can distribute its share of profit to Rab-ul-Maal as Incentive profits (Hiba). Profits are distributed from the pool such that the depositors (remunerative) only bear the risk of assets in the pool during the profit calculation period. In case of loss in a pool during the profit calculation period, the loss is distributed among the depositors (remunerative) according to their ratio of Investments.

Asset pools are created at the Group’s discretion and the Group can add, amend or transfer an asset to any other pool in the interests of the deposit holders.

Under the general deposits pools, the Group accepts funds on Mudaraba basis from depositors (Rab-ul-Maal) where the Group acts as Manager (Mudarib) and invests the funds in the Shariah Compliant modes of financing, investments and placements. When utilising investing funds, the Group prioritizes the funds received from depositors over the funds generated from own sources after meeting the regulatory requirement relating to such deposits.

Specific pools are operated for funds acquired / accepted from the State Bank of Pakistan and other banks for Islamic Export Refinance to the Group's customers and liquidity management respectively under the Musharakah / Mudaraba modes.

The profit of each deposit pool is calculated on all the remunerative assets booked by utilising the funds from the pool after deduction of expenses directly incurred in earning the income of such pool along with related fee income, if any. The directly related costs comprise of depreciation on ijarah assets, takaful premium, documentation charges etc. No expense of general or administrative nature is charged to the pools. No provision against any non-performing asset of the pool is passed on to the pool except on the actual loss / write-off of such non-performing asset. The profit of the pool is shared between equity and other members of the pool on the basis of Musharakah at gross level (before charging of mudarib fee) as per the investment ratio of the equity. The profit of the pool is shared among the members of the pool on pre-defined mechanism based on the weightages announced before the profit calculation period after charging of mudarib fee. During the year, the Group has given General Hiba to the depositors of General Pools, keeping in view the prescribed guidelines of Pool Management provided by the SBP and with the approval of the Group's Resident Shariah Board Member. However, Hiba are given at the sole discretion of the Group without any contractual commitment and can be withdrawn or reduced by the Group at its sole discretion.

The risk characteristic of each pool mainly depends on the assets and liabilities profile of each pool. As per the Group's policy, relatively low risk / secured financing transactions and assets are allocated to general depositors pool of Rupee, USD, GBP and Euro. The Group maintains General Pools (Rupee, USD, EUR, GBP), FI Pools, IERS pool and Equity pool.

All remunerative deposits are tagged to these general pools and their funds generated from the depositors are invested on priority basis.

Investments from the SBP under various long term Islamic refinance schemes, and sub-ordinated sukuks are also remunerated through the Rupee General Pool. Due to limited investment options in USD, GBP and EURO pool, funds from foreign currency pools are invested in available International Sukuk, Shariah Compliant Nostro accounts, foreign currency financing and the remaining funds are taken out and invested in Rupee general pool as part of equity. In such cases return from Rupee General Pool is given back to foreign currency pools, so that returns can be passed on to foreign currency pool customers accordingly. The Holding Company as Mudarib in the general pools is responsible for financing costs / assets such as land, building, furniture, fixtures, computers and IT system from its own sources / equity.

# IERS Pools:

The IERS pool assets comprise of sovereign guaranteed sukuk, and financing to / sukuk of mainly blue chip companies and exporters as allowed under the applicable rules and regulations, and as such are exposed to lower credit risk. The Musharakah with SBP under IERS is tagged to the IERS pool.

The Subsidiary Company (AMIML) believes that SWWF is not applicable on the Company as it is not a Financial Institution as defined under SWWF and in respect of WWF, the Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated November 10, 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of workers welfare fund were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending. Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions the judgment may not be treated as conclusive. Accordingly, the Group continues to maintain the provision in respect of WWF and SWWF.

# Notes to and Forming Part of the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the gratuity liability recognised within the consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

# 41.11

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 9.60 years.

# 41.12

Expected maturity analysis of undiscounted defined benefit obligation for the Gratuity Funded Scheme is as follows:

|Less than a year|Between 1-2 years|Between 2-5 years| |Over 5 years|Total|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | |Rupees in ‘000| | |
|At December 31, 2024|490,434|424,281|1,651,132|32,866,341|35,432,188|
|At December 31, 2023|272,589|266,748|911,658|48,466,805|49,917,800|

# 41.13

Funding levels are monitored on an annual basis and are based on actuarial recommendations. Contribution for the next year works out to Rs 1,692.584 million as per the actuarial valuation report of the Bank as of December 31, 2024.

# 41.14

Through its Gratuity Funded Scheme, the Fund is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:

- Asset volatility: The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate sukuk yields; if plan assets underperform to the yield, this will create a deficit. The Fund believes that due to long-term nature of the plan liabilities and the Holding Company's support, the current investment strategy manages this risk adequately.
- Changes in sukuk yields: A decrease in corporate sukuk yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans' sukuk holdings.
- Inflation risk: The majority of the plans' benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. However, plan assets are variable rate instruments and are re-priced at regular intervals to offset inflationary impacts.
- Life expectancy / Withdrawal rate: The majority of the plans' obligations are to provide benefits on severance with the Holding Company on achieving retirement. Any change in life expectancy / withdrawal rate would impact plan liabilities.

# 41.15

Gratuity Funded Scheme - Subsidiary Company (AMIML)

The Subsidiary Company operates a defined benefit plan i.e. an approved funded gratuity scheme for all its permanent employees who have completed the minimum qualifying period of service as defined under the scheme. Actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every year.

The principal actuarial assumptions comprise of discount rate of 12.25 percent and salary increase rate of 11.75 percent. The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation due to a one percent change in discount rate would be Rs 6.55 million (in case the discount rate is increased) and Rs 6.66 million (in case the discount rate is decreased). These sensitivities are calculated using the same methodology as explained in note 41.10.

# 45 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as amortised cost / held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted debt securities classified as amortised cost / held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of valuation methodologies. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term financings, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and due to financial institutions cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer financings and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 45.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured as at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised.

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Listed Securities|The valuation has been determined through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange.|
|GoP Ijarah Sukuks|The fair value of GoP Ijarah sukuks listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange has been determined through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange. The fair value of other GoP Ijarah sukuks are derived using PKISRV rates. The PKISRV rates are announced by FMA (Financial Market Association) through Reuters. The rates announced are simple average of quotes received from eight different pre-defined / approved dealers / brokers.|
|Foreign Sukuks|These are measured at fair value using the rates published by the valuation expert (Bloomberg).|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mid rates announced by SBP.|
|Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in these Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2024.|
|Units of mutual funds|The valuation has been determined based on net asset values (NAV) declared by respective funds. The value of unquoted equity securities are determined by using different methods for different securities.|
|Unquoted Equity Securities|Fair value of investment in Sapphire Electric Company Limited has been determined by Dividend Discount Model (DDM) by using constant dividends streams of the entity by using various key assumptions considering economic and market conditions. Key assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate (if applicable).|
|Corporate sukuks|The valuation has been determined through closing rates announced by FMA (Financial Market Association) through Reuters.|

The Group's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the year.

The valuation of non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims, mentioned above, is conducted by the valuation expert appointed by the Holding Company which is also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation expert uses a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank's non-banking asset acquired in satisfaction of claims. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. This value is adjusted to reflect the current condition of the property. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuation cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these consolidated financial statements.

The reconciliation from the opening balance to the closing balance of the non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims has been disclosed in note 15.2.1. The change in the market value has been accounted for in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account.

The sensitivity analysis of the fair value measurement of unquoted equity securities due to changes in observable inputs has not been disclosed as the amount is not material and significant.

# 49 CAPITAL ASSESSMENT AND ADEQUACY BASEL SPECIFIC

# Capital structure

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) introduced updated guidelines with respect to disclosure of capital adequacy related information in the financial statements of banks vide its communication dated November 5, 2014. These guidelines are based on the requirements of Basel III which were introduced earlier by the SBP in August 2013 for implementation by banks in Pakistan. The SBP had specified a transitional period for implementing new standards which came to its end on December 31, 2019. The disclosures below have been prepared on the basis of these new guidelines. The comparative information is as per requirements which were applicable last year.

# 49.1 Capital structure

Under Basel III framework, the Bank's regulatory capital has been analysed into two tiers as follows:

- Tier 1 capital (going concern capital) which is sub divided into:
- a) Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), which includes fully paid up capital, balance in share premium account, statutory and general reserves, and un-appropriated profits (net of losses), after regulatory deductions for book value of intangibles, reciprocal cross holdings, investment in own shares.
- b) Additional Tier 1 capital (AT1), which includes perpetual, unsecured, subordinated, non-cumulative and contingent convertible Sukuk instrument issued by the Holding Company.
- Tier II capital, which includes sub-ordinated sukuks, general provisions for financing losses (up to a maximum of 1.25% of credit risk weighted assets) and surplus on revaluation of assets - net of tax.

Group operations are categorised in either the trading book or the banking book and risk weighted assets are determined according to the specified requirements that seek to reflect the varying levels of risk attached to assets and off balance sheet exposures. The required capital adequacy ratio is achieved by the Group through:

- (a) Adequate level of paid up capital;
- (b) Adequate risk profile of asset mix;
- (c) Ensuring better recovery management; and
- (d) Maintaining acceptable profit margins.

# 49.2 Capital adequacy ratio

The main objective of the capital management is to improve the financial position and strengthen the statement of
financial position of the Group to support the growth in business, provide protection to depositors and enhance
shareholders' value.

The Holding Company's Board and the management is committed to maintaining a sound balance between
depositors' liability and shareholders' funds so that optimal capital / debt ratio is maintained. The optimal capital /
debt ratio will provide reasonable assurance to depositor's about safety and security of their funds and at the same
time provide impetus to the management to invest their depositors’ funds into profitable ventures without
compromising the risk profile of the Holding company. The capital requirement of the Group has been determined
based on the projected growth plan to be achieved in the next 3 years in all areas of business operations.

The Holding Company prepares Annual Budget and Three Year Plan for purpose of the growth map and future
direction. Bottom up approach is used to prepare annual budget and detailed deliberations are held while preparing
Three Year Plan. The growth prospects takes into consideration prevailing economic and political factors in
Pakistan.

In implementing current capital requirements the State Bank of Pakistan requires banks to maintain minimum Capital
Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 11.50% as of December 31, 2024 whereas CAR stood at 20.57% as of December 31, 2024.

The Group calculates capital adequacy ratio for credit risk, market risk and operational risk based upon
requirements under Basel Accord as per guidelines issued by the State Bank of Pakistan from time to time in this
regard.

Sensitivity and stress testing of the Group under different risk factors namely yield rate, forced sale value of
collateral, non-performing financings and foreign exchange rate depicts that the Group’s capital adequacy ratio is
above the regulatory requirements.

# 51 RISK MANAGEMENT

Economic fundamentals improved and political uncertainty showed a decline during 2024. Stability in FX reserves, exchange rate and decline in policy rate were the major contributor to the overall improvement in economic situation. During the year, SBP decreased the benchmark interest rate by a cumulative 900 bps to 13%. This steep decrease was due to decline in headline inflation to 4.1% only in Dec 2024 resulting in ample cushion for SBP to focus on monetary easing. Stock market showed robust growth as benchmark index grow by 84% in 2024. However, fiscal policy remains a key challenge for the government to generate additional revenue. Sustainable fiscal measures along with external support from IMF and other sources will be the key determinant for the economy in the future.

The Holding Company is regularly conducting assessments of the credit portfolio, with robust post disbursement credit review mechanism to identify borrowers most likely to be affected in the challenging business and economic environment. The Holding Company is confident that it has more than sufficient risk bearing capacity to withstand these difficult times.

The wide variety of the Group’s business activities require the Group to identify, assess, measure, aggregate and manage risks effectively which are constantly evolving as the business activities expand in response to the Group's strategy and growth. The Group manages the risk through a framework of risk management encompassing policies and procedures, organisational structures, risk measurement and monitoring processes and techniques that are closely aligned with business activities of the Group.

# Risk management principles

- The Board of Directors (the Board) provides overall risk management supervision. The Board Risk Management Committee regularly reviews the Group's risk profile.
- The Group has set up objectives and policies to manage the risks that arise in connection with the Group’s activities. The risk management framework and policies of the Group are guided by specific objectives to ensure that comprehensive and adequate risk management tools and techniques are established to mitigate the salient risk elements in the operations of the Group.
---
# Notes to and Forming Part of the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

- The establishment of the overall financial risk management objectives is consistent and in tandem with the strategy to create and enhance shareholders’ value, whilst guided by a prudent risk management framework.

- The structure of risk management function is closely aligned with the organisational structure of the Group.

- The risk management function is independent of the Group’s operations.

# Risk management organisation

The Board Risk Management Committee comprises of four non-executive directors. One of the non-executive directors of the Holding company chairs the Risk Management Committee.

Specialized Committees comprising of Senior Management team members perform their functions in line with the strategic direction set by the Board while ensuring that there is optimal balance between risk reward trade-off. The Committees include:

|Name of the sub-committee|Chaired by|
|---|---|
|Credit Risk Management Committee (CRMC)|President & CEO of Holding Company|
|Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO)|President & CEO of Holding Company|
|Compliance and Operational Risk Management Committee (CORMC)|President & CEO of Holding Company|

CRMC is responsible to oversee credit risk activities on Group wide basis while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies. Its responsibilities also include to provide support and guide front lines in managing their businesses, perform finance portfolio review, establish financing standards and benchmarks, maintain adequate industry diversification and decide upon provisioning. It is also required to delegate financing approving powers & prudential limits on large financing exposures. Credit Committee, a sub-committee of CRMC is the highest level body for approval of financing transactions.

ALCO is responsible for reviewing the Asset and Liability structure of the Holding Company, monitoring the liquidity situation and overall changing market scenario. Market and Liquidity risks are examined based on stress testing exercises and gap analysis. ALCO is also responsible for monitoring policy rate movements and taking necessary steps across various products to ensure that the overall profitability of the Holding Company is maximized without compromising on risk appetite. ALCO also ensures that the Holding Company's overall operations are fully compliant with regulatory framework for the business as provided by the State Bank of Pakistan.

The CORMC is responsible for overseeing compliance risk by reviewing the adequacy of controls in place to meet regulatory requirements. The Committee is responsible for promoting compliance culture in the Holding Company, facilitate in implementation of Compliance Program and oversee Money Laundering and Financing Terrorism risk and Proliferation financing risk. In addition, the Committee also oversees Operational Risk Framework by ensuring that policies and procedures are in place in all Key risk areas and by reviewing Key Risk Indicators. The Committee also monitors level of compliance of major unresolved and recurring issues pointed out in the Internal Audit, Shariah Audit and SBP Inspection Report.

The Holding Company’s risk management, compliance, internal audit and legal departments support the risk management function. The role of the risk management department is to assess, measure, identify risks and establish risk mitigants through a detailed policy and monitoring framework. The compliance department ensures that all the directives and guidelines issued by the SBP are being complied with in order to mitigate the compliance risk. The internal audit and BRR department reviews the compliance of internal control procedures with internal and regulatory standards.

# 51.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk arises from the potential that an obligor is either unwilling to perform on an obligation or its ability to perform such obligations is impaired resulting in economic loss to the Group. This credit risk arises mainly from both direct financing activities as well as contingent liabilities.

# Credit risk management and structure

The Group manages credit risk by effective credit appraisal mechanism, approving and reviewing authorities, limit structures, internal credit risk rating system, collateral management and post disbursement monitoring so as to ensure prudent financing activities and sound financing portfolio under the umbrella of a comprehensive Financing Policy approved by the Board of Directors. A comprehensive financing procedural manual approved by the senior management is also in place. The Group also ensures diversification of its portfolio into different business segments, products and sectors. Further, to avoid risk concentration; counterparty limits, counterparty group limits and industry concentration limits are also established, monitored and assessed in the light of changing counterparty and market conditions.

Watchlist procedure is also functioning which identifies financings with early warning indicators in respect of clients which may become non performing. The risk management function also monitors the non-performing financing portfolio of the Holding Company and reports all significant matters to the Board Risk Management Committee.

The Holding Company takes into account the risk mitigating effect of the eligible collaterals for the calculation of capital requirement for credit risk.

Thus, use of CRM resulted in capital adequacy ratio of the Holding Company of 20.57%.

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

# 51.1.1 Methodologies and models used for the measurement of Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD)

# 51.1.1.1 IFRS 9 outlines a 'three-stage' model for impairment based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition as summarised below:

Stage 1: When financial instruments are first recognised, the Group recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and they have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Group calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure at default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected Loss given default (LGD) and discounted by an approximation to the original effective profit rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

Stage 2: When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, the Group records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but probability of default (PD) are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

Stage 3: For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Group recognises the lifetime expected credit losses for these instruments. The Group uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio. This is then compared with allowance computed under SBP Prudential Regulations and higher of the two amounts is taken as the allowance for credit-impaired instrument.

Purchased or originated credit impaired POCI: POCI assets are financial assets that are credit impaired on initial recognition. POCI assets are recorded at fair value at original recognition and profit / rental is subsequently recognised based on approximation to a credit-adjusted effective profit rate. ECLs are only recognised or released to the extent that there is a subsequent change in the expected credit losses.

Undrawn financing commitments: When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected shortfalls in cash flows if the financings is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. For revolving facilities that include both a financings and an undrawn commitment, ECLs are calculated on un-drawn portion of the facility and presented within other liabilities.

Guarantee and letters of credit: The Group estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs is recognised within other liabilities.

# 51.1.1.2 Forward looking information

In the ECL models, the Bank relies on a range of forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

- GDP growth
- Volume of exports of goods
- Consumer price index
- Unemployment rate

# 51.1.1.3 The calculation of ECLs

The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and
FVOCI, undrawn financing commitments, guarantee and letter of credits is an area that requires the use of
complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour (e.g. the
likelihood of customers defaulting and the resulting losses).

The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is measured on either a 12-month (12M) or Lifetime basis depending on
whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred since initial recognition or whether an asset is
considered to be credit-impaired. Expected credit losses are the discounted product of the Probability of
Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD), discounted at an approximation to the
EIR, defined as follows:

A number of significant judgments are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring
ECL, such as:

- Determining criteria for significant increase in credit risk (note 6.3.1);
- Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL;
- Establishing the number and relative weightings of forward-looking scenarios for each type of portfolio
and the associated ECL; and
- Establishing groups of similar financial assets for the purposes of measuring ECL.

The Group calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios (Base, best and worst) [after
deriving PDs based on forward looking information as detailed below] to measure the expected cash
shortfalls, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows
that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive.

# 51.1.1.4 The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:

PD The Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon.
A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been
previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among
credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk
ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). PDs for non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due
(DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information
from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate
forward looking information.

EAD The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into
account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of
principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on
committed facilities, and accrued profit from missed payments. The maximum period for which
the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Group
has the legal right to call it earlier. The Group’s product offering includes a variety of corporate and
retail facilities, in which the Group has the right to cancel and / or reduce the facilities with one day
notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Group does not limit its exposure to credit
losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the
Group’s expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the Group’s future
risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

LGD The Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs
at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those
that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually
expressed as a percentage of the EAD. Group has estimated segment wise LGDs for
Corporate/Commercial, SME & Agri Portfolio as well as product wise LGDs for House Finance,
Car Ijarah, Bike Ijarah and Consumer ease. The LGDs are determined using workout approach,
based on vintage recovery data for the defaulted portfolio; these recoveries are then discounted
back to date of default, to factor in time value of money.

The Group has converted the estimates for segment / product wise historical LGDs (Through the
cycle LGDs) into forward looking point in time LGDs, through use of term structure of Point in time
PDs.

# 51.1.1.5 ECL Principles, Grouping and Calculations

The ECL is determined by projecting the PD, LGD and EAD for each future repayment date and for each individual exposure. These three components are multiplied together, effectively calculating an ECL for each future repayment date, which is then discounted back to the reporting date and summed.

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective profit rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective profit rate (at reporting date), the Group uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date).

Effective profit rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

When estimating the ECLs, the Group considers three scenarios (base case, best case, worst case). Each of these is associated with different PDs. When relevant, the assessment of multiple scenarios also incorporates how defaulted financing are expected to be recovered, including the probability that the financing will cure and the value of collateral or the amount that might be received for selling the asset.

The Group considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics:

- History of legal certainty and enforceability
- History of enforceability and recovery.

The Group's management has only considered cash, liquid securities, gold, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals in the LGD calculation. All of these collaterals have a 0% haircut other than equity securities where haircut of 15% is applied.

The credit exposure (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

The SBP has issued FAQs in its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 with regard to certain interpretation of the SBP application instructions. In respect of Stage 3 provision, the SBP has clarified that the banks, while assessing the higher of IFRS 9 ECL and provision under the SBP Prudential Regulations, shall take into account the ECL against corporate / commercial / SME Islamic financing and related assets portfolios at the borrower / facility level, and for the retail borrowers at segment / product basis.

# 51.1.1.6 ECL Modelling and staging criteria / Significant increase in ECLs / Cooling off criteria and movement between stages

# 51.1.1.6.1 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

The Group has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Group considers an exposure (including profit accrued) to have significantly increased in credit risk when:

# Quantitative criteria

The Group considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than specified days.

# Qualitative criteria

- whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition based on internal ratings.
- The customer / facility has been placed on the watchlist rating.

For all the accounts with other banks (local / foreign), due from FIs and sovereign exposures (in foreign currency), external ratings falling below specified rating grade shall be considered as SICR and the exposure will be classified in stage 2.

Exposure below specified rating grade, at origination, will be considered in stage 2.

# Notes to and Forming Part of the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

# 51.1.1.6.2 Cooling off criteria

A customer classified as stage 2 will move to stage 1 if the following criteria is met and it does not meet SICR indicators at the reporting date.

|Reason for classification in Stage 2 (refer to SICR)|Move to Stage 1 when|
|---|---|
|Delinquency|Counterparty should not be delinquent as at reporting date. **|
|Restructured / rescheduling|Customer is regular as per Prudential Regulations for customers classified as Non-performing financing. *|
|Risk rating|As per the revised rating, the customer does not fall in the criteria of downgrading to Stage 2. *|

*A minimum cooling period is required, from meeting the relevant criteria, before any financial asset is moved back to Stage 1.

**A minimum cooling period or next payment made on due date, whichever is later, from meeting the relevant criteria has lapsed/ occurred before customer is moved back to Stage 1.

As a general rule, the underlying facility must have become regular, should be current and no longer meets the definition of credit impaired or is in default before it can be reclassified back from Stage 3.

Any upgrading of non-performing exposure to a performing status must be subject to a cooling off period of specified months. However, for financings classified as non-performing, cooling off period and other conditions specified in PRs will have to be complied with. If the facility has been regular during the cooling off period, it will move back to stage 2 after which the criteria for moving from stage 1 to stage 2 will be applied.

# 51.1.3 Credit Risk - General Disclosures

The Group has adopted Standardised Approach of Basel Accord for calculation of capital charge against credit risk. Therefore, risk weights for the credit risk related assets (on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet - market and non market related exposures) are assigned on basis of standardised approach.

The Group is committed to further strengthen its risk management framework which will enable the Group to move ahead for adopting Foundation Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach of Basel II. Meanwhile, none of the Bank's assets class is subject to the Foundation IRB or advanced IRB approaches.

# 51.1.3.1 Credit Risk: Disclosure for portfolio subject to the Standardised Approach

Under standardised approach the capital requirement is based on the credit rating assigned to the counterparties by the External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) duly recognised by the SBP for capital adequacy purposes. In this connection, the Group utilises the credit ratings assigned by ECAIs and has recognised agencies such as PACRA (Pakistan Credit Rating Agency) and VIS Credit Rating Company which are also recognised by the SBP.

In case of foreign currency exposures against banks, ratings assigned by S&P, Fitch and Moody’s have been applied.

# Notes to and Forming Part of the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For The Year Ended December 31, 2024

# Use of ECAI Ratings

The Bank prefers solicited ratings over unsolicited ratings at all times, owing to the greater degree of accuracy (in general) associated with solicited ratings. Unsolicited ratings may only be used in cases where a solicited rating is not available.

# Mapping to SBP Rating Grades

The alignment of the Alphanumerical scale of each agency is mapped with risk buckets in accordance with instructions laid down by SBP under Basel II requirements.

# 51.1.3.3 Credit Risk: Disclosures with respect to Credit risk mitigation for Standardised approach

The Group obtains capital relief for both its on-balance and off-balance sheet non-market related exposures by using simple approach for credit risk mitigation (CRM). Off-balance sheet items under the simplified standardised approach are converted into credit exposure equivalents through the use of credit conversion factors. Under the standardised approach the Group has taken advantage of the cash collaterals available with the Group in the form of security deposits, cash margins, certificates of Islamic investment, monthly mudaraba certificate, saving accounts, guarantees, shares and Government securities.

Valuation and management of eligible collaterals for CRM is being done in accordance with the conditions laid down by the State Bank of Pakistan. Eligible collaterals for CRM purposes do not expose the Group to price risk as they are in the form of cash/cash equivalent collaterals. Since eligible collaterals for CRM purposes are all in the form of cash/cash equivalent collaterals, they generally do not pose risk to the Group in terms of change in their valuation due to changes in the market condition.

The credit equivalent amount of an off-balance sheet market related foreign exchange contracts are determined by using the current exposure (mark to market) method.

The total benefit of Rs 490,707.642 million was availed through CRM against total on-balance sheet exposure of Rs 3,910,526.799 million. Under off-balance sheet, total benefit of Rs 20,875.550 million was availed by the Group through CRM against total off-balance sheet, non-market related exposure of Rs 1,609,796.379 million. In the year 2024, total CRM benefit was Rs 511,583.192 million as against amount of Rs 323,097.530 million in year 2023.

# 51.1.3.4 Credit concentration risk

Credit concentration risk arises mainly due to concentration of exposures under various categories viz., industry, geography, and single / group borrower obligor. Within credit portfolio, as a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of risks, the SBP has prescribed regulatory limits on banks’ maximum exposure to single and group obligors. Within the SBP limits, the Group has further defined limits to avoid excessive concentration of portfolio.

# 51.2 Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market prices. Market risk reflects yield rate risk, currency risk and other price risks. Banks could be adversely affected by movements in market rates or prices such as benchmark rates, deposit rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and market conditions resulting in a loss to earnings and capital.

# 51.2.1 Equity position in the banking and trading book

The Group classifies and values its investment portfolio in accordance with the IFRS 9, IFRS 13 and SBP directives as stated in note 6.2 to these consolidated financial statements.

# Trading book

The Group uses a number of methods to monitor and control market risk exposures. One of the major tools used by the Group to monitor and limit market risk is Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is defined as the estimated loss that will arise on a position or a portfolio over a particular (holding) period of time from an adverse market movement with a specific probability (confidence level). The VaR model used by the Group takes 99% confidence level and assumes a 1 to 10 days holding period whilst using the historical simulation taking the data of the last three years. Daily VaR figures are circulated to the senior management and regular summaries are reported in ALCO meetings.

The VaR reports are complemented by various other position and sensitivity limit structures, including stress, sensitivity, gap and scenario analysis. The capital charge for market risk has been calculated by using Standardized Approach.

# 51.2.3 Foreign exchange risk

The foreign exchange risk is defined as the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in currency exchange rates. It refers to the impact of adverse movement in currency exchange rates on the value of open foreign currency position. The objectives of the foreign exchange risk management is to minimise the adverse impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the assets and liabilities mismatch (tenor and position) and maximise their earnings.

Whenever a commercial bank deals in foreign currency, it is exposed to risk of exchange rate. The Group's assets and liabilities in foreign currencies give rise to foreign exchange risk which has to be managed by the Group; this risk is mitigated by using different hedging techniques. Hedging is a way used by a Group to eliminate or minimize its risk exposures. Hedging can be done using different ways like gap analysis, hedging (forwards), assigning limits in terms of amount, tenor, currency, product, countries, counterparties etc. The Group limits its currency exposure to the extent of statutory net open position prescribed by the SBP except in the cases where exemption is provided by the SBP. Foreign exchange open and mismatch positions are controlled through close monitoring and are marked to market on a daily basis.

# 51.2.5 Yield / profit rate risk

Yield risk occurs when there is a mismatch between positions, which are subject to profit rate alterations within a particular time period. The Group’s financing, placement and investment activities give rise to profit rate risk. The effect of changes in profit rate is on the Group’s income, and resultant impact is on the Group’s net worth.

Profit rate risk is primarily managed by monitoring the rate sensitive gaps and by having the pre-approved limits for repricing buckets. ALCO is the supervising body for adherence with these, complemented by the monitoring of sensitivity of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities to various scenarios.

The Group estimates changes in the market value of equity due to changes in the yield rates on on-balance sheet positions and their impact on capital adequacy ratio by conducting stress tests. It also assesses risk on earnings of the Group by various shocks.

# 51.3 Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss to the Group arising from either its inability to meet its obligations or to fund increases in assets as they fall due without incurring an unacceptable cost.

The Holding Company’s Board of Directors sets the Group’s policy for managing liquidity risk and entrusts accountability for supervision of the implementation of this strategy to senior management. Senior management exercises its responsibilities for managing market & liquidity risk through various committees including the Asset & Liability Management Committee (ALCO). Treasury department manages the Group’s liquidity position on a daily basis. The Group’s main approach of managing the liquidity risk is to make certain that it will always have adequate liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due in normal and stressed scenarios without incurring any untoward expenditure or risking reputational harm. ALCO monitors the maintenance of liquidity ratios, depositor's concentration both in terms of the overall funding mix and avoidance of undue reliance on large individual deposits. Regular liquidity stress testing is conducted under a variety of scenarios covering both normal and more severe market conditions.

# 51.3.3 Operational risk

The Group uses Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) for assessing the capital charge for operational risk. Under BIA the capital charge is calculated by multiplying average positive annual gross income of the Group over past three years with 15% as per guidelines issued by SBP under Basel II. To reduce losses arising from operational risk, the Group has strengthened its risk management framework by developing policies, strategies, guidelines and manuals. It also includes set up of functions like operational risk management, prevention of fraud and forgery and information security function, defining responsibilities of individuals, implementing four eye principle, enhancing security measures, improving efficiency and effectiveness of operations, outsourcing and improving quality of human resources through trainings and development.
