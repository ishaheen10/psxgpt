# DIRECTORS' REVIEW

The Board of Directors is pleased to present the condensed interim unaudited unconsolidated and consolidated financial statements of Meezan Bank Limited for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.

# Economy

Pakistan's macroeconomic and political landscape has been navigating a host of pressing challenges for the past two years, stemming from both domestic and international events. These challenges encompass the ripple effects of monetary tightening across all major economies, escalating global commodity prices especially after the start of Russia-Ukraine war, post-Covid supply chain disruptions being compounded by the events in the Middle East and domestic political volatility and fiscal issues. Despite these formidable obstacles, early signs of nascent economic recovery are now discernible, bolstered by prudent policymaking and reforms leading to influx of funds from multilateral and bilateral partners.

With a new government now in place and showing resolve to address the persistent issues undermining the country’s economic growth, confidence is gradually returning to the economy, albeit at a measured pace. This includes strengthening public finances through fiscal consolidation and expanding the tax base, alongside improvements in tax administration, restoring the viability of the energy sector and reforms in State Owned Enterprises. According to projections by the World Bank, Pakistan's real GDP is anticipated to expand by 1.8 percent in FY24, a notable improvement compared to (0.2) per cent in FY23.

The successful conclusion of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) programme in March 2024, marked by a Staff-Level Agreement with a $1.1 billion disbursement, provides significant support to the economy. Headline inflation is now on a downward trajectory, reaching a twenty-two-month low of 20.7 percent in March 2024 versus 35.4 percent in March 2023. However, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has opted to maintain the policy rate at 22 percent in its latest monetary policy statement announced in March 2024, citing risks to the inflation outlook. Measures taken to stabilize the Pakistani Rupee against the US Dollar, including structural reforms for Exchange Companies, have been effective. Consequently, the PKR remained stable during the first quarter of 2024, strengthening to PKR 277.9/US$ by the quarter end, compared to PKR 281.9/US$ at December 2023 year end. The Current Account reflects a deficit of $1.0 billion for Jul-Feb FY2024, a notable improvement from the $3.8 billion deficit recorded last year, primarily driven by import rationalisation.

The performance of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) remained upbeat in the initial three months of 2024, buoyed by political and economic stability. The PSX-100 index closed at 67,005 points, marking a gain of 4,554 points or 7% since December 2023 and 27,004 points or 68% from March 2023. Overall, the Pakistani economy appears to be on a path of recovery with decreasing inflation, the stabilized position of the PKR against USD and support from the IMF. The incumbent Government has indicated negotiating a larger and longer duration International Monetary Fund IMF programme in the next few months.

# Financial Highlights

With the blessings of Allah, Meezan Bank achieved commendable results for the first quarter of 2024. Profit after Tax surged to Rs 25.4 billion from Rs 15.4 billion in the corresponding quarter last year representing a remarkable growth of 65%. The Basic Earnings per Share clocked in at Rs 14.18 per share in March 2024 compared to Rs 8.62 per share - a year ago. The Bank’s Return on Equity (ROE) surpassed 50% demonstrating the Bank’s robust financial performance while Return on Assets (ROA) crossed 3%. Alhamdullillah, we have consistently maintained ROE above the banking industry average in line with our focus on value creation for our shareholders. Our steady growth in profitability coupled with prudent approach of striking a balance between dividend pay-outs and profit retention has led to strong internal capital generation, boasting a Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 20% plus.

We are pleased to announce that the Board has approved an interim cash dividend of Rs 7.00 (70%) for the first quarter ended on March 31, 2024. We take pride in our longstanding tradition of

consistently paying dividends every year since our listing on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Meezan maintained its position as the most valuable bank in Pakistan with a market capitalisation of $ 1.38 billion, closing the quarter at Rs 383 billion, which underscores the investors’ confidence in the Bank’s management team, performance and growth prospects. Below are the financial highlights of Meezan Bank:

# Statement of Financial Position

|Rupees in millions|March 31, 2024|December 31, 2023|Growth %|
|---|---|---|---|
|Total Assets|3,042,655|3,012,109|1%|
|Investments|1,626,292|1,572,388|3%|
|Islamic financing and related assets - Gross|930,822|992,027|(6%)|
|Deposits|2,270,072|2,217,474|2%|
|ADR (Gross Advances to Deposits)- %|41%|45%|(8%)|
|Equity|194,587|184,908|5%|

Returns from financing, investments and placements experienced a notable increase, reaching Rs 119 billion compared to Rs 82 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year, reflecting a significant growth of 45%. This growth was propelled by the higher underlying benchmark rate and a higher average volume of earning assets. Throughout the quarter, the Policy Rate averaged at 22% compared to 17.71% in March 2023, representing an increase of 429 basis points or 24%. Returns on deposits and other dues expensed, on the contrary, grew to Rs 51.6 billion from Rs 40.9 billion in March 2023, a rise of 26% primarily due to reduction in average borrowings from the SBP under Shariah Compliant Open Market Operations (OMO) and Standing Ceiling Facility (window). The average OMO and window borrowings dropped from Rs 420 billion in March 2023 to Rs 135 billion in the current quarter, depicting a decline of 68%. The return on deposits during the similar period increased from Rs 17.6 billion to Rs 36.5 billion reflecting a growth of 107%, attributable to both the rise in average deposit volumes as well as an uptick in depositors' profit rates. On an overall basis, our net spread increased to Rs 68 billion from Rs 41 billion in corresponding period last year, reflecting a rise of 65%.

Fee, commission and other income also demonstrated strong growth, increasing by 65% to reach Rs 6.4 billion from Rs 3.9 billion in March 2023. Core fee and commission income posted a robust rise of 40% clocking in at Rs 5.0 billion with key contributors being debit card, branch banking.

and trade related income. During the quarter, our debit card portfolio expanded with an addition of more than 246,000 cards, taking the total portfolio size to more than 3.4 million cards. Overall spend on debit cards surged from Rs 49.6 billion in first quarter of 2023 to Rs 70.9 billion in current quarter marking a substantial increase of 43%, with a remarkable fivefold increase in NFC transactions. Foreign exchange income grew to Rs 478 million compared to a loss of Rs 155 million in corresponding period last year due to stability in PKR during the current quarter and better trade flows.

Operating and other expenses rose from Rs 14.9 billion to Rs 21.2 billion, mainly attributable to high inflation, devaluation of the rupee, strategic investments in IT-related projects and increase in costs associated with branch expansion – an investment in future. However, the increase in expenses was offset by income growth, resulting in further enhancement of our income efficiency ratio which now stands at 29% versus 33% in March 2023. We remain steadfast in our commitment to cost rationalization and process automation strategies to attain a more efficient and streamlined operating cycle.

Total assets closed at Rs 3 trillion in line with December 2023 year end number. Investments portfolio expanded by 3% compared to the previous year, reaching Rs 1.63 trillion. This expansion can be directly attributed to the regular Sukuk auctions by the Government of Pakistan which has eased liquidity management challenges historically faced by Islamic Banking Industry (IBI).

In response to ongoing slowdown in private sector credit amid monetary tightening, Meezan has proactively moderated its credit lending activities, prioritizing the preservation of financing portfolio's quality. Consequently, gross financing portfolio decreased by 6% from Rs 992 billion as at December 2023 end to Rs 931 billion at the end of the current quarter, translating into an Advances to Deposits Ratio (ADR) of 41%. With the ADR related tax now being applicable, the Bank will strive to increase its finances ratio in order to meet its ADR targets.

We remain steadfast in our commitment to maintaining a high-quality and diversified asset mix, strategically allocated across various sectors including Corporate, Commercial & SME, and Consumer markets. In our strategic endeavours across SME and agriculture financing, Meezan is actively participating in various financing programs, including Islamic SME Aasaan Financing (ISAAF) scheme, farm mechanization, women entrepreneur, and financing facility for storage of agriculture produce. Through SBP's Farmer Literacy Program, Meezan organized Kissan Baithak "Farmer’s Gatherings" in rural communities, conducted Farmer Literacy Programs and provided financial support to farmers to acquire solar-powered tube well systems contributing to sustainable farming practices. Meezan Bank continues to uphold exemplary asset quality, surpassing industry standards with a non-performing financing ratio below 2%. Meezan maintains a comfortable level of provisions against our non-performing financings translating into a coverage ratio of more than 190%.

Deposits portfolio also remained aligned with last year-end numbers closing at Rs 2.27 trillion. Current Account (CA) deposits constitute nearly half of the deposit book, amounting to Rs 1.08 trillion while Current and Savings Account (CASA) deposits represent 89% of the total deposit book amounting to Rs 2.03 trillion. Meezan Bank has expanded its clientele by acquiring approximately 215,000 new-to-bank customers, thereby supplementing our existing deposit relationships.

Meezan Bank has been steadfast in its digital transformation strategy, aiming to enhance customer experiences and streamline back-office operations. Embracing a hybrid growth model, we have expanded our physical presence in underserved regions of the country while simultaneously onboarding customers digitally. Strategically dispersed across the nation, our branch network comprises of 1,007 branches across 334 cities, whereas our ATM network of over 1,100 touchpoints nationwide have facilitated transactions worth around Rs 517 billion. Additionally, our Merchant Acquiring Business spans over 20,000 POS terminals and over 300 E-commerce merchants across more than 320 cities. Notably, 45% of our overall Card Acquiring Business originates from SMEs vendors, showcasing our commitment to financial inclusion. During the first quarter of 2024, over 87 million financial transactions amounting to over Rs 4 trillion were executed through our.

Mobile App, setting a new benchmark for the banking industry in Pakistan.

The VIS Credit Rating Company Limited has reaffirmed Meezan with highest possible credit rating - 'AAA' (Triple A) rating for the Long Term and an 'A1+' (A-One Plus) rating for the Short Term, maintaining a stable outlook.

# Outlook

Meezan remains committed to fostering the economic growth and stability of the nation by strengthening the Islamic Banking Industry and aligning with the government's shift towards Islamic Finance, as guided by the Honourable Federal Shariat Court (FSC) directive to fully transition the economy into a Shariah-Compliant financial system. We aim to maintain a balanced growth strategy, diversifying sector exposures while surpassing regulatory stability thresholds. Our expansion efforts prioritize both physical and digital outreach, with a focus on providing top-tier digital services to maintain our leading position in the industry.

With heartfelt appreciation, gratitude and respect, we bid farewell to our Deputy Chief Executive Officer (DCEO), Mr Ariful Islam, who has been a cornerstone of our management team for the past 25 years. As we reflect on Arif’s remarkable tenure, we are reminded of his unwavering dedication, visionary leadership and tireless commitment that has propelled the Bank to one of the largest, Most Valuable and the Most Profitable Bank in the country. Under his stewardship, Meezan has not only achieved significant milestones but has also fostered a culture of innovation, collaboration and service excellence that define our banking practices. As Arif embarks on a new chapter in his life, we extend him our heartfelt gratitude and best wishes for the future. Though Mr Islam may be stepping away from his formal role, his impact and influence will continue to resonate within the Bank for years to come.

Syed Amir Ali, having rejoined the Bank this past October, is already infusing our operations with new vigour and insight and has formally resumed the charge as the DCEO of the Bank. Amir's proactive involvement fortifies our Vision and Mission and this unprecedented transition underscores our commitment to continuity, growth and innovation.

We extend our heartfelt appreciation to the State Bank of Pakistan, the Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan for their unwavering commitment to establishing a sustainable Islamic financial system in the country. Our significant accomplishments would not have been possible without the proactive support of our diverse customer base, to whom we are deeply indebted. We also express our gratitude to the Board of Directors, members of the Shariah Board, our shareholders, holders of Additional Tier I Sukuk and Subordinated Sukuk (Tier II) for their continuous patronage for establishing Meezan Bank as the leading Islamic Bank in the country.

We convey our appreciation to every member of our devoted team for their diligent efforts and steadfast dedication to furthering the mission of Islamic Banking. Above all, we humbly acknowledge and offer gratitude to Allah Almighty for His continuous blessings upon our Bank and each one of us, which have enabled our notable achievements within a relatively brief timeframe. We beseech Him for His continued support, granting us the fortitude and insight to continue advancing our vision of “establishing Islamic banking as the banking of first choice”.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2024

# 1 LEGAL STATUS AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

# 1.1

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2024

# 3.2 Significant accounting policies and financial risk management

# 3.2.1

The financial risk management objectives and policies adopted by the Bank are consistent with those disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 3.2.2

The significant accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of this condensed interim financial information are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the audited annual financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023 except as mentioned below:

# 3.2.2.1 Adoption of new forms for the preparation of condensed interim financial information

The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 09, 2023 and BPRD Circular No. 07 dated April 13, 2023, issued the revised forms for the preparation of the annual / interim financial information of the banks which are applicable for quarterly / half yearly periods beginning on or after January 01, 2024 (previously January 01, 2023). The implementation of the revised forms has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the condensed interim financial information. Right of use assets and corresponding lease liability are now presented separately on the face of Statement of financial position. Previously they were presented under Property and Equipment (previously titled Fixed Assets) and Other Liabilities respectively. As a result of this change, the Property and Equipment of the Bank decreased by Rs 19,549 million and Rs 19,572 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively. Further, Other liabilities of the Bank decreased by Rs 22,581 million and Rs 22,094 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively. The Bank has adopted the above changes in the presentation and made additional disclosures to the extent applicable to its operations and corresponding figures have been rearranged / reclassified to correspond to current year’s presentation (Note 40).

# 3.2.2.2 Amendments to approved accounting standards that are effective in the current period

There are certain new and amended standards that became effective during the period (enumerated in note 3.6 to the annual financial statement of the Bank). However, such standards did not have any significant effect on this condensed interim unconsolidated financial information except IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments), the impact of which is disclosed under Note 3.3.

# 3.3 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

As directed by the SBP via BPRD Circular no 7 of 2023, IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' is effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 (previously January 01, 2023) for banks having asset base of more than Rs. 500 billion as at December 31, 2022. Moreover, SBP has also issued application instructions on IFRS 9 for banks in Pakistan for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard in the banks.

IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of accounting for financial liabilities. To determine appropriate classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments to be assessed based on combination of the entity's business model for managing the assets and the instruments' contractual cash flow characteristics. The adoption of IFRS 9 has also fundamentally changed the impairment method of financial assets with a forward-looking Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach.

# 3.3.1 Classification

Under IFRS 9, existing categories of financial assets: Held for trading (HFT), Available for Sale (AFS) and Held to maturity (HTM) have been replaced by:

- Financial assets at amortized cost
- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss account (FVTPL)
---
# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

# FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2024

Under IFRS 9, the accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus all financial liabilities are being carried at Amortized cost. Financial liabilities can also be designated at FVTPL where gains or losses arising from entity's own credit rating risk relating to are required to be presented in other comprehensive income with no reclassification to profit or loss account. The Bank does not have any financial liability measured at FVTPL.

# 3.3.1.1 Business model assessment

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Bank's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realizing cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity's key management personnel;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank’s assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realized.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Bank's original expectations, the Bank does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:

- Hold to Collect (HTC) Business Model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash flows
- Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S) Business Model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
- Other Business Models: Resulting in classification of financial assets as FVTPL

# 3.3.1.2 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and profit (SPPI)

As a second step of its classification process the Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. ‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium/discount). The most significant elements of profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk.

To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the profit rate is set. In contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than de minimise exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic financing arrangement do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and profit on the amount outstanding. In such cases, the financial asset is required to be measured at FVTPL.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2024

# 3.3.1.3 Application to Bank's financial assets

# Debt based financial assets

Debt based financial assets held by the Bank (including, Islamic financing and related assets; investment in Federal government securities and other government / private sukuk; due from financial institutions; cash and balances with treasury banks; balances with other banks; and other financial assets) are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and profit on the principal amount outstanding.

The Bank’s business model for these financial assets can still be HTC even when sales of these financial assets occur. However, if more than an infrequent number of sales or sale(s) of significant value are/is made, the Bank assess whether and how the sales are consistent with the HTC objective. This assessment include the reason(s) for the sales, the expected frequency of sales, and whether the assets that are sold are held for an extended period of time relative to their contractual maturities.

Aforementioned financial assets are measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and profit on the principal amount outstanding.

Aforementioned financial assets if held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

The application of these policies also resulted in reclassifications and consequent remeasurements of certain amount of investments in GoP ijarah sukuk held under Available for Sale portfolio as of December 31, 2023 based on business model. Moreover, the Bank's investment in Sub-ordinated sukuk issued by other Banks under Available for Sale portfolio as of December 31, 2023 have been reclassified as FVTPL since they do not pass the SPPI criteria due to equity conversion features embedded in the terms of these sukuk.

|Balances as of December 31, 2023|IFRS 9 Classification|Balances as of January 01, 2024|Remeasurements before ECL|Balances as of January 01, 2024| |

# Equity based financial assets

An equity instrument held by the Bank for trading purposes is classified as measured at FVTPL. Gains and losses on equity instruments at FVTPL are included in the profit and loss account. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. The Bank has decided to classify its available for sale equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2023 as FVOCI on irrevocable basis.
---
# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2024

IFRS 9 has eliminated impairment assessment requirements for investments in equity instruments. Accordingly the Bank has reversed impairment of Rs 2,562 million on equity investment held as at December 31, 2023 and the same has been transferred to deficit on revaluation of investments through remeasurements.

The measurement category and carrying amount of financial assets in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan before and after adoption of IFRS 9 as at January 1, 2024 are compared as follows:

|Financial assets|Before adoption of IFRS 9|After adoption of IFRS 9| | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Measurement category|Carrying amount|Measurement category|(before ECL)| |
|Cash and balances with treasury banks|Loans and receivables|242,611,556|Amortised cost|242,611,556|
|Balances with other banks|Loans and receivables|11,452,256|Amortised cost|11,452,256|

|Other assets (financial assets only)|Loans and receivables|125,309,036|Amortised cost / FVOCI / FVTPL|125,309,036|
|Total|2,947,489,477| |2,954,605,237| |

# 3.3.1.4 Initial recognition and measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on trade date, the date on which the Bank purchase or sell the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like Islamic financing and related assets, due from financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognized when funds are transferred to the customers’ account or financial institutions or as per underlying Shariah mode. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased. The Bank will recognize due to customer and financial institution balances when these funds reach the Bank.

# Amortized Cost

Financial assets and liabilities under Amortized Cost category are initially recognized at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. They are subsequently measured at Amortized Cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognized for financial assets in profit or loss. Rental / profit income / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognized in profit or loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss will be recognized in profit or loss account.

# Fair value through Other Comprehensive Income

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognized at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These assets are subsequently measured at Fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognized for these financial assets in profit or loss. Rental / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognized in profit or loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognized in profit or loss account only in case of debt instruments.

# Fair value through Profit or Loss

Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognized at fair value. Transaction cost will be directly recorded in profit or loss. These assets are subsequently measured at Fair value with changes recorded in profit or loss. Rental / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognized in profit or loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognized in profit or loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognized for these financial assets.

Bank's revenue recognition policy is consistent with the annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 3.3.1.5 Derecognition

# Financial assets

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised (Note 3.3.1.6).

# Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.

# 3.3.1.6 Modification

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of financing to customers. When the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified and the renegotiation or modification does not result in the derecognition of that financial asset in accordance with IFRS 9, the Bank recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset and shall recognise a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. The gross carrying amount of the financial asset shall be recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial asset’s original effective profit rate (or credit-adjusted effective profit rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets). Any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

# 3.3.2 Overview of the ECL principles

The Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with all Islamic financing and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilized financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Bank recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- The time value of money; and
- Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL) as outlined below.

The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at individual customer level.
---
# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2024

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject customer. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 60 days past due. However, for certain portfolios, the Bank has rebutted 60 DPD presumption based on behavioural analysis of its borrowers. When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Bank applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its financial instruments into Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3 and POCI, as described below:

# Stage 1:

When financial instruments are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and they have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

# Stage 2:

When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

# Stage 3:

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises the lifetime expected credit losses for these instruments. The Bank uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP under the prudential regulations whichever is higher.

# POCI:

Purchased or originated credit impaired (POCI) assets are financial assets that are credit impaired on initial recognition. POCI assets are recorded at fair value at original recognition and profit/rental is subsequently recognised based on a credit-adjusted EIR. ECLs are only recognised or released to the extent that there is a subsequent change in the expected credit losses.

# Undrawn financing commitments:

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected shortfalls in cash flows if the financings is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted at an approximation to the expected EIR on the financings. For revolving facilities that include both a financings and an undrawn commitment, ECLs are calculated and presented together with the financings. For financings commitments and letters of credit, the ECL is recognised within Provisions.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

# FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2024

# Guarantee and letters of credit contracts

The Bank estimates ECLs based on the present value of the expected payments to reimburse the holder for a credit loss that it incurs. The shortfalls are discounted by the risk-adjusted discount rate relevant to the exposure. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within Other liabilities.

# For receivables on account of refundable security deposits

Settlement of transactions (including those originated from Alternative Distribution Channels); services rendered to customers (including related parties) etc., the Bank applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognized from the initial recognition of these receivables.

# The calculation of ECLs

The Bank calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash shortfalls, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive.

# The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:

# PD

The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the past 7 years. PDs for Non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.

# EAD

The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has the legal right to call it earlier. The Bank’s product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail facilities, in which the Bank has the right to cancel and/or reduce the facilities with one day’s notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Bank does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the Bank’s expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the Bank’s future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

# LGD

The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD.

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective profit rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective profit rate (at reporting date), the Bank uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date).

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three scenarios (a base case, an upside, a downside). Each of these is associated with different PDs. When relevant, the assessment of multiple scenarios also incorporates how defaulted financing are expected to be recovered, including the probability that the loans will cure and the value of collateral or the amount that might be received for selling the asset.
---
# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2024

# Forward looking information

In its ECL models, the Bank relies on a range of forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

- GDP growth
- Volume of exports of goods
- Consumer Price Index
- Unemployment rate

To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The bank considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics:

- History of legal certainty and enforceability
- History of recoverability

The Bank's management has only considered cash, liquid Securities, gold, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals in the LGD calculation. All of these collaterals have a 0% Haircut other than Equity securities where a haircut of 15% is applied.

# 3.3.3 Definition of default

The Bank defines a financial instrument as in default, which is fully aligned with the definition of credit impaired, when it meets one or more of the following criteria:

- The customer is more than 90 days past due on its contractual payments, except in case of agriculture, project infrastructure and housing financing.

Further the following qualitative criteria has been determined for assessment of default:

- The Bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realizing security (if held).
- The Bank makes a charge-off or account-specific provision resulting from a perceived decline in credit quality subsequent to the Bank taking on the exposure.
- The Bank consents to a distressed restructuring of the credit obligation where this is likely to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by the material forgiveness, or postponement, of principal, interest or (where relevant) fees.
- The obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection where this would avoid or delay repayment of the credit obligation to the industry group.

# 3.3.4 Write-offs

The Bank’s accounting policy under IFRS 9 remains the same as it was under SBP regulations.

# Forborne and modified financings

The Bank sometimes makes concessions or modifications to the original terms of financings as a response to the borrower’s financial difficulties, rather than taking possession or to otherwise enforce collection of collateral. The Bank considers a financing forborne when such concessions or modifications are provided as a result of the borrower’s present or expected financial difficulties and the Bank would not have agreed to them if the borrower had been financially healthy. Indicators of financial difficulties include defaults on covenants, or significant concerns raised by the Credit Risk Department. Forbearance may involve extending the payment arrangements and the agreement of new financing conditions. Once the terms have been renegotiated, any impairment is measured using the original EIR as calculated before the modification of terms. It is the Bank’s policy to monitor forborne financing to help ensure that future payments continue to be likely to occur. Derecognition decisions and classification between Stage 2 and Stage 3 are determined on a case-by-case basis. If these procedures identify a loss in relation to a financing, it is disclosed and managed as an impaired Stage 3 forborne asset until it is collected or written off.

The additions / disallowances were mainly due to allocation of expenses relating to dividends and capital gain, allowability of provision against loans and advances, provision against investments and provision against other assets. In the amended order for tax year 2015, additional issues with respect to the taxability of gain on bargain purchase and non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East – Pakistan Branches have also been raised. The Bank has obtained stay order from the High Court of Sindh against the demands raised through the amended order for the tax year 2015. Both the Bank and the department have filed appeals with the Appellate Authorities in respect of the aforementioned matters.

The management of the Bank, in consultation with its tax advisors, is confident that the decision in respect of the above matters would be in Bank’s favour and accordingly no provision has been made in these unconsolidated financial statements with respect thereto. The additional tax liability in respect of gain on bargain purchase and non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East – Pakistan Branches is Rs 1,096 million and Rs 706 million respectively.

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as Amortized cost, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as amortized cost are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of an appropriate valuation model or alternatively break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 36.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

|Total|36,320| | | | |

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfactions of claims are carried at revalued amounts (level 3 measurement) determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values. The valuation has been determined through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange. The fair value of GoP sukuk listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange has been determined through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange. The fair value of other GoP Ijarah Sukuk quoted are derived using PKISRV rates. The PKISRV rates are announced by FMA (Financial Market Association) through Reuters. The rates announced are simple average of quotes received from eight different pre-defined / approved dealers / brokers. The valuation has been determined through closing rates of Bloomberg. The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mid rates announced by SBP.

# Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy. The valuation has been determined based on Net asset values declared by respective funds.

# Unquoted Equity Securities

Dividend discount model using a constant dividend stream and terminal value (if determinable). For unquoted equity securities, where no reliable data is available, break-up value determined on the basis of NAV of the company using the latest available audited financial statements.

The Bank's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the quarter.

Fair value of Islamic financing and related assets, unquoted sukuk, other assets, other liabilities and fixed term deposits and other accounts and due to financial institutions cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of Islamic financing and related assets has been made in accordance with the Bank’s accounting policy as stated in note 6.3.2 to the 2023 annual financial statements. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these assets and liabilities are short term in nature or in the case of financings and deposits are frequently repriced.
