# DIRECTORS' REVIEW

The Board of Directors is pleased to present the condensed interim unaudited unconsolidated and consolidated financial statements of Meezan Bank Limited for the half year ended June 30, 2024.

# Economy

Pakistan's economy has shown signs of recovery in Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 following a contraction in FY2023. Prudent policies and administrative measures by the Federal Government have restored market confidence, leading to increased economic activity. Initiatives such as strengthening public finances through fiscal consolidation, broadening the tax base, enhancing tax administration, restoring sustainability in the energy sector and reforming State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) have been pivotal. Through substantial agricultural growth, decreased inflationary pressures and improved current account balance, GDP growth accelerated to 2.4% in FY2024.

The average CPI for FY 2024 remained around 26%, however, the significant decline in inflation since February 2024 prompted the SBP to decrease the policy rate first by 150 bps in June 2024 and then by another 100 bps bringing the policy rate to 19.50% by the end of July 2024. The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) also continued its robust ascent, posting significant growth of 26% with the PSX-100 Index closing at 78,444 points at the end of June 2024 from 62,451 points in December 2023, emerging as one of the best-performing indices globally, attributed to political stability, improved economic fundamentals and positive market sentiments.

The total foreign exchange reserves of Pakistan rose to $14 billion in June 2024 versus $9 billion in June 2023. This increase has stabilized the PKR/USD exchange rate, further supported by structural reforms for Exchange Companies and the successful completion of a $3 billion Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) programme with the IMF. Resultantly, the PKR maintained stability throughout the first half of 2024, strengthening to PKR 278.3 per US Dollar by the end of June 2024, compared to PKR 281.9 per US Dollar at the end of December 2023.

On the external front, the Government successfully reduced the trade deficit through higher exports and imports rationalisation, leading to a substantial decrease in the current account deficit. Worker remittances remained a critical source of foreign exchange reserves with positive trends emerging post-structural reforms for Exchange Companies narrowing the parity between exchange rates in the interbank and open markets. Post June 2024, the Federal Government and the IMF have reached a staff-level agreement on a 37-month Extended Fund Facility Arrangement (EFF) of about US$7 billion subject to approval by the IMF’s Executive Board. The programme aims to leverage the macroeconomic stability achieved over the past year.

Overall, following two turbulent years, the country’s economy is showing signs of stabilization with the potential favourable conclusion of a new IMF programme which is expected to result in further macroeconomic improvements in the long run.

# Financial Highlights

With the Grace of Allah SWT, Meezan Bank has achieved impressive results for the first half of 2024. The Profit after Tax surged by 59%, reaching Rs 51.8 billion from Rs 32.6 billion in the corresponding period last year. This translates into Basic Earnings per Share of Rs 28.89 in June 2024, compared to Rs 18.21 in the same period last year. The Bank's Return on Average Equity (ROAE) exceeded 50%, highlighting our robust financial performance, while Return on Average Assets (ROAA) surpassed 3%. Our strategy of balanced dividend pay-outs and profit retention has resulted in strong internal capital generation, reflected in a Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) in excess of 20%.

We are delighted to announce that the Board has approved an interim cash dividend of Rs 7.00 (70%) for the second quarter of 2024. This decision brings the total dividend payout to Rs 14.00 (140%) for the half-year 2024, inclusive of Rs 7.00 per share (70%) interim cash dividend disbursed in the first quarter of 2024. Our unwavering commitment to shareholders is underscored by our longstanding tradition of consistently paying dividends yearly since our listing on the Pakistan.

# DIRECTORS' REVIEW

Stock Exchange.

Below are the financial highlights of Meezan Bank:

# Statement of Financial Position

|Rupees in millions|June 30, 2024|December 31, 2023|
|---|---|---|
|Total Assets|3,296,362|3,012,109|
|Investments|1,644,261|1,572,388|
|Islamic financing and related assets - Gross|1,152,004|992,027|

|ADR (Gross Advances to Deposits)- %|48%|45%|
|Equity|208,528|184,908|

The return from financing, investments and placements grew by 36% to Rs 249 billion compared to Rs 183 billion in June 2023 driven by a higher underlying average SBP policy rate and a larger average volume of earning assets. Throughout the first half of 2024, the SBP policy averaged at 21.84%, up from 19.36% in June 2023. Returns on deposits and other dues expensed rose from Rs 92.4 billion in June 2023 to Rs 111.5 billion in the current period, reflecting a 21% increase over the same period last year. Average deposits witnessed an uptick of 26% expanding from Rs 1.77 trillion in corresponding period last year to Rs 2.24 trillion in the current period. Overall, our net spread increased to Rs 138 billion from Rs 91 billion in the corresponding period last year, reflecting a robust increase of 52%.

Fee, commission and other income showed strong growth, rising by 30% to Rs 11.7 billion by mid-year, compared to Rs 9 billion in June 2023. Core fees and commission income expanded by 22%, totalling Rs 9.5 billion, driven primarily by contributions from debit card services, branch banking and trade-related income. During the half year, our debit card portfolio increased by more than 500,000 cards on a gross basis, taking the total portfolio size to more than 3.5 million cards. Debit card spending rose by 36%, with Near Field Communication (NFC) transactions increasing by 186%. Domestic spend on debit cards also surged to Rs 116.4 billion in the half year 2024 as compared to Rs 79.2 billion in half year 2023, which is a significant increase of 47%.

# DIRECTORS' REVIEW

The Bank continued to make strides in its Home Remittance services with 40% increase in remittance volumes compared to the same period previous year. Foreign exchange income increased to Rs 580 million from Rs 541 million in the same period last year, marking a growth of 7% while dividend income doubled to Rs 918 million from Rs 458 million in June 2023, primarily driven by healthy distribution from investment in shares and mutual funds.

Operating expenses rose by 38% from Rs 31.3 billion in June 2023 to Rs 43.4 billion in the current half-year period. This uptick in expenses is primarily attributed to sustained inflationary pressures throughout the period, along with strategic investments in IT projects and the costs associated with expanding our branch network—an investment in our future growth. Despite these higher expenses, our income growth effectively mitigated their impact, resulting in a strengthened income efficiency ratio of 29%, compared to 31% in the corresponding period last year. Notwithstanding the improvement in cost efficiency ratio, the Bank remains committed to pursuing its cost rationalization and process automation strategy.

Total assets reached Rs 3.3 trillion, marking a 9% increase compared to the year-end 2023 figure of Rs 3 trillion. Similarly, the investment portfolio grew by 5%, rising to Rs 1.64 trillion from Rs 1.57 trillion at the end of 2023. This growth is largely attributable to ongoing Sukuk auctions conducted by the Government of Pakistan, which have alleviated traditional liquidity management challenges within the Islamic Banking Industry (IBI).

The Federal Government, under Finance Bill 2024 has not extended the exemption for Gross Advances-to-Deposits Ratio (ADR) related tax which was allowed to the banking sector for tax year 2023. As a result, with ADR tax being effective again, the Bank will strive to achieve Gross ADR at fifty percent (50%) plus levels while maintaining its asset quality preservation stance and keeping in check all the risk acceptance parameters. As of the mid-year mark, the gross financing portfolio reached Rs 1.15 trillion, marking a 16% increase compared to the year-end 2023 figure of Rs 992 billion. Consequently, the Gross ADR has risen to 48% up from 45% at the end of 2023.

At the same time, the Bank continues to maintain a high-quality asset portfolio, signified by having one of the lowest non-performing financing ratios in the industry of below 1.5% as at the half-year end 2024. Meezan also continues to maintain a significantly high level of provisions against its non-performing financing portfolio, which translated into a coverage ratio of 192% as of June 2024.

Meezan Bank has demonstrated robust performance in Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) banking. The Bank's SME portfolio increased by more than 20%, supported by initiatives like Islamic SME Asaan Finance Scheme (ISAAF), Prime Minister's Youth Business and Agriculture Loan Scheme (PMYBL&ALS), and Islamic Refinance Facility for Modernization of SMEs under the SBP incentive schemes. We also launched innovative digital financing solutions like the Digital Supply Chain Solution, Wisaaq, in collaboration with Haball. Agri Financing disbursed ~Rs 1.3 billion to sugar mills, benefiting over 1,000 farmers. Meezan remains committed to growing its financings portfolio across all sectors of the economy including top-tier Corporates, mid and small tier Commercial and SME clients as well as the Consumer segment.

The Bank’s deposits portfolio grew by 9% to Rs 2.41 trillion as compared to Rs 2.22 trillion at the year-end 2023. The Current Account (CA) deposit portfolio stood at Rs. 1.13 trillion as of the half year end 2024 while Savings Account (SA) portfolio experienced an increase of 19% (Rs. 166 billion) crossing Rs 1 trillion in the half year period. Collectively, Current and Saving Account (CASA) deposits reached Rs 2.18 trillion as of the half year end representing 90% of the Bank’s total deposit portfolio. Over the course of the half year, Meezan further expanded its client base through the addition of approximately 465,000 new-to-bank customers, thereby enhancing our portfolio of deposit relationships. Meezan’s Roshan Digital Account continues to grow at an astounding pace. The Bank maintained its leading position in the industry with total inflows of USD 2.19 billion (26% of total industry inflows) as at the half year end 2024. Over 110,000 Meezan RDA accounts are currently operational providing seamless banking services to the Pakistani diaspora members residing in more than 144 countries around the globe.

# DIRECTORS' REVIEW

Following a hybrid growth model, we are expanding our physical footprint while accelerating digital customer onboarding processes. By the end of the half-year, our strategically spread branch network comprised of 1,010 branches across 335 cities, complemented by an extensive ATM network with over 1,100 touchpoints nationwide. Our ATM machines are biometric-enabled and offer Tap and Withdraw services, allowing customers to access ATM services with a simple tap of their NFC-enabled debit cards. Moreover, the Bank’s Merchant Acquiring Business spans over 22,000 POS terminals and includes partnerships with over 800 e-commerce merchants across 326 cities. Almost 45% of the Bank’s overall Card Acquiring Business originates from SMEs vendors, showcasing its commitment to financial inclusion. Our state-of-the-art Mobile Banking App continues to provide a seamless platform for customers to carry out their digital transactions in a secure and efficient manner. Meezan Bank’s leadership position in digital transactions by retail customers is also mirrored by 1-Link's Monthly Ranking Reports consistently ranking Meezan Bank as the number one bank in terms of overall digital transactions passing through 1Link’s grid. We remain committed to our digital transformation strategy, which focuses on enhancing customer experiences and optimizing operations.

The VIS Credit Rating Company Limited has reaffirmed Meezan with the highest possible credit rating - 'AAA' (Triple A) rating for the Long Term and an 'A1+' (A-One Plus) rating for the Short Term, maintaining a stable outlook.

# Outlook

Meezan is steadfast in its commitment to bolstering the economic growth and stability of the nation through the enhancement of the Islamic Banking Industry. We are aligned with the Government’s strategic pivot towards Islamic Finance, following the directive of the Honourable Federal Shariat Court (FSC) to fully transition the economy to a Shariah-Compliant financial system. Our strategy emphasizes balanced growth, diversification across sectors and surpassing regulatory stability benchmarks. We are expanding our footprint through both physical and digital channels, with a strong emphasis on delivering premier digital services to sustain our leadership in the industry.

We extend our heartfelt appreciation to the State Bank of Pakistan, the Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan for their unwavering commitment to establishing a sustainable Islamic financial system in the country. Our significant accomplishments would not have been possible without the proactive support of our diverse customer base, to whom we are deeply indebted. We also express our gratitude to the Board of Directors, members of the Shariah Board, our shareholders, holders of Additional Tier I Sukuk and Subordinated Sukuk (Tier II) for their continuous patronage for establishing Meezan Bank as the leading Islamic Bank in the country.

We convey our appreciation to every member of our devoted team for their diligent efforts and steadfast dedication to furthering the mission of Islamic Banking. Above all, we humbly acknowledge and offer gratitude to Allah Almighty for His continuous blessings upon our Bank and each one of us, which have enabled our notable achievements within a relatively brief timeframe. We beseech Him for His continued support, granting us the fortitude and insight to continue advancing our vision of “establishing Islamic banking as the banking of first choice”.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF MEEZAN BANK LIMITED

# Report on review of condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements

# Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying condensed interim unconsolidated statement of financial position of Meezan Bank Limited (“the Bank”) as at June 30, 2024 and the related condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account, condensed interim unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, condensed interim unconsolidated statement of changes in equity and condensed interim unconsolidated cash flow statement, and notes to the condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements for the half year then ended (here-in-after referred to as the "interim financial statements"). Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim financial statements in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements based on our review.

The figures for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 in the condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account and condensed interim unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income have not been subject to review and therefore, we do not express a conclusion thereon.

# Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity". A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

# Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor’s review report is Shahbaz Akbar.

The Bank was registered as an ‘Investment Finance Company’ on August 8, 1997, and carried on the business of investment banking as permitted under SRO 585(I)/87 dated July 13, 1987, in accordance and in conformity with the principles of Islamic Shariah. A ‘Certificate of Commencement of Business' was issued to the Bank on September 29, 1997.

# 1.2

The Bank was granted a ‘Scheduled Islamic Commercial Bank’ license on January 31, 2002 and formally commenced operations as a Scheduled Islamic Commercial Bank with effect from March 20, 2002, on receiving notification in this regard from the State Bank of Pakistan (the SBP) under section 37 of the State Bank of Pakistan Act, 1956. Currently, the Bank is engaged in corporate, commercial, consumer, investment and retail banking activities.

# 1.3

The Bank was operating through one thousand and ten branches as at June 30, 2024 (December 31, 2023: one thousand and four branches). Its registered office is at Meezan House, C-25, Estate Avenue, SITE, Karachi, Pakistan.

# 1.4

The VIS Credit Rating Company Limited (VIS) has reaffirmed the Bank's medium to long-term rating as 'AAA' and short-term rating as 'A1+' on June 28, 2024 (2023: 'AAA' and 'A1+' dated June 27, 2023).

The Bank provides Islamic financing and related assets mainly through Murabaha, Istisna, Tijarah, Ijarah, Diminishing Musharakah, Running Musharakah, Bai Muajjal, Musawammah, Service Ijarah, Wakalah, Wakalah Tul Istithmar including under Islamic Export Refinance Scheme and various long term islamic refinancing facilities of the State Bank of Pakistan respectively.

The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these unconsolidated financial statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilised and the appropriate portion of profit thereon. The income on such financing is recognised in accordance with the principles of Islamic Shariah. However, income, if any, received which does not comply with the principles of Islamic Shariah is recognised as charity payable if so directed by the Resident Shariah Board Member (RSBM) of the Bank.

# 3 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

# 3.1

These condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. The accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting comprise of:

- International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;

These condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements are presented in Pakistani Rupees, which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency.

# 4.3 Rounding off

Figures have been rounded off to the nearest thousand rupees unless otherwise stated.

# 4.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The basis for accounting estimates adopted in the preparation of these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements are the same as that applied in the preparation of the annual audited unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for changes mentioned in notes 5.2.

# 5 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES

The material accounting policies applied in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the annual audited unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for changes mentioned in notes 5.1 and 5.2. The financial risk management objectives and policies adopted by the Bank are consistent with those disclosed in the annual audited unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 5.1 Adoption of new forms for the preparation of condensed interim financial statements

The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 09, 2023 and BPRD Circular No. 07 dated April 13, 2023, issued the revised formats of the annual / interim financial statements which are applicable for the preparation of condensed interim quarterly / half yearly financial statements, periods beginning on or after

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

January 01, 2024 (previously January 01, 2023). The implementation of the revised formats has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the condensed interim financial statements. The significant change is that the right of use assets and corresponding lease liability are now presented separately on the face of statement of financial position. Previously, these were presented under property and equipment (previously titled fixed assets) and other liabilities respectively. As a result of this change, the property and equipment of the Bank decreased by Rs 19,981 million and Rs 19,572 million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively. Furthermore, other liabilities of the Bank decreased by Rs 23,577 million and Rs 22,094 as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively. There is no impact of this change on the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements in terms of recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities.

The Bank has adopted the above changes in the presentation and made additional disclosures to the extent applicable to its operations and corresponding figures have been rearranged / reclassified to correspond to current period presentation, as presented in note 40.

# 5.2 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

As directed by the SBP via BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 17, 2023, IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' is effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 (previously January 01, 2023) for banks having asset base of more than Rs. 500 billion as at December 31, 2022. Moreover, SBP has also issued application instructions on IFRS 9 for banks in Pakistan for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard in the banks.

IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of accounting for financial liabilities. To determine appropriate classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments, to be assessed based on combination of the entity's business model for managing the assets and the instruments' contractual cash flow characteristics. The adoption of IFRS 9 has also fundamentally changed the impairment method of financial assets with a forward-looking Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach.

'The SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 has made certain amendments and extended the timelines of SBP's IFRS 9 Application Instructions to address most of the matters raised by the banks with a direction to ensure compliance by the extended timelines.

There are a few matters which include income recognition on islamic financings, maintenance of general provision, and fair valuation of subsidised financings, the treatments of which are still under deliberation with the SBP. The Bank has continued to follow the treatment adopted in respect of these matters in the prior periods till the time SBP issues the relevant guidance / clarification.

# 5.2.1 Classification

Financial assets

Under IFRS 9, existing categories of financial assets: Held for Trading (HFT), Available for Sale (AFS) and Held to Maturity (HTM) and loans and receivables have been replaced by:

- Financial assets at amortised cost
- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss account (FVTPL)

Financial liabilities

Under IFRS 9, the accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus all financial liabilities are being carried at amortised cost. Financial liabilities can also be designated at FVTPL where gains or losses arising from entity's own credit rating risk relating to, are required to be presented in other comprehensive income with no reclassification to profit or loss account. The Bank does not have any financial liability measured at FVTPL.

# 5.2.2 Business model assessment

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Bank's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;

- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity's key management personnel;

- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and

- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank’s assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Bank's original expectations, the Bank does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.

Securities held for trading are held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term or are part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. These securities are classified in the 'other' business model and measured at FVTPL.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:

1. Hold to Collect (HTC) Business Model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash flows.
2. Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S) Business Model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
3. Other Business Models: Resulting in classification of financial assets as FVTPL.

# 5.2.3 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and profit (SPPI)

As a second step of its classification process the Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. ‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium / discount). The most significant elements of profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the profit rate is set. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with basic financing arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL.

# 5.2.4 Application to Bank's financial assets

Debt based financial assets

Debt based financial assets held by the Bank includes: Islamic financing and related assets, investment in federal government securities and other government / private sukuk, due from financial institutions, cash and balances with treasury banks; balances with other banks; and other financial assets.

a) These are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- - the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- - the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and profit on the principal amount outstanding.

The Bank’s business model for these financial assets can still be HTC even when sales of these financial assets occur. However, if more than an infrequent number of sale of significant value are made, the Bank assess whether and how the sales are consistent with the HTC objective. This assessment include the reasons for the sales, the expected frequency of sales, and whether the assets that are sold are held for an extended period of time relative to their contractual maturities.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

# FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

b) Aforementioned financial assets are measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and are not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and profit on the principal amount outstanding.

c) Aforementioned financial assets, if held for trading purposes are measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

The application of these policies also resulted in classifications and consequent remeasurements of certain investments in GoP ijarah sukuk held under available for sale portfolio as of December 31, 2023 based on business model. Moreover, the Bank's investment in sub-ordinated sukuks issued by other Banks under available for sale portfolio as of December 31, 2023 have been reclassified as FVTPL since they do not pass the SPPI criteria due to equity conversion features embedded in the terms of these sukuks. Additionally, the Bank, has elected to classify investment in Islamic Naya Pakistan Certificates (previously classified under Available for Sale portfolio) as at December 31, 2023 at FVTPL.

The following table reconciles their carrying amounts as reported on December 31, 2023 to the carrying amounts under IFRS 9 on transition to IFRS 9 on January 01, 2024:

|Investment type and category|Balances as of December 31, 2023| | |Remeasurements|Balances as of January 01, 2024|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|IFRS 9 Classification| | |Rupees in ‘000| | |
|- Federal Government Sukuk - AFS| |FVTPL|1,202,500,730|10,473,351|10,473,351|
| | |Amortized Cost|124,801,022|-|124,801,022|

| | |FVTPL|1,083,000|-|1,083,000|

Equity based financial assets

Equity instruments are instruments that meet the definition of equity from the issuer's perspective; that is, instruments that do not contain a contractual obligation to pay and that evidence a residual share in the issuer's net assets.

The Bank measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, except where the Bank's management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Bank's policy is to designate equity investments as FVOCI when those investments are held for purposes other than for trading. When this election is used, fair value gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to the unconsolidated statement profit and loss account, including on disposal. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return on such investments, continue to be recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account as income when the Bank's right to receive payments is established.

IFRS 9 has eliminated impairment assessment requirements for investments in equity instruments. Accordingly, the Bank has reversed impairment of Rs 2,562 million on equity investment held as at December 31, 2023 and the same has been transferred.

to deficit on revaluation of investments through remeasurements. Gains and losses on equity instruments at FVTPL are included in the ‘Gain on sales of securities’ line in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# Measurement Category and Carrying Amounts of Financial Assets

in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan before and after adoption of IFRS 9 as at January 1, 2024 are compared as follows:

|Financial assets|Before adoption of IFRS 9|After adoption of IFRS 9| | |

# 5.2.5 Initial Recognition and Subsequent Measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Bank purchase or sell the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like Islamic financing and related assets, due from financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account or financial institutions or as per underlying Shariah mode. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased. The Bank will recognise due to customer and financial institution balances when these funds reach the Bank.

# a) Amortised Cost (AC)

Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Rental / profit income / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss will be recognised in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# b) Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for these financial assets in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Rental / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account only in case of debt instruments. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is transferred from surplus / deficit on revaluations of assets to unappropriated profit.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

# c) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost will be directly recorded in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Rental / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in condensed interim unconsolidated profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

# 5.2.6 Derecognition

# Financial assets

Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and either (i) the Bank transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or (ii) the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and the Bank has not retained control. The Bank enters into transactions where it retains the contractual rights to receive cash flows from assets but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to other entities and transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards. These transactions are accounted for as 'pass through' transfers that result in derecognition if the Bank:

1. Has no obligation to make payments unless it collects equivalent amounts from the assets;
2. Is prohibited from selling or pledging the assets; and
3. Has an obligation to remit any cash it collects from the assets without material delay.

Collateral (shares and sukuks) furnished by the Bank under due from and due to institutions are not derecognised because the Bank retains substantially all the risks and rewards on the basis of the predetermined repurchase price, and the criteria for derecognition are therefore not met.

# Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are derecognised when these are extinguished (i.e. when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires). The exchange between the Bank and its original participants of debt instruments with substantially different terms, as well as substantial modifications of the terms of existing financial liabilities, are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The terms are substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net of any fees received and discounted using the original effective interest rate, is at least 10% different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. In addition, other qualitative factors, such as the currency that the instrument is denominated in, changes in the type of profit rate, new conversion features attached to the instrument and change in covenants are also taken into consideration.

If an exchange of debt instruments or modification of terms is accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the extinguishment. If the exchange or modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified liability.

# 5.2.7 Financial guarantee contracts

Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Such financial guarantees are given to banks, financial institutions and others on behalf of customers to secure loans, overdrafts and other banking facilities.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

# 5.2.8 Modification

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of financing to its customers. When the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified and the renegotiation or modification does not result in the derecognition of that financial asset in accordance with IFRS 9, the Bank recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset and shall recognise a modification gain or loss in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. The gross carrying amount of the financial asset is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial asset’s original effective profit rate (or credit-adjusted effective profit rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets). Any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

# 5.2.9 Overview of the expected credit loss (ECL) principles

The Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with Islamic financing and related assets and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Bank recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- The time value of money; and
- Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL) as outlined below.

The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject customer. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 60 days past due. However, for certain portfolios, the Bank rebuts 60 DPD presumption based on behavioural analysis of its borrowers. When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Bank applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

# IFRS 9 outlines a 'three-stage' model for impairment based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition as summarised below:

# Stage 1:

When financial instruments are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and they have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure at default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected Loss given default (LGD) and discounted by an approximation to the original effective profit rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

# Stage 2:

When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but probability of default (PD) are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

# Stage 3:

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises the lifetime expected credit losses for these instruments. The Bank uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP under the prudential regulations whichever is higher.

# Purchased or originated credit impaired (POCI):

POCI assets are financial assets that are credit impaired on initial recognition. POCI assets are recorded at fair value at original recognition and profit / rental is subsequently recognised based on a credit-adjusted EIR. ECLs are only recognised or released to the extent that there is a subsequent change in the expected credit losses.

# Undrawn financing commitments:

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected shortfalls in cash flows if the financings is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

For revolving facilities that include both a financings and an undrawn commitment, ECLs are calculated on the undrawn portion of the facility and presented within other liabilities.

# Guarantee and letters of credit contracts:

The Bank estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs is recognised within other liabilities.

# The calculation of ECLs

The Bank calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash shortfalls, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive.

The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

# PD

The Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the past 7 years. PDs for non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.

# EAD

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued profit from missed payments. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has the legal right to call it earlier. The Bank’s product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail facilities, in which the Bank has the right to cancel and/or reduce the facilities with one day notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Bank does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the Bank’s expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the Bank’s future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

# LGD

The Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD.

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective profit rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective profit rate (at reporting date), the Bank uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date). Effective profit rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three scenarios (a base case, an upside, a downside). Each of these is associated with different PDs. When relevant, the assessment of multiple scenarios also incorporates how defaulted financing are expected to be recovered, including the probability that the loans will cure and the value of collateral or the amount that might be received for selling the asset.

The Bank considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics:

- History of legal certainty and enforceability
- History of enforceability and recovery.

The Bank's management has only considered cash, liquid Securities, gold, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals in the LGD calculation. All of these collaterals have a 0% haircut other than equity securities where haircut of 15% is applied.

The credit exposure (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

# FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

The SBP has issued FAQs in its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 with regard to certain interpretation of the SBP application instructions. In respect of Stage 3 provision, the SBP has clarified that the banks, while assessing the higher of IFRS 9 ECL and provision under the SBP Prudential Regulations, shall take into account the ECL against corporate / commercial / SME loan portfolios at the borrower / facility level, and for the retail borrowers at segment / product basis.

# Forward looking information

In its ECL models, the Bank relies on a range of forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

- GDP growth
- Volume of exports of goods
- Consumer price index
- Unemployment rate

# Definition of default

The Bank defines a financial instrument as in default, which is fully aligned with the definition of credit impaired, when it meets one or more of the following criteria:

The customer is more than 90 days past due on its contractual payments, except in case of agriculture, project infrastructure and housing financing. This implies that if one facility of a counterparty is defaulted as per the definition; all other facilities would deem to be classified as stage 3.

Further the following qualitative criteria has been determined for assessment of default:

- The Bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realising security (if held).
- The Bank makes a charge-off or account-specific provision resulting from a perceived decline in credit quality subsequent to the Bank taking on the exposure.
- The Bank consents to a distressed restructuring of the credit obligation where this is likely to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by the material forgiveness, or postponement, of principal, profit or (where relevant) fees.
- The obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection where this would avoid or delay repayment of the credit obligation to the industry group.

# Write-offs

The Bank’s accounting policy under IFRS 9 remains the same as it was under SBP regulations / existing reporting framework.

# 23.3 Other contingent liabilities

The Income Tax Department amended the deemed assessment orders of the Bank for prior years including the tax year 2023. The additions / disallowances were mainly due to allocation of expenses relating to dividends and capital gain, allowability of provision against Islamic financing and related assets, provision against investments and provision against other assets. In the amended order for tax year 2015, additional issues with respect to the taxability of gain on bargain purchase, non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East – Pakistan Branches and the levy of super tax were also raised. The matter has been decided in Bank's favour by Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue. Both the Bank and the tax department filed a reference with the High Court of Sindh in respect of the aforementioned matters.

The management of the Bank, in consultation with its tax advisors, is confident that the decision in respect of the above matters would be in Bank’s favour and accordingly no provision has been made in these unconsolidated financial statements with respect thereto. The additional tax liability in respect of gain on bargain purchase and non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East – Pakistan Branches is Rs 1,096 million and Rs 706 million respectively.

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as amortised cost / held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted debt securities classified as amortised cost / held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiary, is determined on the basis of valuation methodologies which are best reflective of their business model in accordance with the SBP application instructions. The fair value of unquoted debt securities that are not available, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and due to financial institutions cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a.

current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 36.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured as at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised.

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfactions of claims are carried at revalued amounts (level 3 measurement) determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values. The valuation has been determined through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange. The fair value of GoP Ijarah sukuks listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange has been determined through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange. The fair value of other GoP Ijarah sukuks quoted are derived using PKISRV rates. The PKISRV rates are announced by FMA (Financial Market Association) through Reuters. The rates announced are simple average of quotes received from eight different pre-defined / approved dealers / brokers. These are measured at fair value using the rates published by the valuation expert portal (Bloomberg). The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mid rates announced by SBP.

Non-banking assets acquired NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023. The valuation has been determined based on net asset values (NAV) declared by respective funds.

Unquoted Equity Securities The value of unquoted equity securities are determined by using different methods for different securities. Fair value of investment in one of the unquoted investee has been determined by Dividend Discount Model (DDM) by using constant dividends streams of the entity by using various key assumptions considering economic and market conditions. Key assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate (if applicable).

Corporate sukuks The valuation has been determined through closing rates announced by FMA (Financial Market Association) through Reuters. The Bank's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period / year.

The valuation of non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims, mentioned above, is conducted by the valuation expert appointed by the Bank which is also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation expert uses a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank's non-banking asset acquired in satisfaction of claims. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. This value is adjusted to reflect the current condition of the property. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuation cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements. The sensitivity analysis of the fair value measurement of unquoted equity securities due to changes in observable inputs has not been disclosed as the amount is not material and significant.
