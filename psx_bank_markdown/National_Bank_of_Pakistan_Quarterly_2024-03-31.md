# 3.1 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

Effective January 1, 2024, the Bank has adopted International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9, “Financial Instruments” (IFRS 9 / the Standard). As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Bank has elected not to restate comparative figures. Adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities as at the date of transition (i.e. January 1, 2024), were recognised in the unappropriated profit and loss as of the transition date. The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in the Bank's accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 has also significantly impacted disclosures related to the unconsolidated financial instruments. The Bank performed a detailed analysis of its business models for managing financial assets and analysis of their contractual cash flows characteristics.

The following table reconciles the aggregate opening loan loss provision allowances under SBP Prudential Regulations to the ECL allowances under IFRS 9.

|Provision|2024|as per current|Remeasurement|Reclassification|ECLs under IFRS 9|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Impairment allowance against:| | | | | |
|Cash and Balances with Treasury Banks|-|-|-|-|-|
|Balance with Other Banks|117,033|117|-|117,150| |

|Investments|23,608,927|1,040,941|(13,672,429)|10,977,439| |
|Markup Receivable|-|1,376,467|-|1,376,467| |

|Total|258,136,477|21,982,101|(13,672,429)|266,446,149| |

The following table reconciles the carrying amounts of financial assets, from their previous measurement category in accordance with previous local regulations to their new measurement categories upon transition to IFRS 9 on January 01, 2024.

# (a) Changes to Classification and measurement

The SBP's measurement categories of financial assets (Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), available for sale (AFS), held-to-maturity and amortised cost) have been replaced by:

- Debt instruments at amortised cost
- Debt instruments at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), with gains or losses recycled to profit & loss on derecognition.
- Equity instruments at FVOCI, with no recycling of gains or losses of profit & loss on derecognition
- Financial assets Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)

The accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as it was previously in place. Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities can be measured at FVTPL when they meet the definition of held for trading or when they are designated as such on initial recognition using the fair value option. Currently, the Bank does not have any financial liability which is being measured at FVPL.

Under IFRS 9, the classification of the financial assets is based on two criteria: the Bank’s business model for managing the assets; and whether the instruments’ contractual cash flows represent ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on the principal amount outstanding (the ‘SPPI criterion’).

The assessment of the Bank’s business models was made as of the date of initial application, 1 January 2024, and then applied retrospectively to those financial assets that were not derecognised before 31 March 2024. The assessment of whether contractual cash flows on debt instruments are solely comprised of principal and interest was made based on the facts and circumstances as at the initial recognition of the assets.

# 3.1.1 Financial assets and liabilities

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Bank becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Bank commits to purchase or sell the asset.

At initial recognition, the Bank measures a financial asset or financial liability at its fair value including transaction costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability, such as fees and commissions. However, in case of financial asset or liability measured through profit or loss, any transaction costs are expensed in the unconsolidated profit and loss account. Immediately after initial recognition, an expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets measured at amortised cost and investments in debt instruments measured at FVOCI.

# 3.1.2 Financial assets

# 3.1.2.1 Classification and subsequent measurement

The Bank classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

- Fair value through profit or loss (FVPL);
- Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI); or
- Amortised cost.

The classification requirements for debt and equity instruments are described below:

# Debt instruments

Debt instruments are those instruments that meet the definition of a financial liability from the issuer's perspective, such as loans, government and corporate bonds and trade receivables purchased from clients in factoring arrangements without recourse.

Classification and subsequent measurement of debt instruments depend on:

1. the Bank's business model for managing the asset; and
2. the cash flows characteristics of the assets / SPPI test.

Based on these factors, the Bank classifies its debt instruments into one of the following three measurement categories:

- Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest ('SPPI'), and that are not designated at FVPL, are measured at amortised cost. The carrying amount of these assets is adjusted by any expected credit loss allowance recognised. Interest earned from these financial assets is included in 'interest earned’ using the effective interest rate method.
- Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, and that are not designated at FVPL, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Movements in the carrying amount are taken through other comprehensive income, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses on the instrument's amortised cost which are recognised in the unconsolidated profit and loss account. When the financial asset is derecognised, the 'cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in gain on sale of securities'. Interest earned from these financial assets is included in interest earned using the effective interest rate method.
- Fair value through profit or loss (FVPL): Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in the profit or loss and presented in the unconsolidated profit and loss account within unrealised gain / loss on securities in the period in which it arises. Interest earned from these financial assets is included in interest earned on investments using the effective interest rate method.

# Business model:

The business model reflects how the Bank manages the assets in order to generate cash flows. That is, whether the Bank's objective is solely to collect the contractual cash flows from the assets or is to collect both the contractual cash flows and cash flows arising from the sale of assets. If neither of these is applicable (e.g. financial assets are held for trading purposes), then the financial assets are classified as part of 'other' business model and measured at FVPL.

The Bank's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- the objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Bank's key management personnel;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank’s assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.
- Securities held for trading are held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term or are part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. These securities are classified in the 'other' business model and measured at FVPL.

# Cash flows characteristics assessment – Solely Payment of Principal and interest test:

Where the business model is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows or to collect contractual cash flows and sell, the Bank assesses whether the financial instruments' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. In making this assessment, the Bank considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic financing arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic due from counterparty risks and an interest margin that is consistent with a basic due from counterparty arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with a basic due from counterparty arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.

The Bank reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes. The reclassification takes place from the start of the first reporting period following the change.

# Equity instruments

Equity instruments are instruments that meet the definition of equity from the issuer's perspective; that is, instruments that do not contain a contractual obligation to pay and that evidence a residual share in the issuer's net assets.

The Bank measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, except where the Bank's management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Bank's policy is to designate equity investments as FVOCI when those investments are held for purposes other than for trading. When this election is used, fair value gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to the unconsolidated profit and loss account, including on disposal. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return on such investments, continue to be recognised in the unconsolidated profit and loss account as income when the Bank's right to receive payments is established.

IFRS 9 has eliminated impairment assessment requirements for investments in equity instruments. However, in case of unquoted securities where the breakup value of such securities is less than the cost, the difference of the cost and the breakup value has been classified as loss and provided for by charging it to the unconsolidated profit and loss account.

Gains and losses on equity instruments at FVPL are included in the ‘Gain on sales of securities’ line in the unconsolidated profit and loss account.

# 3.1.2.2 Impairment

The Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with its debt instrument assets carried at amortised cost and FVOCI and with the exposure arising from loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The Bank recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- The time value of money; and
- Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

# 3.1.3 Financial liabilities

# 3.1.4 Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments

Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Such financial guarantees are given to banks, financial institutions and others on behalf of customers to secure loans, overdrafts and other banking facilities.

Financial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of:

- The amount of the loss allowance;
- The premium received on initial recognition less income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.

Loan commitments provided by the Bank are measured as the amount of the loss allowance. For financing commitments and financial guarantee contracts, the loss allowance is recognised as a provision. However, for contracts that include both a financing and an undrawn commitment and the Bank cannot separately identify the expected credit losses on the undrawn commitment component from those on the financing component, the expected credit losses on the undrawn commitment are recognised together with the loss allowance for the financing. To the extent that the combined expected credit losses exceed the gross carrying amount of the financing, the expected credit losses are recognised as a provision.

# 3.1.5 Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance

The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour (e.g. the likelihood of customers defaulting and the resulting losses). The Bank has followed the following steps in determining expected credit loss allowance:

1. Portfolio Segmentation and Staging (SICR)
2. Determination of Segment wise Probability of Default (PDs)
3. Estimation of Loss Given Default (LGD)
4. Determination of Exposure at Default (EAD)
5. ECL Scenarios

# 3.1.6 Expected credit loss measurement

IFRS 9 outlines a 'three-stage' model for impairment based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition as summarized below:

- A financial instrument that is not credit-impaired on initial recognition is classified in 'Stage 1' and has its credit risk continuously monitored by the Bank.
- If a significant increase in credit risk ('SICR') since initial recognition is identified, the financial instrument is moved to 'Stage 2' but is not yet deemed to be credit-impaired.
- If the financial instrument is credit-impaired, the financial instrument is then moved to 'Stage 3'.
- Financial instruments in Stage 1 have their ECL measured for 12 months. Instruments in Stages 2 or 3 have their ECL measured based on expected credit losses on a lifetime basis.

# 3.1.7 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

One of the key components of IFRS 9 is to determine whether there has been a SICR in the Bank’s credit exposures since initial recognition. Under IFRS 9, exposures are required to be categorized into three stages:

- Stage 1 – which include performing exposures;
- Stage 2 – which include performing exposures where credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition; and
- Stage 3 – which include credit-impaired exposures.

Under IFRS 9, bank considers the following indicators for assessing SICR:

- forward-looking macroeconomic factors;
- use of lifetime probability of default as opposed to a 12-month measure;
- consider all reasonable and supportable information available at the time of calculation.

# 3.2 Overview of the ECL principles

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12m ECL) as outlined below.

The 12m ECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12m ECLs are calculated on either an individual basis or a collective basis, depending on the nature of the underlying portfolio of financial instruments.

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject borrower. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. However, for certain portfolios, the Bank has rebutted 30 DPD presumption based on behavioral analysis of its borrowers.

When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Bank applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3 and POCI, as described below:

# Stage 1:

When loans are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12m ECLs. Stage 1 loans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12m ECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12m ECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

# Stage 2:

When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs and LGDs are estimated over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

# Stage 3:

For loans considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises the lifetime expected credit losses for these loans. The Bank uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP under the prudential regulations which ever is higher.

# Loan commitments and letters of credit:

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn loan commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected shortfalls in cash flows if the loan is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted at an approximation to the expected EIR on the loan. For loan commitments and letters of credit, the ECL is recognised within Provisions.

# Financial guarantee contracts:

The Bank estimates ECLs based on the present value of the expected payments to reimburse the holder for a credit loss that it incurs. The shortfalls are discounted by the risk-adjusted interest rate relevant to the exposure. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to financial guarantee contracts are recognised within Provisions.

# The calculation of ECLs

The Bank calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash shortfalls, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive.

The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:

|PD|The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the last 7 years. PDs for Non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.|
|---|---|
|EAD|The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has the legal right to call it earlier.|
|LGD|The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD.|

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three scenarios (a base case, an upside, a downside). Each of these is associated with different PDs.

# 10.5.3

General provision includes provision amounting to Rs.181 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 270 million) pertaining to overseas advances to meet the requirements of regulatory authorities of the respective countries in which the Bank operates where IFRS 9 has not been implemented.

# 10.5.4

The SBP has allowed specific relaxation to the Bank for non-classification of overdue loans of certain Public Sector Entities (PSEs) which are guaranteed by Government of Pakistan as non-performing loans up till December 31, 2023. No provision is required against these loans; however, mark-up is being suspended as required by the Prudential Regulations.

# 10.5.5

These represent non-performing advances for agriculture finance which have been classified as loss and fully provided for more than 3 years. These non-performing advances have been charged off by extinguishing them against the provision held in accordance with Prudential Regulations for Agriculture Financing issued by the SBP. This charge off does not, in any way, prejudice the Bank's right of recovery from these customers.

# 22.3.3.1 Pensionary benefits to retired employees

The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan (in Review Jurisdiction) has, by its order dated 27th March 2024, dismissed all the civil review petitions filed by NBP (CRPs No 368 to 409 etc.), as a result of which the Supreme Court decision dated 25th September 2017, in respect of the pension litigation, has now attained finality. Accordingly, the Bank is now required to implement the direction contained in the judgment dated January 15, 2016 of the Lahore High Court, which direction has been upheld by the apex court.

Prior to the announcement of above judgement, the bank had estimated pension related liability amounted to Rs 98.7 billion approximately. Owing to the complexities involved, the management of the bank in consultation with professional actuary and Bank’s legal counsel is working out implementation of the judgement. Pending such an exercise the financial impact of the obligation cannot be ascertained with sufficient reliability as per the requirements of IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”.

# 22.3.4  Compliance and risk matters relating to anti-money laundering at the New York Branch

With close oversight from the Board of Directors and Head Office Senior Management, the New York Branch completed remedial actions pursuant to the public enforcement actions issued by the New York State Department of Financial Services and the Federal Reserve Bank. Head Office and the Board will continue to maintain close oversight of the Branch, despite having made significant progress in meeting regulatory requirements. The actions implemented by the Branch and their associated validation by Internal Audit continue to remain subject to review by its regulators.

| |The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted instruments classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.| | | | |
| |The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.| | | | |


# 34.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorized:

# 38.9 Pool Management

NBP-AIBG has managed following pools for profit and loss distribution.

# a) General depositor pool

The General pool consists of all other remunerative deposits. NBP Aitemaad (the Mudarib) accept deposits on the basis of Mudaraba from depositors (Rabbulmaal). The net return on the pool is arrived at after deduction of direct costs from the gross return earned on the pool. The entire net return after paying equity share to Mudarib is considered as distributable profit of the pool.

# b) Special depositor pools

Special pool(s) are created where the customers desire to invest in high yield assets. These pool(s) rates are higher than the general pool depending on the assets. In case of loss in special pool, the loss will be borne by the special pool members. The net return on the pool is arrived at after deduction of direct costs from the gross return earned on the pool. From the net return, and after allocation of share of profit to commingled equity, profit is paid to the Mudarib in the ratio of the Mudarib’s equity in the pool to the total pool. The balance represents the distributable profit.

# c) Equity pool

Equity pools include AIBG's fund and current account deposits. The equity pool may have constructive liquidation every month and risk associated with assets of pool includes operational, market, equity, return and Shariah.

# Key features and risk & reward characteristics

Deposits are accepted from customers on the basis of Qard (current accounts) and Mudarabah (Saving and term deposits). No profit or loss is passed on to current account depositors.

For deposits accepted on Mudarabah basis from depositors (Rab ul Maal) the Bank acts as Manager (Mudarib) and invests the funds in the Shariah Compliant modes of financings. Rab ul Maal share is distributed among depositors according to weightages declared for a month before start of the period.

In case of loss in a pool during the profit calculation period, the loss is distributed among the depositors (remunerative) according to their ratio of investment.

For all pools, the Mudarib’s share is deducted from the distributable profit to calculate the profit to be allocated to depositors. The allocation of the profit to various deposit categories is determined by the amount invested in that category relative to the total pool, as well as by the weightage assigned to the various deposit categories.

The assets, liabilities, equities, income and expenses are segregated for each of the pool. No pool investment is intermingled with each other. The risk associated with each pool is thus equally distributed among the pools.

The material accounting policies adopted for presentation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for:

# 3.1 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

Effective January 1, 2024, the Bank has adopted International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9, “Financial Instruments” (IFRS 9 / the Standard). As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Bank has elected not to restate comparative figures. Adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities as at the date of transition (i.e. January 1, 2024), were recognised in the unappropriated profit and loss as of the transition date. The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in the Bank's accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 has also significantly impacted disclosures related to the consolidated financial instruments. The Bank performed a detailed analysis of its business models for managing financial assets and analysis of their contractual cash flows characteristics.

The following table reconciles the aggregate opening loan loss provision allowances under SBP Prudential Regulations to the ECL allowances under IFRS 9.

# (a) Changes to Classification and measurement

The SBP's measurement categories of financial assets (Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), available for sale (AFS), held-to-maturity and amortised cost) have been replaced by:

- Debt instruments at amortised cost
- Debt instruments at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), with gains or losses recycled to profit & loss on derecognition.
- Equity instruments at FVOCI, with no recycling of gains or losses of profit & loss on derecognition
- Financial assets Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)

The accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as it was previously in place. Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities can be measured at FVTPL when they meet the definition of held for trading or when they are designated as such on initial recognition using the fair value option. Currently, the Bank does not have any financial liability which is being measured at FVPL.

Under IFRS 9, the classification of the financial assets is based on two criteria: the Bank’s business model for managing the assets; and whether the instruments’ contractual cash flows represent ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on the principal amount outstanding (the ‘SPPI criterion’).

The assessment of the Bank’s business models was made as of the date of initial application, 1 January 2024, and then applied retrospectively to those financial assets that were not derecognised before 31 March 2024. The assessment of whether contractual cash flows on debt instruments are solely comprised of principal and interest was made based on the facts and circumstances as at the initial recognition of the assets.

# 3.1.1 Financial assets and liabilities

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Bank becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Bank commits to purchase or sell the asset.

At initial recognition, the Bank measures a financial asset or financial liability at its fair value including transaction costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability, such as fees and commissions. However, in case of financial asset or liability measured through profit or loss, any transaction costs are expensed in the consolidated profit and loss account. Immediately after initial recognition, an expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets measured at amortised cost and investments in debt instruments measured at FVOCI.

# 3.1.2 Financial assets

# 3.1.2.1 Classification and subsequent measurement

The Bank classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

- Fair value through profit or loss (FVPL);
- Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI); or
- Amortised cost.

The classification requirements for debt and equity instruments are described below:

# Debt instruments

Debt instruments are those instruments that meet the definition of a financial liability from the issuer's perspective, such as loans, government and corporate bonds and trade receivables purchased from clients in factoring arrangements without recourse.

Classification and subsequent measurement of debt instruments depend on:

1. the Bank's business model for managing the asset; and
2. the cash flows characteristics of the assets / SPPI test.

Based on these factors, the Bank classifies its debt instruments into one of the following three measurement categories:

- Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest ('SPPI'), and that are not designated at FVPL, are measured at amortised cost. The carrying amount of these assets is adjusted by any expected credit loss allowance recognised. Interest earned from these financial assets is included in 'interest earned’ using the effective interest rate method.
- Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, and that are not designated at FVPL, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Movements in the carrying amount are taken through other comprehensive income, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses on the instrument's amortised cost which are recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account. When the financial asset is derecognised, the 'cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in gain on sale of securities'. Interest earned from these financial assets is included in interest earned using the effective interest rate method.
- Fair value through profit or loss (FVPL): Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in the profit or loss and presented in the consolidated profit and loss account within unrealised gain / loss on securities in the period in which it arises. Interest earned from these financial assets is included in interest earned on investments using the effective interest rate method.

# Business model:

The business model reflects how the Bank manages the assets in order to generate cash flows. That is, whether the Bank's objective is solely to collect the contractual cash flows from the assets or is to collect both the contractual cash flows and cash flows arising from the sale of assets. If neither of these is applicable (e.g. financial assets are held for trading purposes), then the financial assets are classified as part of 'other' business model and measured at FVPL.

The Bank's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Bank's key management personnel;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank’s assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

Securities held for trading are held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term or are part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. These securities are classified in the 'other' business model and measured at FVPL.

# Cash flows characteristics assessment – Solely Payment of Principal and interest test:

Where the business model is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows or to collect contractual cash flows and sell, the Bank assesses whether the financial instruments' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. In making this assessment, the Bank considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic financing arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic due from counterparty risks and an interest margin that is consistent with a basic due from counterparty arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with a basic due from counterparty arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.

The Bank reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes. The reclassification takes place from the start of the first reporting period following the change.

# Equity instruments

Equity instruments are instruments that meet the definition of equity from the issuer's perspective; that is, instruments that do not contain a contractual obligation to pay and that evidence a residual share in the issuer's net assets.

The Bank measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, except where the Bank's management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Bank's policy is to designate equity investments as FVOCI when those investments are held for purposes other than for trading. When this election is used, fair value gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to the consolidated profit and loss account, including on disposal. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return on such investments, continue to be recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account as income when the Bank's right to receive payments is established.

IFRS 9 has eliminated impairment assessment requirements for investments in equity instruments. However, in case of unquoted securities where the breakup value of such securities is less than the cost, the difference of the cost and the breakup value has been classified as loss and provided for by charging it to the consolidated profit and loss account.

Gains and losses on equity instruments at FVPL are included in the ‘Gain on sales of securities’ line in the consolidated profit and loss account.

# 3.1.2.2 Impairment

The Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with its debt instrument assets carried at amortised cost and FVOCI and with the exposure arising from loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The Bank recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- The time value of money; and
- Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

# 3.1.3 Financial liabilities

# 3.1.4 Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments

Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Such financial guarantees are given to banks, financial institutions and others on behalf of customers to secure loans, overdrafts and other banking facilities.

Financial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of:

- The amount of the loss allowance;
- The premium received on initial recognition less income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.

Loan commitments provided by the Bank are measured as the amount of the loss allowance. For financing commitments and financial guarantee contracts, the loss allowance is recognised as a provision. However, for contracts that include both a financing and an undrawn commitment and the Bank cannot separately identify the expected credit losses on the undrawn commitment component from those on the financing component, the expected credit losses on the undrawn commitment are recognised together with the loss allowance for the financing. To the extent that the combined expected credit losses exceed the gross carrying amount of the financing, the expected credit losses are recognised as a provision.

# 3.1.5 Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance

The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour (e.g. the likelihood of customers defaulting and the resulting losses). The Bank has followed the following steps in determining expected credit loss allowance:

1. Portfolio Segmentation and Staging (SICR)
2. Determination of Segment wise Probability of Default (PDs)
3. Estimation of Loss Given Default (LGD)
4. Determination of Exposure at Default (EAD)
5. ECL Scenarios

# 3.1.6 Expected credit loss measurement

IFRS 9 outlines a 'three-stage' model for impairment based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition as summarized below:

- A financial instrument that is not credit-impaired on initial recognition is classified in 'Stage 1' and has its credit risk continuously monitored by the Bank.
- If a significant increase in credit risk ('SICR') since initial recognition is identified, the financial instrument is moved to 'Stage 2' but is not yet deemed to be credit-impaired.
- If the financial instrument is credit-impaired, the financial instrument is then moved to 'Stage 3'.
- Financial instruments in Stage 1 have their ECL measured for 12 months. Instruments in Stages 2 or 3 have their ECL measured based on expected credit losses on a lifetime basis.

# 3.1.7 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

One of the key components of IFRS 9 is to determine whether there has been a SICR in the Bank’s credit exposures since initial recognition. Under IFRS 9, exposures are required to be categorized into three stages:

- Stage 1 – which include performing exposures;
- Stage 2 – which include performing exposures where credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition; and
- Stage 3 – which include credit-impaired exposures.

Under IFRS 9, bank considers the following indicators for assessing SICR:

- forward-looking macroeconomic factors;
- use of lifetime probability of default as opposed to a 12-month measure;
- consider all reasonable and supportable information available at the time of calculation.

# 3.2 Overview of the ECL principles

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12m ECL) as outlined below.

The 12m ECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12m ECLs are calculated on either an individual basis or a collective basis, depending on the nature of the underlying portfolio of financial instruments.

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject borrower. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. However, for certain portfolios, the Bank has rebutted 30 DPD presumption based on behavioral analysis of its borrowers.

When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Bank applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3 and POCI, as described below:

|Stage 1:|When loans are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12m ECLs. Stage 1 loans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12m ECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12m ECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. This calculation is made for all the scenarios.|
|---|---|
|Stage 2:|When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs and LGDs are estimated over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.|
|Stage 3:|For loans considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises the lifetime expected credit losses for these loans. The Bank uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP under the prudential regulations which ever is higher.|

# Loan commitments and letters of credit

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn loan commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected shortfalls in cash flows if the loan is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted at an approximation to the expected EIR on the loan. For loan commitments and letters of credit, the ECL is recognised within Provisions.

# Financial guarantee contracts

The Bank estimates ECLs based on the present value of the expected payments to reimburse the holder for a credit loss that it incurs. The shortfalls are discounted by the risk-adjusted interest rate relevant to the exposure. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to financial guarantee contracts are recognised within Provisions.

# The calculation of ECLs

The Bank calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash shortfalls, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive.

The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:

|PD|The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the last 7 years. PDs for Non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.|
|---|---|
|EAD|The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has the legal right to call it earlier.|
|LGD|The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD.|

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three scenarios (a base case, an upside, a downside). Each of these is associated with different PDs.

General provision includes provision amounting to Rs.181 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 270 million) pertaining to overseas advances to meet the requirements of regulatory authorities of the respective countries in which the Bank operates where IFRS 9 has not been implemented.

# 10.5.4

The SBP has allowed specific relaxation to the Bank for non-classification of overdue loans of certain Public Sector Entities (PSEs) which are guaranteed by Government of Pakistan as non-performing loans up till December 31, 2023. No provision is required against these loans; however, mark-up is being suspended as required by the Prudential Regulations.

# 10.5.5

These represent non-performing advances for agriculture finance which have been classified as loss and fully provided for more than 3 years. These non-performing advances have been charged off by extinguishing them against the provision held in accordance with Prudential Regulations for Agriculture Financing issued by the SBP. This charge off does not, in any way, prejudice the Bank's right of recovery from these customers.

# 23.3.3.1 Pensionary benefits to retired employees

The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan (in Review Jurisdiction) has, by its order dated 27th March 2024, dismissed all the civil review petitions filed by NBP (CRPs No 368 to 409 etc.), as a result of which the Supreme Court decision dated 25th September 2017, in respect of the pension litigation, has now attained finality. Accordingly, the Bank is now required to implement the direction contained in the judgment dated January 15, 2016 of the Lahore High Court, which direction has been upheld by the apex court.

Prior to the announcement of above judgement, the bank had estimated pension related liability amounted to Rs 98.7 billion approximately. Owing to the complexities involved, the management of the bank in consultation with professional actuary and Bank’s legal counsel is working out implementation of the judgement. Pending such an exercise the financial impact of the obligation cannot be ascertained with sufficient reliability as per the requirements of IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”.

# 23.3.4 Compliance and risk matters relating to anti-money laundering at the New York Branch

With close oversight from the Board of Directors and Head Office Senior Management, the New York Branch completed remedial actions pursuant to the public enforcement actions issued by the New York State Department of Financial Services and the Federal Reserve Bank. Head Office and the Board will continue to maintain close oversight of the Branch, despite having made significant progress in meeting regulatory requirements. The actions implemented by the Branch and their associated validation by Internal Audit continue to remain subject to review by its regulators.

# 35. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted instruments classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# Financial Instruments Analysis

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 39.9 Pool Management

NBP-AIBG has managed following pools for profit and loss distribution.

# a) General depositor pool

The General pool consists of all other remunerative deposits. NBP Aitemaad (the Mudarib) accept deposits on the basis of Mudaraba from depositors (Rabbulmaal). The net return on the pool is arrived at after deduction of direct costs from the gross return earned on the pool. The entire net return after paying equity share to Mudarib is considered as distributable profit of the pool.

# b) Special depositor pools

(Total 52 during the period and 46 as at Mar 31, 2024) Special pool(s) are created where the customers desire to invest in high yield assets. These pool(s) rates are higher than the general pool depending on the assets. In case of loss in special pool, the loss will be borne by the special pool members. The net return on the pool is arrived at after deduction of direct costs from the gross return earned on the pool. From the net return, and after allocation of share of profit to commingled equity, profit is paid to the Mudarib in the ratio of the Mudarib’s equity in the pool to the total pool. The balance represents the distributable profit.

# c) Equity pool

Equity pools include AIBG's fund and current account deposits. The equity pool may have constructive liquidation every month and risk associated with assets of pool includes operational, market, equity, return and Shariah.

# Key features and risk & reward characteristics

Deposits are accepted from customers on the basis of Qard (current accounts) and Mudarabah (Saving and term deposits). No profit or loss is passed on to current account depositors.

For deposits accepted on Mudarabah basis from depositors (Rab ul Maal) the Bank acts as Manager (Mudarib) and invests the funds in the Shariah Compliant modes of financings. Rab ul Maal share is distributed among depositors according to weightages declared for a month before start of the period.

In case of loss in a pool during the profit calculation period, the loss is distributed among the depositors (remunerative) according to their ratio of investment.

For all pools, the Mudarib’s share is deducted from the distributable profit to calculate the profit to be allocated to depositors. The allocation of the profit to various deposit categories is determined by the amount invested in that category relative to the total pool, as well as by the weightage assigned to the various deposit categories.

The assets, liabilities, equities, income and expenses are segregated for each of the pool. No pool investment is intermingled with each other. The risk associated with each pool is thus equally distributed among the pools.
