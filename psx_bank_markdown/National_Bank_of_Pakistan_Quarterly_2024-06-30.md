# Directors’ Report to the Shareholders

# Standalone Financial Statements

Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors "the Board", we have the pleasure of presenting, the condensed interim standalone financial statements of the Bank for the half-year ended June 30, 2024. These financial statements have been reviewed by the Bank's external auditors.

# Economic Environment

After enduring consecutive negative shocks, the global economy is now showing signs of stabilization. Despite flaring geopolitical tensions and high interest rates, global growth is projected to stabilize at 2.6 percent this year. It is then expected to edge up to 2.7 percent in 2025-26 amid modest growth in trade and investment.

During the fiscal year 2024, Pakistan's GDP growth reached 2.4%, indicating an improvement over the challenges faced in the previous year. Notably, Pakistan’s headline inflation clocked in at 12.6% on a year-on-year basis in Jun‘24 and remains well below the levels of the same month last year. Pakistan's total liquid foreign exchange reserves grew to USD 13.9 billion by Jun’24 from around USD 9.2 billion in Jun’23, comprising USD 9.4 billion held by the State Bank of Pakistan and USD 4.6 billion by commercial banks. The fiscal deficit was 6.8% percent of GDP, unchanged from the same period last year, revenue collection surged by an impressive 38%, attributed to a remarkable 75% increase in non-tax collection and a substantial 29% rise in tax revenues. The State Bank of Pakistan chose the path of monetary easing and reduced the policy rate by 150 base points, from a steady 22% in Mar'24 and further down to 19.5% in Jul'24 due to improved inflation outlook, stable PKR against USD along with conclusion of negotiation with IMF.

The Pakistan Stock Exchange continues its exceptional run in 2024, with the KSE-100 Index surging to 78,000+ points from 62,451 points at the end of 2023. This positioned it as the top-performing asset class in the country delivering an impressive return. Looking ahead, the country’s economic outlook is stable, with anticipated political stability, IMF deal in line, anticipated foreign exchange inflows and improved economic outlook.

Banking industry outlook is promising and is expected to benefit from stronger economic growth and a rebound in credit demand, driven by IMF support and a reduced policy rate in the second half of 2024. With a more optimistic outlook for GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates, loan growth is expected to accelerate. Credit to the private sector is expected to gradually recover, largely driven by increased demand in key industries such as wholesale and retail trade. Despite some credit cost pressures on account of implementation of IFRS-9, overall credit quality remains satisfactory, and the anticipated easing of monetary policy in 2024 should help reduce the risk of increase in non-performing loans.

# Financial Performance - H1'2024

Amidst the challenges of the prevailing business environment, your Bank has delivered strong financial results for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024, except for the one-off extra-ordinary item being the impact of the decision in pensions review petition. These results demonstrate the resilience inherent in the Bank's business model, effectiveness of the strategic efforts by management, and the commitment demonstrated by our field personnel in these demanding circumstances.

# Summary

# Mark-up/Interest Income

For the half-year period under review, your Bank earned Gross Interest Income 'GII' of PKR 562.6 Bn as against PKR 432.3 Bn for the corresponding half-year period of 2023. The PKR 130.3 Bn increase in GII was achieved through a volumetric growth in average interests bearing assets coupled with the favourable impact of higher average policy rate during H1'24. During this period, the Bank's investments averaged PKR 4,258 Bn (H1'23: PKR 3,623 Bn) and generated a mark-up/interest income of PKR 433.8 Bn being PKR 106.8 Bn or 32.66% up against PKR 327.0 Bn for H1'23. This translates into average yield at 20.5% (H1'23: 18.2%). In the higher policy rate environment, maturity profile of the Bank's investment book is skewed as a strategy towards shorter duration securities. Similarly, placements averaged PKR 77.7 Bn (H1'23:PKR 82.6 Bn) and generated a mark-up income of PKR 6.9 Bn (H1'23: PKR 7.2 Bn) at an improved yield of 17.98% as compared to 17.65% for H1'23.

The Bank's loan book averaged PKR 1518.0 Bn and generated a mark-up income of PKR 121.9 Bn i.e., PKR 23.8 Bn or 24.3% higher than PKR 98.1 Bn of H1'23. This too was achieved through both, a volumetric growth by PKR 80.1 Bn, as well as the favourable rate variance with particular growth observed in SME/Commercial and retail loan portfolios. Pertinent to mention, this growth in income was achieved despite the Bank carrying a higher proportion of lower-margin and non-performing loans extended to certain state-owned entities.

Likewise, the Bank's cost of funds for H1'24 also closed higher at PKR 490.8 Bn as compared to PKR 359.2 Bn in H1'23. This increase of PKR 131.6 Bn or 36.7% was mainly driven by an increase in cost of deposits by PKR 76.8 Bn and the borrowings/repo/Swap cost by PKR 54.7 Bn. While average cost of deposits stood higher from 11.19% in H1’23 to 14.04% in H1’24, total cost of funds increased from 14.8% to 17.7%. Consequently, the Net Interest Income 'NII' for the period under review closed at PKR 71.8 Bn, depicting a decline by 1.9% against PKR 73.1 Bn of H1'23.

# Non-Fund Income

Non-Fund Income 'NFI' for the H1'24 recorded a YoY increase to close at PKR 25.1 Bn which is PKR 6.0 Bn or 31.7% higher than PKR 19.0 Bn of H1'23. While fee & commission income recorded a YoY increase of 14.7% to close at PKR 12.1 Bn (H1'23: PKR 10.5 Bn), the dividend income increased by PKR 0.7 Bn or 28.0% to close at PKR 3.0 Bn. On the other hand, while FX income decreased by 1.7% to close at PKR 4.0 Bn as against PKR 4.1 Bn for H1'23, capital gains recorded an increase by PKR 4.9 Bn or 532.2% to close at PKR 5.8 Bn (H1'23: PKR 0.9 Bn). Going forward, the NFI is expected to remain strong following the recent developments such as high forex reserves, strong stock market indicators and improvement in the overall economic environment.

# Operating Expenses

Amidst the high inflationary pressures, total operating expenses of the Bank for the half-year period under review amounted to PKR 49.1 Bn which is 11.3% higher YoY as compared to PKR 44.1 Bn for the similar period last year. HR cost that constitutes around 64.8% of the total operating expenses, amounted to PKR 31.8 Bn depicting a YoY increase of PKR 3.6 Bn or 12.7%. While property related expenses amounted to PKR 6.1 Bn (H1'23: PKR 5.12 Bn), IT related expenses amounted to PKR 3.8 Bn (H1 '23: PKR 3.5 Bn) as the Bank is diligently upgrading its IT infrastructure through core banking system and major software maintenance. Accordingly, the Bank’s cost-to-income ratio (excluding extraordinary item) for the period stood at 50.7% as against 47.8% for the similar period last year.

# Credit Loss Allowances

The Bank prudently identifies credit loss allowances in its asset portfolio under the expected credit loss model and maintains a robust level of provisions as per the applicable regulatory requirements. During H1'24, the Bank’s non-performing loans decreased by 1.1% to reach PKR 218.5 Bn from PKR 220.8 Bn as of Dec 31, 2023. These translate into loan infection ratio at 14.2% (Dec’23: 13.5%). Gross NPL ratio stands high as the Bank carries a significant amount of legacy NPLs.

For the six-months period under review, reversal amounted to PKR 1.8 Bn was recorded as compared to a total charge of PKR 0.41 Bn for the corresponding six months period of 2023. Key contributor towards this drop were the diminution in value of investments recorded a YoY decrease of PKR 1,512 Mn and recorded reversal amounted to PKR 257.7 Mn as against PKR 1,254.3 Mn charge in the comparative period. Whereas, credit loss allowance against loans & advances recorded a net reversal of PKR 1,819.4 Mn as against a reversal of PKR 946.9 Mn for the corresponding 6 month period of 2023.

# Profit after tax and Appropriations

Taxation charge for the period amounted to PKR 263.7 million. Consequently, profit after-tax for the half-year period ended June 30, 2024 stood at PKR 251.1 million. This translates into earnings per share of Rs. 0.12 as compared to earnings per share of Rs. 12.23 for H1'23. The standalone after-tax profit of the Bank for the half-year ended June 30, 2024 along with the brought forward unappropriated profit is proposed for appropriation as follows:

|Profit available for appropriation| |201,713.4|
|Appropriation:| | |

Net advances stood at PKR 1,282.6 Bn i.e., 8.3% lower than PKR 1,398.1 Bn level at the end of 2023. While growth was achieved in Islamic banking loans, there was some drop in corporate and commercial segments, which is expected to rebound in the easing monetary policy environment.

# Investments

Pursuant to an effective risk/liquidity management strategy, the Bank is maintaining a well-diversified portfolio of investment across zero risk weighted instruments, high dividend yielding equities and other interest-bearing financial instruments. As at June 30, 2024, the Bank's investments (at cost) amounted to PKR 4,699.9 Bn (2023:PKR 4,393.9 Bn) with a carrying value of PKR 4,728.3 Bn (2023:PKR 4,403.4 Bn). During the half-year period under review, PKR 306.0 Bn or 7.0% growth in the investments (at cost).

# HALF YEARLY REPORT JUNE 2024

Core customer sticky deposits that contribute PKR 3,576.6 Bn or 87.2% of the Bank's total deposits. With total current account deposits at PKR 2,301.2 Bn or 56.1% of the total deposits at June 30, 2024, the Bank maintains a strong liquidity and funding profile. The Bank's CASA ratio stood high at 80.1%. Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio stood at 197% (Dec'23:176%) and 174% (Dec'23:159%), respectively vis-à-vis regulatory requirement of 100% for each.

# Capital Strength and Adequacy

The Bank has been designated as a Domestic Systemically Important Bank "D-SIB" by the SBP. Accordingly, the Bank seeks to maintain strong levels of capitalization to build resilience and maintain adequate buffers over regulatory requirements. The Bank's Eligible Tier-1 capital stood at PKR 274.6 Bn at the end of June, 2024, depicting a 3.1% drop from PKR 283.3 Bn at YE'23. Whereas, the eligible Tier-2 capital stood at PKR 89.9 Bn as against PKR 93.4 Bn at YE’23. This drop in capital is mainly triggered by the adjustment in the opening equity due to incremental provisioning as per IFRS 9. Consequently, the Total Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) stood high at 24.72% with Tier-1 capital adequacy ratio at 18.62% as compared to 25.47% and 19.16%, respectively, at YE'2023. While leverage ratio stood at 3.10%, other financial soundness indicators also depict a strong & resilient position of the Bank.

# Contingency Regarding the Pension Case

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REVIEW REPORT

To the members of National Bank of Pakistan

# Report on review of Interim Financial Statements

# Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position of National Bank of Pakistan (the Bank) as at June 30, 2024 and the related unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of changes in equity, unconsolidated condensed interim cash flow statement, and notes to the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements for the half year then ended (here-in-after referred to as the “interim financial statements”). Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements based on our review.

The figures for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account and unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income have not been subject to review and therefore, we do not express a conclusion thereon.

# Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity". A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

# Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

The engagement partners on the review resulting in this independent auditors’ review report are Shahbaz Akbar (A. F. Ferguson & Co.) and Zulfikar Ali Causer (BDO Ebrahim & Co.).

To determine appropriate classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments, to be assessed based on combination of the entity's business model for managing the assets and the instruments' contractual cash flow characteristics. The adoption of IFRS 9 has also fundamentally changed the impairment method of financial assets with a forward-looking Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach.

'The SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 has made certain amendments and extended the timelines of SBP's IFRS 9 Application Instructions to address most of the matters raised by the banks with a direction to ensure compliance by the extended timeline. There are a few matters which include maintenance of general provision, income recognition on islamic financings and fair valuation of subsidized loans, the treatments of which are still under deliberation with the SBP. The Bank has continued to follow the treatment adopted in respect of these matters in the prior periods till the time SBP issues the relevant guidance / clarification.

The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in the Bank's accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 has also significantly impacted disclosures related to the unconsolidated financial instruments. The Bank performed a detailed analysis of its business models for managing financial assets and analysis of their contractual cash flows characteristics.

# Financial liabilities

Under IFRS 9, the accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus financial liabilities are being carried at Amortized cost except for derivatives which are being measured at FVTPL.

# 3.2.2 Business model:

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Bank's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Bank's key management personnel;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank’s assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:

1. Hold to Collect (HTC) business model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash
2. Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S) business model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
3. Other business models: Resulting in classification of financial assets as FVTPL

# 3.2.3 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest / profit (SPPI)

As a second step of its classification process, the Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. ‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium / discount). The most significant elements of interest / profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as, but not limited to, the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest / profit rate is set. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL.

# 3.2.4 Application to the Bank's financial assets

Debt based financial assets

Debt based financial assets held by the Bank include: advances, lending to financial institutions, investment in federal government securities, corporate bonds and other private sukuks, cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks, and other financial assets.

a) These are measured at Amortized cost if they meet both of the following conditions and 'are not designated as FVTPL:

- the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows;
- and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

HALF YEARLY REPORT JUNE 2024

The Bank’s business model for these financial assets can still be HTC even when sales of these financial assets occur. However, if more than an infrequent number of sales of significant value are made, the Bank assesses whether and how the sales are consistent with the HTC objective.

b) Debt based financial assets are measured at FVOCI only if these meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as FVTPL:

- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

c) Debt based financial assets if these are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at Amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

# Equity instruments

Equity instruments are instruments that meet the definition of equity from the issuer's perspective; that is, instruments that do not contain a contractual obligation to pay and that evidence a residual share in the issuer's net assets. The Bank measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, except where the Bank's management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Bank's policy is to designate equity investments as FVOCI when those investments are held for purposes other than for trading. When this election is used, fair value gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to the profit and loss account, including on disposal. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return on such investments, continue to be recognised in the profit and loss account as income when the Bank's right to receive payments is established.

IFRS 9 has removed the requirement for impairment assessments on equity investments. However, under BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024, dated July 29, 2024, Banks may continue to measure unquoted equity securities at the lower of cost or break-up value until December 31, 2024. Starting January 1, 2025, Banks will be required to measure unquoted equity securities at fair value, as mandated by the IFRS 9 application guidelines. For unquoted securities where the break-up value is lower than the cost, the difference has been classified as a loss and charged to the profit and loss account. Gains and losses on equity instruments at FVTPL are included in the ‘Gain on sales of securities’ line in the profit and loss account.

# 3.2.5 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Bank purchases or sells the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like advances, lending to financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account or financial institutions. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased.

a) Amortized cost (AC) Financial assets and financial liabilities under Amortized cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These are subsequently measured at Amortized cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest income / profit / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account.

b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for debt based financial assets in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of debt based financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is transferred from surplus / deficit to unappropriated profit.

28 NATIONAL BANK OF PAKISTAN

# c) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost will be directly recorded in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

# 3.2.6 Derecognition

# Financial assets

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

# Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account.

# 3.3 Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with all advances and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Bank recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money; and
- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject customer. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer / facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 60 days past due. When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Bank applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

HALF YEARLY REPORT JUNE 2024

# Based on the above process, the Bank groups its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3, as described below:

# Stage 1:

When financial instruments are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

# Stage 2:

When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

# Stage 3:

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises the LTECLs for these instruments. The Bank uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP.

# Undrawn financing commitments:

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the financings is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. For revolving facilities that include both a financings and an undrawn commitment, ECLs are calculated on un-drawn portion of the facility and presented within other liabilities.

# Guarantee and letters of credit contracts:

The Bank estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven and internally developed credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit contracts respectively. The calculation is made using a probability weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within other liabilities.

# The calculation of ECLs

The Bank calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash flows, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:

# PD

The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the last 7 years. PDs for Non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.

# EAD

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest / profit from missed payments. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has a legal right to call it earlier. The Bank's product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail facilities, in which the Bank has the right to cancel and / or reduce the facilities with one day notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Bank does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the Bank expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the Bank future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

# LGD

The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD.

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective interest rate (at reporting date), the Bank uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date).

Effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the Amortized cost of a financial liability.

To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The Bank considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics:

- History of legal certainty and enforceability
- History of enforceability and recovery

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three scenarios (a base case, a best case, a worst case). Each of these is associated with different PDs.

The Bank's management has only considered cash, liquid securities, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals, while calculating EADs.

The credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level for corporate / commercial / SME loan portfolios and at segment / product basis for retail portfolio.

# Forward looking information

In its ECL models, the Bank relies on range of the following forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

- GDP Growth
- Consumer Price Index
- Unemployment rate

# Definition of default

The concept of "impairment or "default" is critical to the implementation of IFRS 9 as it drives determination of risk parameters, i.e. PD, LGD and EAD.

This implies that if one facility of a counterparty becomes 90+ DPD in repaying its contractual dues or as defined in PRs; all other facilities would deem to be classified as stage 3.

# Write-offs

The Bank's accounting policy under IFRS 9 remains the same as it was under SBP regulations / exiting reporting framework.

# 3.4 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held-for-sale

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held-for-sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of derecognition.

Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or Amortized while they are classified as held for sale. Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the statement of financial position. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the statement of financial position.

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The basis for accounting estimates adopted in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements is the same as that applied in the preparation of the unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for IFRS 9 as mentioned above.

# 5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The financial risk management objectives and policies adopted by the Bank are consistent with those as disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 10.5.3 General provision

General provision includes provision amounting to Rs.101 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 270 million) pertaining to overseas advances to meet the requirements of regulatory authorities of the respective countries in which the Bank operates where IFRS 9 has not been implemented.

# 10.5.4 Specific relaxation by SBP

The SBP has allowed specific relaxation to the Bank for non-classification of overdue loans of certain Public Sector Entities (PSEs) which are guaranteed by Government of Pakistan as non-performing loans up till December 31, 2024. No provision is required against these loans; however, mark-up is being suspended as required by the Prudential Regulations. Further SBP has allowed specific relaxation on the requirement for ECL against overdue foreign currency loans of certain Public Sector Entities, either up till December 31, 2024 or permanently.

# 10.5.5 Non-performing advances

These represent non-performing advances for agriculture finance which have been classified as loss and fully provided for more than 3 years. These non-performing advances have been charged off by extinguishing them against the provision held in accordance with Prudential Regulations for Agriculture Financing issued by the SBP. This charge off does not, in any way, prejudice the Bank's right of recovery from these customers.

# 36. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted instruments classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 36.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorized:

- Non-Controlling interest / (minority interest) in equity of the subsidiary companies are measured at fair value for all the subsidiaries acquired from period beginning on or after January 1, 2010 whereas minority interest of previously acquired subsidiaries are measured at the proportionate net assets of subsidiary companies attributable to interest which is not owned by holding company.
- Material intra-group balances and transactions have been eliminated.

# 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

# 2.1 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

# 2.1.1

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

Wherever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017, or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IAS 34 or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

# 2.1.2

The SBP vide BSD Circular letter No.10, dated August 26, 2002 has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard 40, Investment Property for banking companies till further instructions. Moreover, SBP vide BPRD circular No.4, dated February 25, 2015 has deferred the applicability of Islamic Financial Accounting Standards IFAS 3, Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits. Further, according to the notification of the SECP issued vide SRO 411(I) /2008 dated April 28, 2008, International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures has not been made applicable for banks. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 2.1.3

As allowed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022, IFRS 9 has not been adopted for overseas branches where it is not applicable as per their local regulations. In addition to the above, the SBP has recently issued BPRD Circular Letter No.16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024 in which certain relaxations / clarifications have been provided upon adoption of IFRS 9 which are disclosed in note 3.2 to the consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 2.1.4

The SECP vide SRO 56 (1) / 2016 dated January 28, 2016, has notified that the requirements of IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements) and section 228 of the Companies Act, 2017 will not be applicable with respect to the investment in mutual funds established under Trust structure.

# 2.1.5

The disclosures made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on the format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 2, dated February 09, 2023 and IAS 34. These consolidated condensed interim financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the audited annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited annual financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 2.1.6

Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published accounting and reporting standards that are effective in the current period:

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2024 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any material effect on the Bank's operations and are therefore not detailed in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements except for IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments), the impact of which is disclosed under note 3.2.

# 2.1.7

Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective:

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2025 but are considered not to be relevant or will not have any material effect on the Bank's financial statements except for:

- the new standard - IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (IFRS 18) (published in April 2024) with applicability date of January 01, 2027 by IASB. IFRS 18 is yet to be adopted in Pakistan. IFRS 18 when adopted and applicable shall impact the presentation of 'Statement of Profit and Loss Account' with certain additional disclosures in the financial statements.

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The material accounting policies adopted for presentation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for:

# 3.1 Adoption of revised forms for the preparation of the condensed interim financial statement

The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 09, 2023, issued the revised forms for the preparation of the condensed interim quarterly / half yearly financial statements of the Banks / DFIs which are applicable for quarterly / half yearly periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 as per BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023. The implementation of the revised forms has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the consolidated condensed interim financial statements. There is no impact of this change on the consolidated condensed interim financial statements in terms of recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities. The Bank has adopted the above changes in the presentation and made additional disclosures to the extent applicable to its operations and corresponding figures have been rearranged / reclassified to correspond to the current period presentation.

# 3.2 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

The SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 has made certain amendments and extended the timelines of SBP's IFRS 9 Application Instructions to address most of the matters raised by the banks with a direction to ensure compliance by the extended timeline. There are a few matters which include maintenance of general provision, income recognition on islamic financings and fair valuation of subsidized loans, the treatments of which are still under deliberation with the SBP. The Bank has continued to follow the treatment adopted in respect of these matters in the prior periods till the time SBP issues the relevant guidance / clarification. The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in the Bank's accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 has also significantly impacted disclosures related to the consolidated financial instruments. The Bank performed a detailed analysis of its business models for managing financial assets and analysis of their contractual cash flows characteristics.

# 3.2.1 Classification

# Financial assets

Under IFRS 9, existing categories of financial assets: Held for trading (HFT), Available for sale (AFS), Held to maturity (HTM) and loans and receivables have been replaced by:

- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss account (FVTPL)
- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- Financial assets at Amortized cost

# Financial liabilities

Under IFRS 9, the accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus financial liabilities are being carried at Amortized cost except for derivatives which are being measured at FVTPL.

# 3.2.2 Business model:

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Bank's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Bank's key management personnel;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank’s assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:

1. Hold to Collect (HTC) business model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash
2. Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S) business model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
3. Other business models: Resulting in classification of financial assets as FVTPL

# 3.2.3 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest / profit (SPPI)

As a second step of its classification process, the Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. ‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium / discount). The most significant elements of interest / profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as, but not limited to, the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest / profit rate is set. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL.

# 3.2.4 Application to the Bank's financial assets

# Debt based financial assets

Debt based financial assets held by the Bank include: advances, lending to financial institutions, investment in federal government securities, corporate bonds and other private sukuks, cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks, and other financial assets.

a) These are measured at Amortized cost if they meet both of the following conditions and 'are not designated as FVTPL:

- the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows;

and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding. The Bank’s business model for these financial assets can still be HTC even when sales of these financial assets occur. However, if more than an infrequent number of sales of significant value are made, the Bank assesses whether and how the sales are consistent with the HTC objective.

b) Debt based financial assets are measured at FVOCI only if these meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as FVTPL:

- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

c) Debt based financial assets if these are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at Amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

# Equity instruments

Equity instruments are instruments that meet the definition of equity from the issuer's perspective; that is, instruments that do not contain a contractual obligation to pay and that evidence a residual share in the issuer's net assets. The Bank measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, except where the Bank's management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Bank's policy is to designate equity investments as FVOCI when those investments are held for purposes other than for trading. When this election is used, fair value gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to the profit and loss account, including on disposal. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return on such investments, continue to be recognised in the profit and loss account as income when the Bank's right to receive payments is established.

IFRS 9 has removed the requirement for impairment assessments on equity investments. However, under BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024, dated July 29, 2024, Banks may continue to measure unquoted equity securities at the lower of cost or break-up value until December 31, 2024. Starting January 1, 2025, Banks will be required to measure unquoted equity securities at fair value, as mandated by the IFRS 9 application guidelines. For unquoted securities where the break-up value is lower than the cost, the difference has been classified as a loss and charged to the profit and loss account. Gains and losses on equity instruments at FVTPL are included in the ‘Gain on sales of securities’ line in the profit and loss account.

# 3.2.5 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Bank purchases or sells the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like advances, lending to financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account or financial institutions. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased.

a) Amortized cost (AC)

Financial assets and financial liabilities under Amortized cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These are subsequently measured at Amortized cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest income / profit / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account.

b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for debt based financial assets in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of debt based financial assets, capital gain / loss will be

HALF YEARLY REPORT JUNE 2024

# 3.2.6 Derecognition

# Financial assets

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:
- substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred; or
- the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its consolidated condensed interim statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

# Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account.

# 3.3 Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with all advances and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Bank recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money; and
- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject customer. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 60 days past due. When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Bank applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3, as described below:

# HALF YEARLY REPORT JUNE 2024

# Stage 1:

When financial instruments are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

# Stage 2:

When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

# Stage 3:

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises the LTECLs for these instruments. The Bank uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP.

# Undrawn financing commitments:

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the financings is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. For revolving facilities that include both a financings and an undrawn commitment, ECLs are calculated on un-drawn portion of the facility and presented within other liabilities.

# Guarantee and letters of credit:

The Bank estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven and internally developed credit conversion factor (CCF) and letters for guarantee and letter of credit contracts respectively. The calculation is made using a probability weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within other liabilities.

# The calculation of ECLs:

The Bank calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash flows, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:

# PD

The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the last 7 years. PDs for Non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.

# EAD

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest / profit from missed payments. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has a legal right to call it earlier. The Bank's product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail facilities, in which the Bank has the right to cancel and / or reduce the facilities with one day notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Bank does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the Bank expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the Bank future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

# LGD

The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD.

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective interest rate (at reporting date), the Bank uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date). Effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the Amortized cost of a financial liability.

To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The Bank considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics:

- History of legal certainty and enforceability
- History of enforceability and recovery

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three scenarios (a base case, a best case, a worst case). Each of these is associated with different PDs.

The Bank's management has only considered cash, liquid securities, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals, while calculating EADs.

The credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level for corporate / commercial / SME loan portfolios and at segment / product basis for retail portfolio.

# Forward looking information

In its ECL models, the Bank relies on range of the following forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

- GDP Growth
- Consumer Price Index
- Unemployment rate

# Definition of default

The concept of "impairment or "default" is critical to the implementation of IFRS 9 as it drives determination of risk parameters, i.e. PD, LGD and EAD.

This implies that if one facility of a counterparty becomes 90+ DPD in repaying its contractual dues or as defined in PRs; all other facilities would deem to be classified as stage 3.

# Write-offs

The Bank's accounting policy under IFRS 9 remains the same as it was under SBP regulations / exiting reporting framework.

# 3.4 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held-for-sale

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held-for-sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of derecognition.

Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortized while they are classified as held for sale. Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the statement of financial position. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the statement of financial position.

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The basis for accounting estimates adopted in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements is the same as that applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for IFRS 9 as mentioned above.

# 5 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The financial risk management objectives and policies adopted by the Bank are consistent with those as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

10.5.3 General provision includes provision amounting to Rs.101 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 270 million) pertaining to overseas advances to meet the requirements of regulatory authorities of the respective countries in which the Bank operates where IFRS 9 has not been implemented.

10.5.4 The SBP has allowed specific relaxation to the Bank for non-classification of overdue loans of certain Public Sector Entities (PSEs) which are guaranteed by Government of Pakistan as non-performing loans up till December 31, 2024. No provision is required against these loans; however, mark-up is being suspended as required by the Prudential Regulations. Further SBP has allowed specific relaxation on the requirement for ECL against overdue foreign currency loans of certain Public Sector Entities, either uptill December 31, 2024 or permanently.

10.5.5 These represent non-performing advances for agriculture finance which have been classified as loss and fully provided for more than 3 years. These non-performing advances have been charged off by extinguishing them against the provision held in accordance with Prudential Regulations for Agriculture Financing issued by the SBP. This charge off does not, in any way, prejudice the Bank's right of recovery from these customers.

# 37. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted instruments classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 37.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:
