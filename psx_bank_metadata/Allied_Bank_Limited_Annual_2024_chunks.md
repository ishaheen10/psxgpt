# SCALING NEW HEIGHTS: TWENTY YEARS OF TRANSFORMATION

The theme of this year’s Annual Report, Scaling New Heights: 20 Years of Transformation, draws inspiration from the Bank’s recent K2 Base Camp trek—a journey that mirrors our two-decade-long commitment to sustainability, resilience and growth.

During the expedition, our team collected 1,200 kgs of trash, underscoring our dedication to environmental stewardship. This effort was complemented by awareness sessions held for the local communities to promote awareness about sustainability and proper waste disposal—a reflection of our belief in empowering communities and fostering long-term change.

As we celebrate 20 years of transformation, this Annual Report reflects on the milestones we’ve achieved, the challenges we’ve overcome and the future we are building. We have scaled new heights in financial innovation, customer-centric solutions and sustainable practices, all while maintaining a steadfast commitment to the communities we serve.

Our theme encapsulates this journey of growth and transformation. It highlights our ability to navigate complex terrains, adapt to evolving landscapes, and emerge stronger, just as the K2 team did. It also serves as a reminder that true success lies not only in reaching the summit but in the legacy we leave behind—whether it’s through sustainable practices, community engagement or transformative financial solutions.

# TWENTY YEARS OF TRUST, GROWTH EXCELLENCE

2024 marks the Twenty (20) Years milestone of recapitalization of Allied Bank Limited by the Ibrahim Group. The journey from its recapitalization in 2004 to becoming one of the leading banks in Pakistan in 2024 is a story of strategic vision, robust management and consistent performance.

The year 2004 marked a turning point for Allied Bank. Facing financial distress, the State Bank of Pakistan undertook the reconstruction of the capital of the Allied Bank under the instructions of the Privatisation Commission of Pakistan whereby Ibrahim Group took over the control of the Bank. This not only stabilized the Bank’s financial position but also led to a change in ownership and management. Subsequently, the Bank was renamed Allied Bank Limited in 2005, heralding a new era of growth and transformation with a Vision “To become a dynamic and efficient Bank providing integrated solutions in order to be the first-choice Bank for customers”.

Under the stewardship of the new Board and Management, Allied Bank embarked on a journey of rapid expansion and technological advancement. The Bank invested heavily in modernizing its infrastructure, introducing state-of-the-art banking technologies and expanding its branch network. The Bank’s focus on digital transformation not only enhanced customer experience but also improved operational efficiency.

Building on the foundations, the Bank continued to strengthen its market position characterized by impressive financial performance. Allied Bank consistently posted strong financial results, with significant growth in deposits, advances and profitability. The Bank’s prudent risk management practices, combined with a diversified product portfolio, contributed to its robust performance.

In the last few years, Allied Bank has placed a strong emphasis on sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR). The Bank has undertaken numerous initiatives aimed at promoting financial inclusion, supporting education and contributing to environmental sustainability. The Bank’s commitment to CSR is reflected in its various programs, including scholarships for underprivileged students, support for healthcare initiatives and efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. Allied Bank’s focus on sustainability is not only aligned with global best practices but also resonates with the Bank’s vision of creating long-term value for its stakeholders.

During the year 2024, Allied Bank celebrated its rich history and transformation journey by holding events in Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad and Multan. These celebrations were a testament to the dedication and hard work of the Bank’s employees, who have played a pivotal role in the Bank’s success over the past two decades. The events provided an opportunity to reflect on the Bank’s achievements, recognize the contributions of its employees and envision the future with renewed enthusiasm.

Today, the Bank stands as a financially robust institution with a deposit base of over Rs. 2 trillion, total asset base exceeding Rs. 2.8 trillion and a diverse portfolio of advances supplemented by industry’s lowest NPL and highest Capital Adequacy Ratio. The branch network of the Bank has grown to over 1,500 branches across the country, offering a wide range of products and services to cater to the diverse needs of its customers.

As Allied Bank Limited celebrates its 20-year journey since recapitalization, it stands as a testament to the power of strategic vision, effective management, and unwavering commitment to excellence. The Bank’s transformation from a financially distressed entity to a market leader is a story of resilience, innovation and growth.

With a strong foundation and a clear vision for the future, Allied Bank is well-positioned to continue its legacy of excellence and contribute to the economic development of Pakistan. The Bank has been honoured multiple times on international platforms by world-renowned organizations, including The Banker (Financial Times Group, U.K.), FinanceAsia and Euromoney – a true testament to Allied Bank’s achievements.

# CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE

# Chairman Board of Directors

# Global and National Economic Overview

The global economy demonstrated notable resilience in 2024, achieving moderate growth despite challenging conditions. Central banks’ monetary policy measures successfully began to curb inflationary pressures worldwide. While we’re witnessing encouraging signs of stabilization, potential risks remain due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and trade disputes. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts global GDP growth at 3.2% for 2024–a moderate figure compared to the pre-pandemic average of 3.7%. Global inflation projections have been slightly revised downward from 5.8% to 5.7%, according to the October 2024 World Economic Outlook.

Pakistan’s economy showed resilience and positive momentum throughout 2024, with improving macroeconomic fundamentals. Tightened monetary policy effectively eased inflationary pressures, while disciplined fiscal management facilitated a shift toward fiscal surplus. Improved export performance and increased remittance inflows strengthened our current account position, reflecting a more stable external sector. The IMF revised Pakistan’s GDP growth forecast to 2.5% for 2024–slightly higher than its earlier 2.4% estimate–marking a significant turnaround from the 0.2% contraction recorded in 2023. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) similarly projects 2.5% economic growth.

Against this backdrop, the domestic banking sector delivered strong performance in 2024, with increases in total assets, investments, and deposits.

# Digital Transformation in Banking

The banking industry has undergone a profound transformation with the adoption of digital technologies, driven by customer demand for convenience, speed, and personalized experiences. Competition from fintech firms and evolving regulatory requirements have further accelerated innovation. In response, the banking sector has strategically integrated technological advancements including:

- Artificial Intelligence: AI utilizes algorithms and neural networks to process vast data amounts, enabling more informed decisions. AI-driven machine learning models continuously improve fraud detection, credit scoring, and customer segmentation. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants efficiently handle customer queries, reducing reliance on human agents while improving service quality.
- Quantum Computing: By processing data significantly faster than classical systems and analysing millions of market variables in real-time, quantum computing enables advanced solutions for complex calculations, precise investment recommendations, and enhanced portfolio management.
- Cryptography: Banks extensively use cryptography to secure transactions, protect customer data, and authenticate users. It forms the foundation for technologies such as blockchain and tokenization, ensuring secure and transparent financial operations.
- Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT): These enhance data transparency, immutability, and decentralization, addressing inefficiencies in traditional banking. They enable cost-effective cross-border payments and streamline global trade through smart contracts. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) built on DLT offer secure, efficient transactions, accelerating remittances and digital payments in underserved regions.
- Regulatory Technology (RegTech): To mitigate compliance risks, banks leverage RegTech innovations to automate processes, reduce costs, and ensure adherence to legal standards. These technologies streamline KYC procedures using AI for identity validation and enhance anti-money laundering efforts through real-time detection of suspicious transactions.
- Green Fintech: This focuses on technologies promoting environmental sustainability and aligning financial practices with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals. Platforms like Stripe Climate help assess carbon footprints of financed projects, while AI algorithms evaluate and prioritize funding for renewable energy initiatives.

# National Payment Ecosystem Advancements

The national payment ecosystem has experienced significant advancements, with continued growth in digital payments driven by increasing accessibility and adoption. Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) and Branchless Banking (BB) providers are introducing innovative products and services that pave the way for a more digitalized economy. The introduction of QR-based payments through Raast is reducing transaction costs for merchants while contributing to broader adoption of digital payments.

The SBP has initiated several measures to accelerate economic digitization, including:

- Onboarding various private and public sector entities onto the Raast platform
- Integrating Raast-Buna for cross-border payment settlement in the Arab region
- Launching interoperable Raast P2M (Person to Merchant) services to facilitate digital payment acceptance through QR codes, Raast Alias, IBAN, and Request to Pay (RTP)

The myABL Coins loyalty program incentivizes customer engagement by allowing users to earn points for transactions made through ABL Debit and Credit Cards, both locally and internationally.

# FUTURE OUTLOOK

The IMF expects global economic growth to remain stable despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges, projecting global GDP growth at 3.3% for both 2025 and 2026. Domestically, the IMF has revised Pakistan’s GDP growth projection for 2025 to 3.0%, a slight downward adjustment from its earlier 3.2% estimate. The SBP’s Monetary Policy Committee expects GDP growth for FY25 to remain between 2.5% and 3.5%. For 2026, the IMF maintains its growth forecast at 4.0%.

The future of banking relies on a platform-based operating model integrating advanced technologies with core systems. This approach seamlessly connects financing, payments.

# CEO’S REVIEW

# Aizid Razzaq Gill

# Chief Executive Officer

# Global and National Economic Overview

The global economy is on a path of gradual recovery, experiencing moderate growth in 2024. Inflation continues to cool down as most of the world’s major central banks have initiated rate-cutting cycles. However, growth remains uneven across different regions, with emerging markets and developing economies generally outpacing advanced economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its January 2025 World Economic Outlook (WEO), has maintained its global growth estimate at 3.2% for 2024.

In 2024, Pakistan’s economy exhibited a modest recovery, with GDP growth estimated at 2.5%. Inflationary pressure has eased significantly after peaking at 38.0% in May 2023, due to tightened fiscal and monetary policies. CPI inflation decreased to 4.1% on a year-on-year basis in December 2024, compared to 29.7% in December 2023. Pakistan’s banking industry demonstrated strong performance, with total assets expanding 16% to Rs. 52,285 billion. This growth was augmented by a 15% increase in net investments and a 30% escalation in gross advances, reflecting enhanced credit deployment. Concurrently, deposits registered a 9% expansion, reaching Rs. 30,283 billion, underscoring liquidity resilience. These financial indicators affirm the sector’s stability and sustained growth.

# Macroeconomic Developments

The year 2024 began with uncertain expectations regarding economic recovery. However, the global economy showed signs of stabilization in both advanced and emerging markets as inflationary pressures, high policy rates and lingering post-pandemic effects gradually subsided. In the medium term, geopolitical tensions, such as trade disputes and ongoing geographic conflicts may continue to challenge macroeconomic stability. International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its January 2025 World Economic Outlook (WEO), has maintained global growth forecast of 3.2% for 2024, aligning with its projection from January 2024 WEO.

As a result of monetary tightening measures implemented by central banks worldwide, the global economy is emerging from one of the most significant inflation surges in recent years. Consequently, the IMF, in its January 2025 WEO, has revised its global inflation forecast, projecting a decline to 5.7% in 2024 slightly lower than its earlier projection of 5.8% in the October 2024 publication.

Pakistan’s economy demonstrated positive progress in 2024, with key macroeconomic indicators showing improvement. Inflation has slowed due to monetary policy measures, effective fiscal consolidation has led to a fiscal surplus, and rising exports and remittances have contributed to a surplus in the current account.

The agriculture sector has also shown improvements, supported by the timely availability of essential farm inputs, agricultural credit, quality seeds, fertilizers, and mechanization support. Agriculture credit disbursement increased by 8.5% reaching Rs. 925.7 billion during Jul-Nov FY’25, compared to Rs. 853.0 billion during Jul-Nov FY’24.

The Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) sector experienced a decline of 1.25% during Jul-Nov FY’25, compared to contraction of 1.9% during Jul-Nov FY’24. The auto industry achieved a major milestone with the commencement of electric vehicle production in Pakistan. This sector saw a 28.3% increase in production, while sales grew by 28.2%.

On the domestic front, the IMF has projected Pakistan’s GDP growth at 3.0% for 2025, reflecting a 0.2% downward revision from its previous estimate of 3.2% in the October 2024 WEO.

For the year under review, profit before taxation for the year ended December 31, 2024 stood at Rs. 87,928 million, reflecting a 3% increase from Rs. 85,757 million in the corresponding year.

ended December 31, 2023. This growth was primarily driven by higher net markup and non-markup income and credit loss reversals partially offset by higher operating expenses.

The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024, was 50.96%, compared to 52.56% for the previous year. The tax charge for 2024 stood at Rs. 44,812 million, slightly lower than Rs. 45,074 million in 2023, reflecting a 1% decrease.

# ROLE OF BANK IN GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT

# VALUE CHAIN AFFECTING THE BANKING INDUSTRY

Financial Supply Chain

Pakistan is located at a region which has great political, economic and strategic importance. Pakistan has the potential to develop transit economy due to its strategic location by offering direct and shorter trade routes to China, Central Asian Countries and Afghanistan with Middle East, Africa and Europe. However, the economic potential is still largely untapped mainly due to conditions in Afghanistan, trade restrictions on Iran and due to long standing political tensions between Pakistan and its eastern neighbor India. Improvement in the security conditions in Afghanistan, lifting or easing of trade restrictions on Iran and progress in relations with India have the potential to increase trade volumes and to bring mutual economic benefits resulting into establishing formal banking channels, digital payment systems and offering related banking services contributing to economic growth of the region.

Allied Bank Limited being a financial institution manages money flows in partnering supply chain organizations, by developing innovative methods for streamlining their financial distribution networks. The role of the Bank in value chain is to improve inter-organization money flows. The Banks provides a set of financial and technological tools to help companies improve working capital management and free up cash trapped in supply chain processes and transactions. Furthermore, the Bank’s role as an intermediary between suppliers and buyers facilitates in:

- Supplier prefers to get money for delivered products or services sooner whereas,
- Buyers want to extend payment terms.

Banks offer services to improve the financial health of the supply chain by reducing both buyer and seller working capital. The removal of Pakistan from the grey list of FATF in 2022 has brought financial ease to some extent and has helped in securing much needed economic support from the global financial institutions.

The Bank continuously realigns its strategies by adapting to evolving regulations, embracing digital transformation and keeping in view all economic, legal and geopolitical factors with an objective of maximizing long-term shareholder value.

# SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

The Pak Rupee remained relatively stable during the year and, on year-on-year basis, it appreciated by around 1.19% against US Dollar in the Inter Bank Exchange Market. The Bank also conducts stress testing of the foreign exchange, equity and fixed income portfolio which is reviewed by the Bank’s senior management and Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC).

Foreign Exchange Risk exposes the Bank to changes in the value of exposure denominated in foreign currencies due to the exchange rate fluctuations and volatility. The types of the instruments exposed to this risk are mainly investments in foreign branches, advances and deposits denominated in foreign currency, cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, etc.

The Bank’s Foreign Exchange Risk is largely mitigated by following a matched funding policy, whereas, for any mismatched exposures, the Bank utilizes appropriate derivative instruments such as Forwards and Swaps. The Bank maintains adequate regulatory capital to cover against foreign exchange risk.

The Regulations require the Bank to place before the Audit Committee, and upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, place before the Board of Directors for their review and approval, its related party transactions. We are only required and have ensured compliance of this requirement to the extent of the approval of the related party transactions by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the Statement of Compliance does not appropriately reflect the Bank’s compliance, in all material respects, with the requirements contained in the Regulations as applicable to the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2024.

# Education and Training on Cybersecurity Risks

Cybersecurity risks are continuously evolving as the constant focus on digitalization of the financial sector has resulted in shift of financial transaction from conventional means to digital channels. These ever-evolving cyber risks require continuous education and training of relevant stakeholders specially employees and customers to address these risks. The Management’s IT Steering Committee reviews and determines the adequacy of the Bank’s training plan including information/cyber security training for the employees. Major initiatives taken during the year for training of employees, customers and general public, are;

- Issuance of monthly “Security News Bulletin” for education of employees
- Training programs for employees on Information Security Awareness
- SMS Alerts to customers on security of Confidential Information
- Social Media campaigns for general public on Security Awareness

In order to support data driven business decisions for customers, the Bank by using Big Data technologies has created Data Lake comprising of structured and unstructured data. The Bank is also working with multiple Data Science companies to capitalize on the investment of Big Data for implementing multiple use cases through machine learning models, and in turn, improve and personalize customer experiences.

Similarly, on the FX side the Bank expect USD/PKR rate to remain mostly stable and will try to capitalize on movements in swap market to generate additional revenues. Simultaneously, ABL shall continue to work in close coordination with CIBG, CRBG and IBG to increase trade and remittance value and service its clients in the best way possible.

The group continues to drive profitability by diversifying the corporate segment, expanding its client base, and generating consistent revenue through cross-selling financial products and maximizing fee-based income streams.

# Economic outlook

Pakistan’s economy demonstrated positive progress in 2024, with key macroeconomic indicators showing improvement. Inflation has slowed due to monetary policy measures, effective fiscal consolidation has led to a fiscal surplus, and rising exports and remittances have contributed to a surplus in the current account. Accordingly, the IMF has revised Pakistan’s 2024 GDP growth forecast to 2.5%, up from its previous projection of 2.4% in the October 2024 WEO. State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has estimated GDP growth of Pakistan at 2.5% for 2024, a significant improvement from -0.2% in 2023.

Inflation has remained a significant challenge in recent years, both globally and domestically. However, due to base effect, stable food prices owing to improved supply and the diminishing impact of previous gas tariff hikes have contributed to a notable decline in inflation. In December 2024, consumer price index (CPI) stood at 4.1%, down from 4.9% in the month of November 2024 and 29.7% in the month of December 2023. In response to easing inflationary pressure, SBP has progressively reduced the policy rate by 1,000 basis points since June 2024, bringing it to 12% in January 2025.

# CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY

# Chairman Overview on Sustainability Practices

Sustainability is a rapidly growing field that connects environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues with economic impacts across various industries, including banking. At Allied Bank Limited (ABL), we recognize the importance of ESG and are committed to driving meaningful change by leveraging our financial expertise and resources. Our goal is to extend our positive influence beyond our immediate operations and contribute to a more sustainable future.

The State Bank of Pakistan regulates sustainable development practices in the banking sector, prompting a shift towards more responsible and environmentally friendly business models. In response, ABL has adopted green banking strategies, integrating corporate social responsibility (CSR) into its operations. We are actively developing green products and services to promote sustainable business practices.

In the past, businesses viewed ESG initiatives as an added cost. However, today, sustainable practices are seen as a valuable investment that drives innovation, opens new market opportunities, and enhances value for all stakeholders. Allied Bank’s ESG initiatives focus on introducing banking products, services, and operations that positively impact the environment and society while fostering a sustainable governance framework.

Our sustainability report provides detailed insights and statistics on ABL’s sustainable initiatives in an organized and transparent manner, helping stakeholders better understand our progress. By embracing innovative environmental solutions, promoting social equity, and maintaining strong governance standards, ABL aims not only to improve financial performance but also to make a meaningful contribution to a more sustainable world.

# Risk Management

The Bank recognizes that its relationship with obligors in terms of financing decisions may have an adverse impact on the natural as well as social environment. In order to mitigate this risk, Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) has been made an integral part of our credit approval process. The financing function of the Bank strives to remain aware of environmental and social risks faced by its obligors. The Bank assists its obligors to understand their responsibilities with regards to the protection of the natural environment and their responsibilities to society as a whole. All new loan proposals and credit renewals for the applicable categories are screened against required standards.

The Bank has developed a comprehensive Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) comprising of a set of policies, procedures, tools, and internal capacity to identify and manage the Bank’s exposure to the Environmental and Social (E&S) risks of its borrowers and customers. The ESMS states the Bank’s commitment to E&S management, explains its procedures for identifying, assessing, and managing the E&S risks of financial transactions, defines the decision-making process, describes the roles, responsibilities, and capacity needs of staff for doing so, as well as states the documentation and record-keeping requirements. It also provides guidance on how to screen and categorize transactions based on E&S risks, conduct E&S due diligence, and monitor the borrower and customer’s E&S performance.

|Key Audit Matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|

|1. Expected credit loss against advances|As disclosed in Note 9 to the unconsolidated financial statements, the Bank’s advances represent 37.32% of its total assets as of 31 December 2024. During the year, the Bank has adopted IFRS 9 - “Financial Instruments” (as applicable in Pakistan), which requires a forward-looking approach to estimate the Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”) against advances and other financial instruments. As allowed under IFRS 9, the Bank has adopted the requirements of the standard retrospectively, without restating the previous year’s financial information.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.
- • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- • Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.
- • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh.

# Amendments to IFRS 9 - Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments

On 30 May 2024, the IASB issued Amendments to IFRS 9, Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments (the Amendments). The Amendments include:

- A clarification that a financial liability is derecognised on the ‘settlement date’ and introduce an accounting policy choice (if specific conditions are met) to derecognise financial liabilities settled using an electronic payment system before the settlement date.
- Additional guidance on how the contractual cash flows for financial assets with environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) and similar features should be assessed.
- Clarifications on what constitute ‘non-recourse features’ and what are the characteristics of contractually linked instruments.
- The introduction of disclosures for financial instruments with contingent features and additional disclosure requirements for equity instruments classified at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI).

The Amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or after 1 January 2026. Early adoption is permitted, with an option to early adopt the amendments for classification of financial assets and related disclosures only. The Bank is currently not intending to early adopt the Amendments.

# Amendments to IAS 1 - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current

The amendments to IAS 1 specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments clarify:

- What is meant by a right to defer settlement.
- That a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period.
- That classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right.
- That only if an embedded derivative in a convertible liability is itself an equity instrument would the terms of a liability not impact its classification.

In addition, an entity is required to disclose when a liability arising from a loan agreement is classified as non-current and the entity’s right to defer settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants within twelve months. The Bank is currently working to identify all impacts, the amendments will have on these unconsolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements.

# Lack of exchangeability – Amendments to IAS 21

In August 2023, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates to specify how an entity should assess whether a currency is exchangeable and how it should determine a spot exchange rate when exchangeability is lacking. The amendments also require disclosure of information that enables users of its financial statements to understand how the currency not being exchangeable into the other currency affects, or is expected to affect, the entity’s financial performance, financial position and cash flows. The amendments will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025. Early adoption is permitted, but will need to be disclosed.

# IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts

In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17), a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure. Once effective, IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4) that was issued in 2005. IFRS 17 applies to all types of insurance contracts (i.e., life, non-life, direct insurance and re-insurance), regardless of the type of entities that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features. A few scope exceptions will apply. The overall objective of IFRS 17 is to provide an accounting model for insurance contracts that is more useful and consistent for insurers. In contrast to the requirements in IFRS 4, which are largely based on grandfathering previous local accounting policies, IFRS 17 provides a comprehensive model for insurance contracts, covering all relevant accounting aspects. The core of IFRS 17 is the general model, supplemented by:

# 2.4.4 Classification of investments

# Debt Securities

- In classifying investments under Amortized Cost, the Bank determines the business model of the securities as “Hold to Collect” where the intentions are to hold the security until maturity to collect contractual cash flows based solely on payments of principal and interest. However, the sale of securities under this model is still possible under certain circumstances.
- In classifying investments as “Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income”, the Bank determines the business model as Hold to Collect and Sell as the intentions are to hold the asset to collect contractual cash flows based solely on payments of principal and interest and sell the asset to manage liquidity needs or in order to maintain a particular interest yield profile or to match the duration of the assets to the duration of the liabilities that those assets are funding.
- The investments which are not classified as “Amortized Cost” and “Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income” are classified as “Fair Value Through Profit and Loss”. The business model for such investments is to realize the cash flows through the sale of assets (Held for Trading).

# Equity Investment

Equity investments, other than those in subsidiaries and associates, are classified as “Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income” where the Bank determines equity instruments are not held for trading purposes and elects to present the fair value changes in Other Comprehensive Income. The equity instruments bought with the intention for trading are classified as “Fair Value Through Profit and Loss”.

The application of the above standards are not expected to have a material impact on the Bank’s financial statements, in the period of applicability, except for IFRS 18. The Bank is currently working to identify all impacts IFRS 18 will have on the unconsolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements.

# 2.4.5 Depreciation, amortization and revaluation of operating fixed assets

In making estimates of depreciation and amortization, the management uses method which reflects the pattern in which economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Bank and estimates the useful life. The method applied and useful lives estimated are reviewed at each financial year end and if there is a change in the expected pattern or timing of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the assets, the estimate would be changed to reflect the change in pattern. Such a change is accounted for as change in accounting estimates in accordance with International Accounting Standard 8 - Accounting Policies, ‘Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’. Further, the bank estimates the revalued amount of land and buildings on a regular basis. The estimates are based on the valuations carried out by independent professional valuers under the market conditions.

# 2.4.6 Fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities

The fair value of the assets and liabilities is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Bank categorizes fair value measurements within the following fair value hierarchy:

- a) Level 1 - These are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Bank can access at the measurement date.
- b) Level 2 - These are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
- c) Level 3 - These are input for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable Inputs).

# 2.4.7 Lease term

The Bank applies judgement to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized.

The equity investments classified as “fair value through other comprehensive income” are not subject to impairment testing. The gains and losses on these investments is taken to “Other comprehensive income” and are not recycled to “Profit and Loss Account”.

# 4.2 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 (read with IFRS 9 application instructions issued by SBP) using modified retrospective approach with date of initial application as January 01, 2024, which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements. In terms of the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening unappropriated profit and surplus on revaluation of assets - net of tax at the beginning of the current period without restating the comparative figures. The impact on carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities is disclosed in Note 4.2.4.

# 4.2.1 Scope of IFRS 9 application

IFRS 9 has been applicable in several overseas jurisdictions at various effective dates starting from January 01, 2018. The requirements of this standard were already incorporated in the Bank’s financial statements for the jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted.

The SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 dated January 22, 2025 (Letters) has made certain amendments and clarified the timelines of some of the SBP’s IFRS 9 Application Instructions. The Letters have provided clarifications / relaxations on measurement of unquoted equity securities, modification accounting, maintenance of general provisions over and above ECL, accounting methodology for Islamic Banking Institutions and treatment of charity. Accordingly, the Bank has adopted the treatment as instructed in the aforementioned Letters in these unconsolidated financial statements. In addition, the SBP in a letter BPRD / RPD / 822456/25 dated January 22, 2025 has allowed extension for application of Effective Interest Rate up to December 31, 2025.

The Bank has not recognised any general provisions over and above expected credit losses in these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 4.2.2 Significant differences from accounting policies applicable till December 31, 2023 before adoption of IFRS 9

# 4.2.2.1 Classification of financial assets

IFRS 9 introduced a new classification model for financial assets that is more principle-based than the previous requirements. Financial assets are classified according to their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business models under which they are held. Instruments will be classified either at amortised cost, the newly established measurement category fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). For equity investment that are not held for trading, an election is available to the Bank to classify these either through FVTPL or FVOCI. The previous accounting policies were based on instrument by instrument classification into Held for trading, Held to maturity and Available for Sale categories as disclosed in Note 4.3 to the annual financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 4.2.2.2 Impairment of debt investments and loans and advances

The new IFRS 9 impairment requirements eliminate the previous approach for the recognition of credit losses, i.e., it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. Instead, an entity always accounts for ECLs, and updates the loss allowance for changes in these ECLs at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition. Consequently, the holder of the financial asset needs to take into account more timely and forward-looking information in order to provide users of financial statements with meaningful information about the ECLs on financial instruments that are in the scope of these impairment requirements. The previous impairment requirements were based solely on Prudential regulations of SBP as disclosed in Note 4.11 to the annual financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 4.2.2.3 Impairment of equity investments

Previously, investments classified as available for sale were required to be tested for impairment and if there is an objective evidence, impairment was required to be booked. Under IFRS 9 regime, no impairment is required against such investments which are carried at FVOCI as the gain or loss on remeasurement will permanently remain in OCI/Surplus on revaluation of Investments. The previous accounting policies are disclosed in Note 4.3 & 4.11 to the annual financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 4.2.3 Material accounting policies applicable from January 01, 2024 as a result of adoption of IFRS 9

# 4.2.3.1 Financial assets – initial recognition

Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value, plus in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. When the transaction price of the instrument differs from the fair value at origination and the fair value is based on a valuation technique using only inputs observable in market transactions, the Bank recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value in profit and loss account. In those cases where fair value is based on models for which some of the inputs are not observable, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value is deferred and is only recognised in profit and loss account when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

# 4.2.3.3 Financial assets at amortized cost

The Bank classifies its financial assets at amortized cost only if both of the following conditions are met:

- The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows
- The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding

The details of these conditions are outlined below:

## Chunk 360


# a. Business model assessment

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective. The Bank’s business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Bank’s Board/ Board Committees
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank’s assessment

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking ‘worst case’ or ‘stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Bank’s original expectations, the Bank does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# b. The SPPI test

As a second step of its classification process the Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial asset to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. The assessment of SPPI aims to identify whether the contractual cash flows are ‘solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding’.

‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset. The most significant elements of ‘interest’ within a lending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest rate is set.

In contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than trivial exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding. In such cases, the financial asset is required to be measured at FVTPL.

After initial measurement, these financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost.

# 4.2.3.4 Debt instruments at FVOCI

The Bank applies this new category under IFRS 9 when both of the following conditions are met:

- The instrument is held within a business model, the objective of which is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
- The contractual terms of the financial asset meet the SPPI test

FVOCI debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising due to changes in fair value recognised in OCI. Interest income at EIR and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account.

The ECLs for debt instruments measured at FVOCI do not reduce the carrying amount of these financial assets in the statement of financial position, which remains at fair value. Instead, an amount equal to the allowance that would arise if the assets were measured at amortised cost is recognised in OCI as an accumulated impairment amount, with a corresponding charge to profit and loss account. The accumulated loss recognised in OCI is recycled to the profit and loss account upon derecognition of the assets.

On derecognition, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in OCI are reclassified from OCI to profit and loss account.

# 4.2.3.5 Equity instruments at FVOCI

Upon initial recognition, the Bank elects to classify its equity investments at FVOCI which are not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable.

Gains and losses on these equity instruments are never recycled to profit and loss account. Dividends are recognised in profit and loss account when the right of the payment has been established, except when the Bank benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment.

# 4.2.3.6 Financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL

Financial assets and financial liabilities in this category are those that are:

- held for trading, that is, they have been purchased or issued primarily for short-term profit-making through trading activities or form part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together, for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit taking, or
- not held for trading and have been either designated by management upon initial recognition, or mandatorily required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9

Financial assets are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in profit and loss account. Interest and dividend income or expense is recorded in net trading income according to the terms of the contract, or when the right to payment has been established.

# 4.2.3.7 Financial liabilities at amortised cost

Financial liabilities with a fixed maturity are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. These include Bills payable, Borrowings, Deposits and certain items within Other Liabilities.

# 4.2.3.8 Derecognition of financial assets

# 4.2.3.8.1 Derecognition due to substantial modification of terms and conditions

The Bank derecognises a financial asset, such as a loan to a customer, when the terms and conditions have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new loan, with the difference recognised as a derecognition gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The newly recognised loan is classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes, unless it is deemed to be purchased originated credit impaired.

If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different, the modification does not result in derecognition. Based on the change in cash flows discounted at the original EIR, the Bank records a modification gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded.

The gain/(loss) on derecognition of financial asset is calculated as the difference between the book value (including impairment) and the proceeds received.

# 4.2.3.8.2 Derecognition other than due to substantial modification of terms and conditions

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The Bank also derecognises the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.

# 4.2.3.10 Impairment of financial assets

# 4.2.3.10.1 Overview of the ECL principles

The adoption of IFRS 9 has fundamentally changed the Bank’s loan loss impairment method by replacing the incurred loss approach of the local regulations with a forward-looking ECL approach. The Bank has been recording the allowance for expected credit losses for all loans and other debt financial assets held at amortized cost or FVOCI, together with loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantee contracts. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under IFRS 9. Under the SBP’s instructions, local currency credit exposures guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL.

# 4.2.3.10.2 The calculation of ECLs

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss (LTECL)), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL).

The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its financial assets into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

- Stage 1: When loans are first recognized, the Bank recognizes an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 loans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 2.
- Stage 2: When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination (SICR), the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 3.
- Stage 3: Loans considered credit-impaired. The Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs with PD set at 100%. Under SBP’s instructions, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, Stage 3 allowance would be taken as higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under Prudential Regulations.

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject borrower. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 60 days past due.

The key elements of ECL calculations are as follows:

- The Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and.

# Impact on regulatory capital

The implementation of IFRS 9 has led to a decrease in the regulatory capital of banks, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has concluded that it may be suitable for banks to establish a transitional arrangement regarding the impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the Application Instructions issued by the SBP outlines this transitional arrangement.

This arrangement specifically pertains to provisions for Stage 1 and Stage 2 financial assets. It requires adjustments to Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. If there is a decrease in CET1 capital due to new provisions, after accounting for tax effects, upon the adoption of an ECL accounting model, the reduction in CET1 capital (referred to as the “transitional adjustment amount”) must be partially reinstated (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over a “transition period” of five years.

Additionally, the SBP has permitted adjustments to the amounts of Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions in Tier 2 Capital that have not been added back to CET1, and vice versa, as specified in Annexure A of BPRD Circular No. 16 of 2024, dated July 29, 2024. The Bank has not elected to utilize the IFRS 9 transitional arrangement.

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# for the year ended December 31, 2024

# (e) Reclassification from retired categories with no change in measurement

Investments are initially recognized at fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.

In addition to the above, the following debt instruments have been reclassified to new categories under IFRS 9, as their previous categories under existing local regulations were ‘retired’, with no changes to their measurement basis:

- (i) Those previously classified as available for sale and now classified as measured at FVOCI; and
- (ii) Those previously classified as held to maturity and now classified as measured at amortised cost.
- (ii) Those previously classified as held for trading and now classified as measured at FVTPL.

Quoted securities, other than those classified as “amortized cost” and investments in subsidiaries, are carried at market value. Debt securities classified as “amortized cost” are subsequently measured at amortized cost.

Unrealized surplus or (deficit) arising on revaluation of the Bank’s “Fair Value Through Profit and Loss” investment portfolio is taken to the profit and loss account. Surplus or (deficit) arising on revaluation of debt securities classified as “Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income” is kept in a separate account shown in the statement of financial position as a component of Equity.

On derecognition, the cumulative gains or losses previously recognized in Other Comprehensive Income is reclassified to Profit and Loss Account. The surplus or (deficit) arising on equity securities designated as “Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income” is taken to Other Comprehensive Income. Upon disposal, the cumulative surplus or (deficit) previously recognized in Other Comprehensive Income is reclassified from equity to Unappropriated Profit as a reclassification adjustment and is never recycled to Profit and Loss Account.

# 4.3 Cash and cash equivalents

For the purpose of Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents include cash and balances with treasury banks and balances with other banks (net of overdrawn nostro balances) in current and deposit accounts.

# 4.4 Lendings to or borrowings from financial institutions

The Bank enters into transactions of borrowing (re-purchase) from and lending (reverse re-purchase) to financial institutions, at contracted rates for a specified period of time. These are recorded as under:

- a) Sale under re-purchase agreements
- Securities sold subject to a re-purchase agreement are retained in the financial statements as investments and the counter party liability is included in borrowings from financial institutions. The differential in sale and re-purchase value is accrued on a prorata basis and recorded as mark-up expense.

b) Purchase under resale agreements

Securities held as collateral are not recognized in the financial statements, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability under borrowings from financial institutions.

In Bai Muajjal, the Bank purchases and sells Shariah Compliant instruments including sukuks on credit to other financial institutions. The credit price is agreed at the time of sale and such proceeds are received at the end of the credit period. Expected profit / expense is recognized on accrual basis.

In Musharaka and Mudaraba, the Bank invests in the Shariah compliant business pools of the financial institutions at the agreed profit and loss sharing ratio. Expected profit is recognized on accrual basis.

Other borrowings including borrowings from SBP are recorded at the proceeds received. Mark-up on such borrowings is charged to the Profit and Loss Account on a time proportion basis.

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# for the year ended December 31, 2024

When an asset or class of assets is revalued, any increase in the carrying amount arising on revaluation is recorded through other comprehensive income and credited to the revaluation reserve in equity. However, the increase shall be recognized in the Profit and Loss Account to the extent it reverses previously recognised revaluation decrease/impairment loss of the same asset in the Profit and Loss Account, net of amortization or depreciation had no revaluation decrease/impairment been required for the asset in prior years. A decrease resulting from a revaluation is initially charged directly against any related revaluation surplus held in respect of that asset and the remaining portion being charged as an expense.

The surplus on revaluation of fixed assets to the extent of incremental depreciation (net of deferred tax) charged on the related assets is transferred directly to un-appropriated profit.

Revaluation of entire class of assets is carried out by independent professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity (every third year) to ensure that the carrying amount of the entire class of assets does not differ materially from their fair value.

An item of property and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is recognized in the Profit and Loss Account in the year the asset is derecognized, except that the related surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of deferred tax) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the Profit and Loss Account.

# b) Intangible assets

Intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any. The cost of intangible assets is amortized over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method. Amortization is charged from the month the assets are available for use at the rate stated in note 11.2. The useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.

# c) Capital work-in-progress

Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any.

# 4.8 Lease liability and right of use asset

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the Banks’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The carrying amount is remeasured/adjusted if there are changes in the future cash flows or the lease term.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date. On subsequent measurement, right-of-use assets are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses and are adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term as this method closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits. Carrying amount of the lease liability is derecognised upon termination of the lease contract with corresponding adjustment to right-of-use asset. Gain or loss on termination of lease contract is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.

The Bank has elected not to recognize a right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense in the Profit or Loss Account on a straight-line basis.

# 4.9 Taxation

# a) Current

Provision for current taxation is based on taxable income for the year determined in accordance with the prevailing laws for taxation. The charge for current tax is calculated using the prevailing tax rates or tax rates expected to apply to the profits for the year.

# b) Prior

The taxation charge for prior years represents adjustments to the tax charge relating to prior years, arising from assessments or changes in laws and changes in estimates made during the current year.

# 20.2 Workers Welfare Fund

Supreme Court of Pakistan vide order dated November 10, 2016 held that the amendments made in the law through Finance Act 2008, introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of Worker Welfare Fund (WWF) were unlawful. Federal Board of Revenue filed review petition against the subject order, which is currently pending for adjudication.

WWF provision from 2014 has been maintained conservatively based on tax advisor’s opinion in view of provincial levy of WWF by the provinces with effect from 2014, including levy by Sindh which is under litigation.

Punjab Government promulgated Punjab Workers Welfare Fund Act 2019 (PWWF) with effect from December 13, 2019, therefore, provision related to Punjab and pertaining to the period from 2014 till the date of promulgation of PWWF was reversed.

|23.3.2|The income tax assessments of the Bank have been finalized up to and including tax year 2024 for local, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan operations. While finalizing income tax assessments up to tax year 2024 income tax authorities made certain add backs with aggregate tax impact of Rs. 38,524 million (2023: 34,841 million). As a result of appeals filed by the Bank before appellate authorities, most of the add backs have been deleted. However, the Bank and Tax Department are in appeals/references before higher forums against unfavorable decisions. Pending finalization of appeals/references no provision has been made by the Bank on aggregate sum of Rs. 38,524 million (2023: 34,841 million). The management is confident that the outcome of these appeals/references will be in favor of the Bank.|

# Equity Futures

An equity futures contract is a standardized contract, traded on a futures counter of the stock exchange, to buy or sell a certain underlying script at a certain date in the future, at a specified price. The Bank may use equity futures as a hedging instrument to hedge its equity portfolio, in both ‘held-for-trading’ and ‘available-for-sale’, against equity price risk. Only selected shares are allowed to be traded on futures exchange. Equity futures give flexibility to the Bank either to take delivery on the future settlement date or to settle it by adjusting the notional value of the contract based on the current market rates. Maximum exposure limit to the equity futures is 10% of Tier I Capital of the Bank, based on prevailing SBP regulations. The accounting policies used to recognize and disclose derivatives are given in Note 4.16.2. The risk management framework of derivative instruments is given in note 44.

The above sensitivity analysis are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied when calculating the defined benefit obligation recognized within the statement of financial position.

# 37.16 Funding Policy

The Bank endeavors to ensure that liabilities under the various employee benefit schemes are covered by the Fund on any valuation date having regards to the various actuarial assumptions such as projected future salary increase, expected future contributions to the fund, projected increase in liability associated with future service and the projected investment income of the Fund.

# 37.17 Risk associated with defined benefit plans

The defined benefit plans may expose the bank to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, investment risk, salary increase risk and withdrawal rate risk as described below;

# Longevity risks:

The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population.

# Investment risks:

The risk arises when the actual performance level of investment levels is lower than expectation and thus creating a shortfall in the funding objectives.

# Salary increase risk:

The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the final benefit is linked with final salary. The risk arises when the actual increases are higher than expectations and impact the liability accordingly.

# Withdrawal Rate:

The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

# 37.13 Expected contributions to be paid to the funds in the next financial year

The Bank contributes to the gratuity fund as per actuarial expected charge for the next financial year. No contributions are being made to pension due to surplus of fair value of plan’s assets over present value of defined obligation. Based on actuarial advice, management estimates that the charge or (reversal) in respect of defined benefit plans for the year ending December 31, 2025 would be as follows:

|Description|Pension fund|Gratuity fund|Post retirement medical|Employees’ compensated absences|

# 39.4 Deferred cash bonus and remuneration for MRTs for the year 2024 is Rs. 25,827,600 (2023: 23,607,733).

# 40 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# 40.1 Fair value of financial assets

The fair value of traded investments is based on quoted market prices other than those classified as “hold to collect”. Quoted securities classified as hold to collect are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Bank’s accounting policy as stated in note 5.4 to these unconsolidated financial statements.

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# for the year ended December 31, 2024

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

# Level 1:

Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares.

## Chunk 454


# Level 2:

Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance Certificates and Forward Government & Exchange Contracts.

The SBP through its BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 prescribed the minimum paid up capital (net of losses) for all locally incorporated banks of Rs. 10 billion. The paid up capital of the Bank stood at Rs. 11.451 billion as at 31 December, 2024 and is in compliance with the SBP requirements.

Further, SBP vide its BPRD Circular # 6 of 2013 dated August 15, 2013 required the Banks to maintain the minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 12.5% inclusive of Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) of 2.5% on standalone as well as on consolidated basis. To support the banking sector in extending financing or credit facilities to their customers during COVID-19, SBP vide BPRD Circular # 12 of 2020 relaxed the CAR requirement to 11.5% by reducing the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) from 2.5% to 1.5% till further instructions.

# Categories of Risk

Credit Risk This risk is defined as the possibility of loss due to unexpected default or a deterioration of credit worthiness of a business partner.

Credit Risk includes Country Risk i.e., the risks that counterparty is unable to meet its foreign currency obligations as a result of adverse economic conditions or actions taken by governments in the relevant country.

Market Risk The risk that the value of on and off-balance sheet positions of the Bank will be adversely affected by movements in market rates or prices such as interest rates / rate of returns, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads and / or commodity prices, resulting in a loss to earnings and capital.

Liquidity Risk The risk that the Bank is unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due and to replace funds when they are withdrawn without incurring unacceptable cost or losses.

Operational Risk Operational Risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. The definition includes legal risk but excludes strategic risk and reputational risk.

Reputational Risk The Reputational risk arises from the negative perception on the part of stakeholders that can adversely affect a bank’s ability to maintain existing, or establish new, business relationships and continued access to sources of funding.

Information Security & Governance Risk The Reputational risk arises from the negative perception on the part of stakeholders that can adversely affect a bank’s ability to maintain existing, or establish new, business relationships and continued access to sources of funding.

Strategic Risk Risk of an adverse impact on strategic goals. Strategic risk mainly arises from strategic decisions, improper implementation of those decisions, or lack of responsiveness of Bank to industry, economic or technological changes.

Shariah Non-Compliance Risk Shariah Non Compliance Risk arises from the failure to comply with shariah rules and principles determined by the Shariah Board of the Bank and the Regulator.

# 44.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation. The Bank is exposed to credit risk through its lending and investment activities. The Bank’s credit risk function is divided into Corporate and Financial Institutions and Risk Shariah and Commercial, SME and Consumer Risk. The functions operate within an integrated framework of credit policies, guidelines and processes. The credit risk management activities are governed by the Credit Policy of the Bank that defines the respective roles and responsibilities, the credit risk management principles and the Bank’s credit risk strategy. The policy is supported by a comprehensive Credit Procedures Manual.

The Bank manages three principal sources of credit risk:

1. Sovereign credit risk on its public sector advances
2. Counterparty credit risk on its private sector advances
3. Counterparty credit risk on interbank limits

# Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Bank lends to public sector borrowers, it prefers obtaining a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the Government of Pakistan (GOP). However, certain public sector enterprises have a well-defined cash flow stream and appropriate business model, based on which the lending is secured through collaterals other than GOP guarantee.

# Counterparty credit risk on its private sector advances

Each borrower’s credit worthiness is analyzed on the Credit Application Package that incorporates a formalized and structured approach for credit analysis and directs the focus of evaluation towards a balanced assessment of credit risk with identification of proper mitigants. These risks include Industry Risk, Business Risk, Financial Risk, Security Risk and Account Performance Risk. Financial analysis is further strengthened through use of separate financial spread sheet templates that have been designed for manufacturing / trading concerns, financial institutions and insurance companies.

# Counter Party Credit Risk on Interbank Limits

In the normal course of its business, the Bank’s Treasury utilizes products such as Reverse Repo and Call Lending to meet the needs of interbank borrowers and manage its exposure to fluctuations in market, interest and currency rates. Further, these products are also used to temporarily invest Bank’s liquidity prior to disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty in the transaction may be unable to meet its obligation to the Bank. Reflecting a preference for minimizing exposure to counterparty credit risk, the Bank maintains eligibility criteria that link the exposure limits to counterparty credit ratings by external rating agencies.

# A. Country Risk

The Bank has in place a Country Risk Management Framework which has been approved by the Board. This framework focuses on providing detailed roles and responsibilities with respect to country risk assessment as well as limit setting, exposure management and reporting of cross border exposure undertaken by the Bank. The Bank utilizes S&P, Fitch and Moody’s country ratings as well as other macroeconomic and external risk factors in assigning a country risk limit.

# 44.1.6 Advances – Province/Region–wise Disbursement and Utilization

# 44.2 Market Risk

Market Risk is the risk of loss in earnings and capital due to adverse changes in interest rates / rate of return, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and market conditions. Thus market risk can be further described into Interest Rate Risk / Rate of Return Risk, Foreign Exchange Risk and Equity Position Risk.

Market Risk performs risk measurement, monitoring and control functions through the use of various risk procedures and models. To give it a formal structure, all the policies and guidelines are approved by the Board of Directors and the relevant management committees.

The Bank uses three types of risk management tools to measure the Bank’s Market Risk: Value-at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES) and Stress Testing. In addition, control limits are utilized to maintain the risks within acceptable levels.

The Bank maintains adequate regulatory capital to cover all interest rate risks falling under the “Trading Book” as well as “Banking Book”, as defined by Basel capital accord. The Bank uses Standardized Approach in determining credit risk, market risk and operational risk exposures in the capital adequacy calculation. In Market risk exposures, Maturity method is used to calculate charge on Interest rate risk and FX risk.

In its pursuit of automation, the Bank has successfully implemented Oracle Financial Services Analytical Application (OFSAA) Market Risk Module to automate the risk monitoring and reporting activities pertaining to Market Risk, which allows for more efficient risk monitoring and increased focus on risk analysis to help in making more informed decisions.

# 44.2.3 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in currency exchange rates.

The majority of the Bank’s net foreign currency exposure is in US$ and the Bank uses system-based monitoring of its intra-day Net Open Position for effective risk management.

The Bank’s FX Risk is largely mitigated by following a matched funding policy, whereas, for any mismatched exposures, the Bank utilizes appropriate derivative instruments such as Forwards and Swaps. The Bank maintains adequate regulatory capital to cover against foreign exchange risk.

# 44.2.5 Yield and Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)-Basel II Specific

Interest rate and Rate of return risk is the current or prospective risk of losses, to both the Bank’s capital and earnings, arising from movements in interest rates and rates of return. The Bank has a robust system in place to monitor Interest rate risk and ALCO regularly analyses the interest rate scenario and devises strategies to minimize adverse impact of interest rate risk on the Bank’s equity and profits.

Interest rate risk is measured through “duration” of an instrument. To assess the interest rate risk at Balance Sheet and Income Statement level, gap analysis on “re-pricing schedule” is utilized.

# Operational Risk

The Bank, like all financial institutions, is exposed to different types of operational risks, including the potential losses arising from internal activities or external events caused by breakdowns in information, communication, physical safeguards, business continuity, supervision, transaction processing, settlement systems and the execution of legal, fiduciary and agency responsibilities.

In accordance with the BoD approved Operational Risk Management Policy (ORM), Bank maintains a system of internal controls designed to keep operational risk at appropriate levels, in view of the bank’s financial strength and the characteristics of the activities and market in which it operates. These internal controls are periodically updated to conform to industry best practices.

The Bank has implemented workflow based system “Risk Nucleus” for Operational Risk Loss Data Collection & Reporting, Risk Control & Self Assessment (RCSA) and Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) monitoring. Further, major Operational Risk events are also analyzed from the control breaches perspective and mitigating controls are assessed on design and operating effectiveness.

Quarterly updates on Operational Risk events are presented to senior management and Board’s Risk Management Committee & BoD.

# Liquidity Risk

Liquidity Risk is the risk that the Bank is unable to fund its current obligations and operations in the most cost efficient manner. The Bank’s Board of Directors has delegated the responsibility to Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) for ensuring that Bank’s policy for liquidity management is adhered to on a continual basis. ALCO uses gap analysis based on “maturity schedule” to assess the Bank’s liquidity risk and devise strategy accordingly.

The Bank has in place a robust Recovery Plan in place to deal with any liquidity crisis in the most efficient and effective manner. SBP initiatives such as deferral of principal and rescheduling and restructuring of loans may have an adverse effect on liquidity and maturity profile of the Bank, however the Bank holds sufficient liquidity buffer to absorb any unforeseen shocks during the prevailing situation.

# Key Audit Matter

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. This matter was addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

|Key Audit Matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|
|Expected credit loss against advances|As disclosed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group’s advances represent 37.26% of its total assets as of 31 December 2024. We applied a range of audit procedures including the following: the Group’s accounting policy and ECL model methodology adopted during the year.|

During the year, the Group has adopted IFRS 9 - “Financial Instruments” (as applicable in Pakistan), which requires a forward-looking approach to estimate the Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”) against advances and other financial instruments. The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in a transition adjustment to the retained earnings as of 1 January 2024 of Rs. 4,035 million. The impact of transition is explained in Note 4.2.4 and 4.2.5 to the consolidated financial statements.

In view of the significance of this area in terms of its impact on the consolidated financial statements, and level of involvement of management’s estimates and judgments, we identified adequacy and completeness of ECL against advances as a key audit matter.

The accounting policy and disclosures related to the ECL against advances are included in Notes 4.2 and 9 respectively to the consolidated financial statements. We also assessed adequacy of disclosures as included in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements regarding the ECL made against advances in accordance with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework.

# Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# for the year ended December 31, 2024

The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Bank’s financial statements.

in IFRS 4, which are largely based on grandfathering previous local accounting policies, IFRS 17 provides a comprehensive model for insurance contracts, covering all relevant accounting aspects. The core of IFRS 17 is the general model, supplemented by:

- A specific adaptation for contracts with direct participation features (the variable fee approach)
- A simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) mainly for short-duration contracts.

IFRS 17 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, with comparative figures required. Early application is permitted, provided the entity also applies IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on or before the date it first applies IFRS 17. This standard is not applicable to the Bank.

# IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Consolidated financial statements and Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (amendment)

On 11 September 2014, the IASB issued Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28). The amendments address the conflict between IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures in dealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is sold or contributed to an associate or joint venture. The amendments clarify that a full gain or loss is recognised when a transfer to an associate or joint venture involves a business as defined in IFRS 3 Business combinations. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale or contribution of assets that does not constitute a business, however, is recognised only to the extent of unrelated investors’ interests in the associate or joint venture.

With respect to the amendments on the derecognition of financial liabilities that are settled through an electronic payment system, the Company/Group is currently performing an assessment of all material electronic payment systems it uses, in order to assess whether the amendments will result in a material change with respect to current practices and whether it meets the conditions to apply the accounting policy option to derecognise such financial liabilities before the settlement date. Moreover, the Company/Group is reviewing all its other payment systems (such as cheques, credit cards, debit cards) to ensure that the corresponding financial assets are derecognised when the right to cash flows are extinguished and that the corresponding financial liabilities are derecognised on settlement date.

In December 2015, the IASB decided to defer the effective date of the amendments until such time as it has finalised any amendments that result from its research project on the equity method. Early application of the amendments is still permitted.

Further, IASB has issued annual improvements in IFRS in July 2024, wherein certain amendments have been made to various standards which are effective for annual periods beginning on and after 01 January 2026. The Group is currently evaluating the impact of these recently announced improvements.

# IAS 7 - adjustments resulting from adoption of IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements

In April 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 18, which replaces IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. IFRS 18 is however still to be notified by Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan. Narrow-scope amendments have also been made to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows, which include changing the starting point for determining cash flows from operations under the indirect method, from ‘profit or loss’ to ‘operating profit or loss’ and removing the optionality around classification of cash flows from dividends and interest. In addition, there are consequential amendments to several other standards.

IFRS 18, and the amendments to the other standards, is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027, but earlier application is permitted and must be disclosed. IFRS 18 will apply retrospectively. Upon adoption SECP may, however, prescribe a different effective date.

The Group is currently working to identify all impacts the amendments will have on the primary financial statements and notes to the financial statements.

# 2.4 Critical Accounting Estimates And Judgments

The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with the approved accounting standards requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. It also requires the management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Bank’s accounting policies. Estimates, underlying assumptions and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which estimates are revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The areas where various assumptions and estimates are significant to the Bank’s financial statements or where judgment was exercised in application of accounting policies are as follows:

# 2.4.4 Classification of investments

Debt Securities

- In classifying investments under Amortized Cost, the Group determines the business model of the securities as “Hold to Collect” where the intentions are to hold the security until maturity to collect contractual cash flows based solely on payments of principal and interest. However, the sale of securities under this model is still possible under certain circumstances.
- In classifying investments as “Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income”, the Group determines the business model as Hold to Collect and Sell as the intentions are to hold the asset to collect contractual cash flows based solely on payments of principal and interest and sell the asset to manage liquidity needs or in order to maintain a particular interest yield profile or to match the duration of the assets to the duration of the liabilities that those assets are funding.
- The investments which are not classified as “Amortized Cost” and “Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income” are classified as “Fair Value Through Profit and Loss”. The business model for such investments is to realize the cash flows through the sale of assets (Held for Trading).

# 2.4.5 Depreciation, amortization and revaluation of operating fixed assets

In making estimates of depreciation and amortization, the management uses method which reflects the pattern in which economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Group and estimates the useful life. The method applied and useful lives estimated are reviewed at each financial year end and if there is a change in the expected pattern or timing of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the assets, the estimate would be changed to reflect the change in pattern. Such a change is accounted for as change in accounting estimates in accordance with International Accounting Standard 8 - Accounting Policies, ‘Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’. Further, the Group estimates the revalued amount of land and buildings on a regular basis. The estimates are based on the valuations carried out by independent professional valuers under the market conditions.

- a) Level 1: These are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at the measurement date.
- b) Level 2: These are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

# 4.2.2 Significant differences from accounting policies applicable till December 31, 2023 before adoption of IFRS 9

# 4.2.2.1 Classification of financial assets

IFRS 9 introduced a new classification model for financial assets that is more principle-based than the previous requirements. Financial assets are classified according to their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business models under which they are held. Instruments will be classified either at amortised cost, the newly established measurement category fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). For equity investment that are not held for trading, an election is available to the Group to classify these either through FVTPL or FVOCI. The previous accounting policies were based on instrument by instrument classification into Held for trading, Held to maturity and Available for Sale categories as disclosed in Note 4.3 to the annual financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 4.2.2.2 Impairment of debt investments and loans and advances

The new IFRS 9 impairment requirements eliminate the previous approach for the recognition of credit losses, i.e., it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. Instead, an entity always accounts for ECLs, and updates the loss allowance for changes in these ECLs at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition. Consequently, the holder of the financial asset needs to take into account more timely and forward-looking information in order to provide users of financial statements with meaningful information about the ECLs on financial instruments that are in the scope of these impairment requirements. The previous impairment requirements were based solely on Prudential regulations of SBP as disclosed in Note 4.11 to the annual financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 4.2.2.3 Impairment of equity investments

Previously, investments classified as available for sale were required to be tested for impairment and if there is an objective evidence, impairment was required to be booked. Under IFRS 9 regime, no impairment is required against such investments which are carried at FVOCI as the gain or loss on remeasurement will permanently remain in OCI/Surplus on revaluation of Investments. The previous accounting policies are disclosed in Note 4.3 & 4.11 to the annual financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 4.2.3.1 Financial assets – initial recognition

Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value, plus in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. When the transaction price of the instrument differs from the fair value at origination and the fair value is based on a valuation technique using only inputs observable in market transactions, the Group recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value in profit and loss account. In those cases where fair value is based on models for which some of the inputs are not observable, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value is deferred and is only recognised in profit and loss account when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

# 4.2.3.4 Debt instruments at FVOCI

The Group applies this new category under IFRS 9 when both of the following conditions are met:

- The instrument is held within a business model, the objective of which is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
- The contractual terms of the financial asset meet the SPPI test

FVOCI debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising due to changes in fair value recognised in OCI. Interest income at EIR and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account.

# 4.2.3.5 Equity instruments at FVOCI

Upon initial recognition, the Group elects to classify its equity investments at FVOCI which are not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable.

# 4.2.3.6 Financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL

Financial assets and financial liabilities in this category are those that are:

- held for trading, that is, they have been purchased or issued primarily for short-term profit-making through trading activities or form part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together, for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit taking, or
- not held for trading and have been either designated by management upon initial recognition, or mandatorily required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9.

Financial assets are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in profit and loss account. Interest and dividend income or expense is recorded in net trading income according to the terms of the contract, or when the right to payment has been established.

# 4.2.3.7 Financial liabilities at amortised cost

Financial liabilities with a fixed maturity are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. These include Bills payable, Borrowings, Deposits and certain items within Other Liabilities.

# 4.2.3.8 Derecognition of financial assets

# 4.2.3.8.1 Derecognition due to substantial modification of terms and conditions

The Group derecognises a financial asset, such as a loan to a customer, when the terms and conditions have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new loan, with the difference recognised as a derecognition gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The newly recognised loan is classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes, unless it is deemed to be purchased originated credit impaired.

If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different, the modification does not result in derecognition. Based on the change in cash flows discounted at the original EIR, the Group records a modification gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded.

The gain/(loss) on derecognition of financial asset is calculated as the difference between the book value (including impairment) and the proceeds received.

# 4.2.3.10 Impairment of financial assets

# 4.2.3.10.1 Overview of the ECL principles

The adoption of IFRS 9 has fundamentally changed the Bank’s loan loss impairment method by replacing the incurred loss approach of the local regulations with a forward-looking ECL approach. The Group has been recording the allowance for expected credit losses for all loans and other debt financial assets held at amortized cost or FVOCI, together with loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantee contracts. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under IFRS 9. Under the SBP’s instructions, local currency credit exposures guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL.

The interest rate used to discount the ECLs would be based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities.

When estimating the ECLs, the Group considers three probability-weighted scenarios (a base case, a best case, and a worse case). Each of these is associated with different PDs, EADs and LGDs. These expected probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. This calculation is made for each of the three scenarios. When relevant, the assessment of multiple scenarios also incorporates how defaulted loans are expected to be recovered, including the probability that the loans will cure and the value of collateral or the amount that might be received for selling the asset.

The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Group has the legal right to call it earlier.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# for the year ended December 31, 2024

Impairment losses and reversals are accounted for and disclosed separately from modification losses or gains that are accounted for as an adjustment of the financial asset’s gross carrying value.

# Impact on regulatory capital

The implementation of IFRS 9 has led to a decrease in the regulatory capital of banks, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has concluded that it may be suitable for banks to establish a transitional arrangement regarding the impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the Application Instructions issued by the SBP outlines this transitional arrangement. This arrangement specifically pertains to provisions for Stage 1 and Stage 2 financial assets. It requires adjustments to Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. If there is a decrease in CET1 capital due to new provisions, after accounting for tax effects, upon the adoption of an ECL accounting model, the reduction in CET1 capital (referred to as the “transitional adjustment amount”) must be partially reinstated (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over a “transition period” of five years.

Additionally, the SBP has permitted adjustments to the amounts of Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions in Tier 2 Capital that have not been added back to CET1, and vice versa, as specified in Annexure A of BPRD Circular No. 16 of 2024, dated July 29, 2024. The Group has not elected to utilize the IFRS 9 transitional arrangement.

# 4.2.6

The following explains how applying the new classification requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Group as shown in the table above:

(a) Open ended mutual funds previously classified as available for sale (AFS) has been reclassified to FVTPL

The Group holds a portfolio of mutual funds investments which was earlier classified as available for sale (AFS) investments. However, these investments do not meet the definition of equity investment from holders perspective, therefore IFRS 9 classification requirements of debt instruments have been applied to these financial assets. The business model of this portfolio is hold to collect and sell, however contractual cash flows failed to meet the ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ (SPPI) test requirement for classification as FVOCI under IFRS 9. Therefore, these financial assets having a carrying value of Rs. 34.454 million have been reclassified mandatorily as FVTPL.

(b) Debt investments previously classified as available for sale (AFS) reclassified to amortised cost

At the date of initial application of IFRS 9, an entity shall assess the business model and the contractual terms of the financial asset on the basis of facts and circumstances that exist at the transition date. The Group has identified certain portfolio of federal government securities under AFS category which have been held to collect the contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. As a result, financial assets having fair value amounting to Rs. 104,223.092 million have been reclassified to Amortized cost at Rs. 120,334.806 million, instead of FVOCI.

(c) Investment in debt securities previously designated at held for trading

The Group holds investment of Rs. 20,049.848 million in a portfolio of debt securities which had previously been designated at held for trading as the debt securities were managed on a fair value basis. As part of the transition to IFRS 9, these securities are part of an ‘other’ business model and so required to be classified as FVTPL category under IFRS 9.

(d) Designation of equity instruments at FVOCI

In addition to the above, the following debt instruments have been reclassified to new categories under IFRS 9, as their previous categories under existing local regulations were ‘retired’, with no changes to their measurement basis:

(e) Reclassification from retired categories with no change in measurement

In addition to the above, the following debt instruments have been reclassified to new categories under IFRS 9, as their previous categories under existing local regulations were ‘retired’, with no changes to their measurement basis:

- Those previously classified as available for sale and now classified as measured at FVOCI;
- Those previously classified as held to maturity and now classified as measured at amortised cost.
- Those previously classified as held for trading and now classified as measured at FVTPL.

- a) Sale under re-purchase agreements
- Securities sold subject to a re-purchase agreement are retained in the financial statements as investments and the counter party liability is included in borrowings from financial institutions. The differential in sale and re-purchase value is accrued on a prorata basis and recorded as mark-up expense.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# for the year ended December 31, 2024

Securities held as collateral are not recognized in the financial statements, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability under borrowings from financial institutions. All “regular way” purchases and sales of investments are recognized on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of investments that require settlement within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

In Bai Muajjal, the Group purchases and sells Shariah Compliant instruments including sukuks on credit to other financial institutions. The credit price is agreed at the time of sale and such proceeds are received at the end of the credit period. Expected profit / expense is recognized on accrual basis.

In Musharaka and Mudaraba, the Group invests in the Shariah compliant business pools of the financial institutions at the agreed profit and loss sharing ratio. Expected profit is recognized on accrual basis.

Other borrowings including borrowings from SBP are recorded at the proceeds received. Mark-up on such borrowings is charged to the Profit and Loss Account on a time proportion basis.

Lendings are stated net of provision. Return on such lending is accrued to the Profit and Loss Account on a time proportion basis except mark-up on impaired or delinquent lendings, which is recognized on receipt basis.

# Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income

These are debt investments which are acquired under the business model “Hold to Collect and Sell” where the intentions are to collect contractual cash flows and sell the asset to manage everyday liquidity needs, to maintain a particular interest yield profile or to match the duration of the assets to the duration of the liabilities that those assets are funding. The contractual cash flows are based solely on payments of principal and interest (SPPI). In addition, equity investments which are not held for trading are classified under this category.

# Fair Value Through Profit and Loss

The investments, other than those in subsidiary, which are not classified as Amortized Cost and Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income are classified as Fair Value Through Profit and Loss. The business model for such investments is to realize the cash flows through the sale of assets (Held for Trading) or the contractual cash flows of the debt instruments are not solely payments of principal and interest.

Investments are initially recognized at fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.

Quoted securities, other than those classified as “amortized cost” and investments in subsidiaries, are carried at market value. Debt securities classified as “amortized cost” are subsequently measured at amortized cost.

Unrealized surplus or (deficit) arising on revaluation of the Bank’s “Fair Value Through Profit and Loss” investment portfolio is taken to the profit and loss account. Surplus or (deficit) arising on revaluation of debt securities classified as “Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income” is kept in a separate account shown in the statement of financial position as a component of Equity. On derecognition, the cumulative gains or losses previously recognized in Other Comprehensive Income is reclassified to Profit and Loss Account. The surplus or (deficit) arising on equity securities designated as “Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income” is taken to Other Comprehensive Income. Upon disposal, the cumulative surplus or (deficit) previously recognized in Other Comprehensive Income is reclassified from equity to Unappropriated Profit as a reclassification adjustment and is never recycled to Profit and Loss Account.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# for the year ended December 31, 2024

An item of property and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is recognized in the Profit and Loss Account in the year the asset is derecognized, except that the related surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of deferred tax) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the Profit and Loss Account.

# 4.10 Staff retirement and other benefits

# 4.10.1 Staff retirement schemes

a) For employees who opted for the 2002 scheme introduced by the management

An approved pension scheme (defined benefit scheme) under which the benefits on the basis of frozen basic salary, service length and age as on June 30, 2002 are payable to all employees whose date of joining the Group is on or before July 01, 1992, i.e., who have completed ten years of continuous service as on June 30, 2002.

An approved gratuity scheme (defined benefit scheme) under which the benefits are payable as under:

i. For members whose date of joining the Group is on or before July 01, 1992, their services would be calculated starting from July 01, 2002 for gratuity benefit purposes.

ii. For members whose date of joining the Group is after July 01, 1992 their services would be taken at actual for the purpose of calculating the gratuity benefit. This rule will be applicable upon retirement or in service death only, in case of resignation gratuity will be payable from July 01, 2002, even if he or she had joined the Group before July 01, 2002.

b) Intangible assets

Intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any. The cost of intangible assets is amortized over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method. Amortization is charged from the month the assets are available for use at the rate stated in note 11.2. The useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.

c) Capital work-in-progress

Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any.

# 4.8 Lease liability and right of use asset

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the Banks’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The carrying amount is remeasured/adjusted if there are changes in the future cash flows or the lease term.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date. On subsequent measurement, right-of-use assets are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses and are adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term as this method closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits. Carrying amount of the lease liability is derecognised upon termination of the lease contract with corresponding adjustment to right-of-use asset. Gain or loss on termination of lease contract is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.

The Group has elected not to recognize a right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense in the Profit or Loss Account on a straight-line basis.

# 4.9 Taxation

a) Current

Provision for current taxation is based on taxable income for the year determined in accordance with the prevailing laws for taxation. The charge for current tax is calculated using the prevailing tax rates or tax rates expected to apply to the profits for the year.

b) Prior

The taxation charge for prior years represents adjustments to the tax charge relating to prior years, arising from assessments or changes in laws and changes in estimates made during the current year.

c) Deferred

Deferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences, at the reporting date between the amounts attributed to assets and liabilities for financial reporting purpose and amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply to the periods when the difference will reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

The Group also recognizes a deferred tax asset or liability on deficit or surplus on revaluation of fixed assets, non-banking assets and investments which is adjusted against the related deficit or surplus in accordance with the requirements of IAS-12 ‘Income Taxes’.

# 4.10.2 Other long term benefit

a) Employees’ compensated absences

Employees’ entitlement to annual leave is recognized when they accrue to employees, up to a maximum of 60 days. A provision is made for estimated liability for annual leaves as a result of services rendered by the employee against un-availed leaves, as per terms of service contract, up to the reporting date, based on actuarial valuation using Projected Unit Credit Method. Actuarial gains or losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in Profit and Loss Account in the period of occurrence.

b) Compensation to certain class of employees

Group has revised its retirement policy by reducing the retirement age to 58 years for class of employees effective January 01, 2018.

# 4.11 Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

Non-banking assets (NBA) acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation (excluding land). Revaluation by independent professionally qualified valuers, is carried out with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. Surplus arising on revaluation of NBA is credited to the ‘surplus on revaluation of assets’ account through statement of comprehensive income and any deficit arising on revaluation is taken to Profit and Loss Account directly. Legal fees, transfer costs and direct costs of acquiring title to property are charged to Profit and Loss Account and not capitalised.

# 4.13 Impairment

# a) Financial assets

Expected credit loss is measured for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at fair value through Profit and Loss, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment. Determination of expected credit losses is a significant estimate and involves the following judgments:

- Development of ECL models, including the various formulas and the choice of inputs.
- The segmentation of financial assets when their ECL is assessed on a collective basis.
- The Bank’s internal credit grading model based on which PDs are assigned to the individual grades.
- Qualitative and quantitative indicators used as SICR triggers.
- The definition of default against which parameters of ECL model such as PD, LGD and EAD are evaluated.
- Selection of forward looking macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weightings.
- Determination of economic inputs, such as GDP growth and CPI.

# b) Non-financial assets

The carrying amount of the Bank’s assets (other than deferred tax assets) are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the relevant asset is estimated. An impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the Profit and Loss Account except for an impairment loss on revalued assets which is adjusted against the related revaluation surplus to the extent that the impairment loss does not exceed the revaluation surplus for that same asset. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized.

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provision against identified losses on non-funded exposure is recognized when intimated and reasonable certainty exists for the Group to settle the obligation. The loss is charged to the Profit and Loss Account net of expected recovery and is classified under other liabilities. Provisions are reviewed at the reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.

# 20.2 Workers Welfare Fund

Supreme Court of Pakistan vide order dated November 10, 2016 held that the amendments made in the law through Finance Act 2008, introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of Worker Welfare Fund (WWF) were unlawful. Federal Board of Revenue filed review petition against the subject order, which is currently pending for adjudication. WWF provision from 2014 has been maintained conservatively based on tax advisor’s opinion in view of provincial levy of WWF by the provinces with effect from 2014, including levy by Sindh which is under litigation. Punjab Government promulgated Punjab Workers Welfare Fund Act 2019 (PWWF) with effect from December 13, 2019, therefore, provision related to Punjab and pertaining to the period from 2014 till the date of promulgation of PWWF was reversed.

# Forward Exchange Contracts

Forward Exchange Contract (FEC) is a product which is offered to the obligor who transact internationally. These obligor use this product to hedge themselves from unfavorable movements in a foreign currency, however, by agreeing to fix the exchange rate, they do not benefit from favorable movements in that currency.

An FEC is a contract between the Obligor and the Bank in which both agree to exchange an amount of one currency for another currency at an agreed forward exchange rate for settlement over more than two business days after the FEC is entered into (the day on which settlement occurs is called the value date). FEC is entered with those Obligors whose credit worthiness has already been assessed, and they have underlined trade transactions.

If the relevant exchange rate moves un-favorably, Obligor will benefit from that movement because the Bank must exchange currencies at the FEC rate. In order to mitigate this risk of adverse exchange rate movement, the Bank hedges its exposure by taking opposite forward position in inter-bank FX.

# Foreign Exchange Swaps

A Foreign Exchange Swap (FX Swap) is used by the Bank if it has a need to exchange one currency for another currency on one day and then re-exchange those currencies at a later date. Exchange rates and forward margins are determined in the “inter-bank” market and fluctuate according to supply and demand.

An FX Swap prevents the Bank from gaining any benefit resulting from a favorable exchange rate movement in the relevant currency pair between the time Bank enters into the transaction deal and when settlement occurs. Cancellation of the swap may also result in exposure to market movements. The key advantage of an FX swap is that it provides the Bank with protection.

# Expected contributions to be paid to the funds in the next financial year

The Bank contributes to the gratuity fund as per actuarial expected charge for the next financial year. No contributions are being made to pension due to surplus of fair value of plan’s assets over present value of defined obligation. Based on actuarial advice, management estimates that the charge or (reversal) in respect of defined benefit plans for the year ending December 31, 2025 would be as follows:

| |Pension fund|Gratuity fund|Post retirement medical|Employees’ compensated absences|
|---|---|---|---|---|

# Risk associated with defined benefit plans

The defined benefit plans may expose the bank to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, investment risk, salary increase risk and withdrawal rate risk as described below:

- Longevity risks: The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population.
- Investment risks: The risk arises when the actual performance level of investment levels is lower than expectation and thus creating a shortfall in the funding objectives.
- Salary increase risk: The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the final benefit is linked with final salary. The risk arises when the actual increases are higher than expectations and impact the liability accordingly.
- Withdrawal Rate: The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

# 40 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# 40.1 Fair value of financial assets

The fair value of traded investments is based on quoted market prices other than those classified as “hold to collect”. Quoted securities classified as hold to collect are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Bank’s accounting policy as stated in note 5.4 to these consolidated financial statements.

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance Certificates and Forward Government & Exchange Contracts.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

|Carrying Value| | |Level| | |Total|

# 44.2 Market Risk

Market Risk is the risk of loss in earnings and capital due to adverse changes in interest rates / rate of return, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and market conditions. Thus market risk can be further described into Interest Rate Risk / Rate of Return Risk, Foreign Exchange Risk and Equity Position.

Market Risk performs risk measurement, monitoring and control functions through the use of various risk procedures and models. To give it a formal structure, all the policies and guidelines are approved by the Board of Directors and the relevant management committees.

The Bank uses three types of risk management tools to measure the Bank’s Market Risk: Value-at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES) and Stress Testing. In addition, control limits are utilized to maintain the risks within acceptable levels.

The Bank maintains adequate regulatory capital to cover all interest rate risks falling under the “Trading Book” as well as “Banking Book”, as defined by Basel capital accord. The Bank uses Standardized Approach in determining credit risk, market risk and operational risk exposures in the capital adequacy calculation. In Market risk exposures, Maturity method is used to calculate charge on Interest rate risk and FX risk.

In its pursuit of automation, the Bank has successfully implemented Oracle Financial Services Analytical Application (OFSAA) Market Risk Module to automate the risk monitoring and reporting activities pertaining to Market Risk, which allows for more efficient risk monitoring and increased focus on risk analysis to help in making more informed decisions.

# 44.2.3 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in currency exchange rates.

The majority of the Bank’s net foreign currency exposure is in US$ and the Bank uses system-based monitoring of its intra-day Net Open Position for effective risk management.

The Bank’s FX Risk is largely mitigated by following a matched funding policy, whereas, for any mismatched exposures, the Bank utilizes appropriate derivative instruments such as Forwards and Swaps. The Bank maintains adequate regulatory capital to cover against foreign exchange risk.

# Operational Risk

The Bank, like all financial institutions, is exposed to different types of operational risks, including the potential losses arising from internal activities or external events caused by breakdowns in information, communication, physical safeguards, business continuity, supervision, transaction processing, settlement systems and the execution of legal, fiduciary and agency responsibilities.

In accordance with the BoD approved Operational Risk Management Policy (ORM), Bank maintains a system of internal controls designed to keep operational risk at appropriate levels, in view of the bank’s financial strength and the characteristics of the activities and market in which it operates. These internal controls are periodically updated to conform to industry best practices.

The Bank has implemented workflow based system “Risk Nucleus” for Operational Risk Loss Data Collection & Reporting, Risk Control & Self Assessment (RCSA) and Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) monitoring. Further, major Operational Risk events are also analyzed from the control breaches perspective and mitigating controls are assessed on design and operating effectiveness. Quarterly updates on Operational Risk events are presented to senior management and Board’s Risk Management Committee & BoD.

The Bank has a BoD approved BCP policy and Business Continuity Plan applicable to all its functional areas. The Bank updates functional BCPs on annual basis or at any process change.

# Liquidity Risk

Liquidity Risk is the risk that the Bank is unable to fund its current obligations and operations in the most cost efficient manner. The Bank’s Board of Directors has delegated the responsibility to Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) for ensuring that Bank’s policy for liquidity management is adhered to on a continual basis. ALCO uses gap analysis based on “maturity schedule” to assess the Bank’s liquidity risk and devise strategy accordingly.

The Bank has various limits and triggers in place to monitor liquidity risk on a periodic basis, while it also utilizes stress testing to assess adequacy of Bank’s liquid assets. The Bank complies with State Bank of Pakistan’s instructions on Liquidity Standards as prescribed under the Basel III Framework.

Daily liquidity management is carried out centrally by the Asset and Liability Management (ALM) Desk in Treasury Group which manages the day to day liquidity needs of the Bank. Funding and liquidity management strategies are regularly discussed during Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) meetings. The discussions include analysis on composition of deposits and tenure, funding gaps and concentration, monitoring of short and long-term liquidity ratios (including Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio).

The Bank utilizes internal Management Action Triggers and Limits which act as early warning indicators and safeguards to ensure sufficient liquidity buffers at all times. Additionally, stress tests are performed to evaluate available liquidity under a range of adverse scenarios and to identify potential vulnerabilities in portfolios. The Bank also has in place contingency funding plan that identifies specific management actions that can be invoked in times of liquidity crisis.

# Liquidity Risk Management

The Bank has in place a robust Recovery Plan in place to deal with any liquidity crisis in the most efficient and effective manner. SBP initiatives such as deferral of principal and rescheduling and restructuring of loans may have an adverse effect on liquidity and maturity profile of the Bank, however the Bank holds sufficient liquidity buffer to absorb any unforeseen shocks during the prevailing situation.

Moreover, the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) of the Bank continues to regularly monitor the liquidity position of the Bank in view of emerging risks.

# Liquidity Risk Mitigation Techniques

The Group uses the following tools to identify and mitigate Liquidity Risk:

- Gap Analysis
- Liquidity Ratios
- Liquidity Stress Testing
- Contingency Funding Plan
- Risk Control Limits (RCLs)
