# Economy:

The latest economic indicators depict a moderate pick‑up in activity on the back of better prospects for agriculture, notable improvement in current account, external inflows including IMF SBA tranche and improved confidence despite tight monetary and fiscal policy and continued import management. However, macroeconomic risks remain high amid a large debt burden and limited foreign exchange reserves.

Inflation has begun to decelerate in line with expectations, though the levels remain high and the outlook is susceptible to risks contingent upon targeted fiscal consolidation, timely realization of external inflows and the trends of commodity prices in view of continued geopolitical tensions. Given the uncertainty regarding the inflation outlook, key central banks in both advanced and emerging economies have continued to maintain a cautious monetary policy stance. SBP MPC’s recent announcement is also reflecting a cautious approach as the policy rate was kept unchanged at 22 percent.

On the external front, current account posted a deficit of USD 1.0 billion for the eight months of current fiscal year against USD 3.9 billion for the same period last year reflecting an improvement in trade balance. Trade deficit for the current period at USD 13.5 billion compares with USD 18.7 billion last year as both import and exports are showing positive variances. Remittances recorded a marginal decline for the current fiscal year; however, the trend is expected to improve due to eid and seasonal factor.

Looking ahead, Pakistan’s GDP growth is expected to remain below potential at around 1.8 percent for the current fiscal year ending June 2024 as recent indicators remain fragile due to persistent inflation and elevated interest rates. The structural reforms needed to improve the economic outlook demand a clearly articulated implementation plan that is credible and targets quick progress as an imperative to restore confidence. Improved fiscal management remains pivotal to address inflation, narrow the current account deficit, improve financial sector.

# Financial Performance:

The financial results of the Bank for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024 are summarized as under:

| |Three months ended March 31,|2024|2023|
|---|---|---|---|
|Net mark‑up and non fund income| |16,627|15,076|
|Administrative and other expenses| |(8,114)|(6,783)|
|Operating profit| |8,513|8,294|
|Credit loss allowance / provisions and write offs ‑ net| |(1,174)|58|
|Profit before taxation| |7,339|8,352|
|Taxation| |(3,624)|(3,648)|
|Profit after taxation| |3,715|4,703|
|Basic earnings per share ‑ Rupees| |2.56|3.25|

Profit before provisions for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 at Rs.8.5 billion is showing an increase of 3 percent year‑on‑year. Profit before taxation is showing a decline of 12 percent mainly due to increase in credit loss allowance / provisions against non‑performing assets. Profit after taxation declined by 21 due to a higher taxation rate in comparison with the corresponding period last year. The earnings per share at Rs.2.56 for the current period compares with Rs.3.25 for last year.

Net aggregate revenues increased by 10 percent over the same period last year mainly contributed by mark‑up income which grew by 8 percent to Rs.12.9 billion. The increase in mark‑up income was mainly driven by growth in earning assets partially offset by changes in market rates adversely impacting net spreads for the current quarter. Aggregate non‑markup income increased by 20 percent year‑on‑year; mainly contributed by gains from investment and foreign exchange income. Operating expenses for the current quarter increased by 20 mainly due to the effect of inflation and Rupee devaluation, and also due to additional costs of 60 new branches added to the nation‑wide network during the last twelve months. The Bank continues to manage costs prudently while investing in technologies and infrastructure to support revenue streams.

The Bank’s deposits closed at Rs.1.3 trillion at March 31, 2024 with current and saving accounts constituting 84 percent of the total deposit at period end. Advances registered a growth of 8.6 percent during the quarter, from Rs. 633 billion at year end 2023 to Rs 687 billion. The economic stress on certain borrowers warranted additional classifications. Accordingly, a net provision of Rs.1.17 billion has been charged against the profit for the

# Quarter in Review

During the quarter, the Bank has adopted IFRS9 as per regulatory guidance and requisite financial disclosures have been made in the annexed financial statements. The Bank’s entity rating was reaffirmed at ‘AA+’ (Double A Plus) for the long‑term by Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA), with outlook assigned as ‘Stable’. The Bank’s strong brand and affiliation with Fauji Foundation are recognized as the key rating drivers, supported by Bank's experienced management team, prudent risk management policies, and deep‑rooted relationship with clients. Lately, retention of profits in the bank to bolster the capital structure is also a testimonial of support. The short‑term rating was maintained at ‘A1+’ (A One Plus).

Askari Bank is strategically positioned for sustainable growth and remains committed towards building long‑term shareholder value, despite macroeconomic challenges. Risk management will remain the key across all lines of businesses and the strategies will focus on being risk aware and not risk wary as challenges remain largely weighed to the downside. The Bank is expanding its footprint, to grow market share in retail segment, particularly low‑cost and saving deposits. The Bank will continue to pursue strong governance and compliance discipline. Customer experience remains a key priority aided by continued initiatives in the areas of process improvements, digitization, automation and data analytics. To this end, the Bank will continue to invest in talent and technology enabling its teams to do more to help our customers achieve their ambitions and in‑turn drive Askari Bank to grow in the future.

# 36. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair values of traded investments are based on quoted market prices. The fair values of unquoted equity investments are estimated using the break-up value of the investee company. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term advances, fixed term deposits and borrowings, other assets and other liabilities cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings, are frequently repriced.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in these unconsolidated financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

# 36.1 Fair value of financial assets

Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets (Pakistan Stock Exchange) for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) available at MUFAP and Reuters page.

Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2 and level 3

|Federal Government Securities|The fair values of Federal Government Securities are determined on the basis of rates / prices sourced from Reuters.|
|---|---|
|Non Government Debt Securities|Non Government Debt Securities are valued on the basis of rates announced by Mutual Fund Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).|
|Foreign Government Debt Securities|Foreign Government Debt Securities are valued on the basis of rates taken from custodian of the securities which are usually drawn from Bloomberg.|
|Unit of Mutual Funds|Fair values of mutual funds are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of reporting period.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions|The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.|
|Fixed Assets and Non Banking Assets Acquired in Satisfaction of Claims|Land and Non Banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are valued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessments of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.|

# 36. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair values of traded investments are based on quoted market prices. The fair values of unquoted equity investments are estimated using the break-up value of the investee company. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term advances, fixed term deposits and borrowings, other assets and other liabilities cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings, are frequently repriced.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in these consolidated financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2 and level 3

|Federal Government Securities|The fair values of Federal Government Securities are determined on the basis of rates / prices sourced from Reuters.|
|---|---|
|Non Government Debt Securities|Non Government Debt Securities are valued on the basis of rates announced by Mutual Fund Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).|
|Foreign Government Debt Securities|Foreign Government Debt Securities are valued on the basis of rates taken from custodian of the securities which are usually drawn from Bloomberg.|
|Unit of Mutual Funds|Fair values of mutual funds are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of reporting period.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions|The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.|
|Fixed Assets and Non Banking Assets Acquired in Satisfaction of Claims|Land and Non Banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are valued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessments of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.|
