# Economy Snapshot

Pakistan’s economy is expected to see a modest recovery in FY24, with growth projected between 2% and 3%. This growth is primarily driven by improvements in the agricultural sector, benefiting from better crop yields and practices. However, external factors such as weather patterns and global commodity prices need close monitoring to ensure sustained growth.

Inflation remains a concern, though recent data shows positive trend. Headline inflation dropped to 20.68% in March 2024 from 23.1% in February 2024. However, core inflation remains high. The central bank aims to bring inflation within the target range of 5 – 7% by September 2025 through adjustments in monetary policy and supply-side measures as outlined in an IMF agreement.

The recent IMF agreement, providing an additional US$1.1 billion in support, acknowledging the positive steps taken by the government and the central bank. The target areas for reform highlighted in the agreement include fiscal discipline, addressing circular debt in the energy sector, and promoting a transparent foreign exchange market.

Discussions on a potential successor program with the IMF are expected to begin, focusing on addressing structural weaknesses and promoting sustained economic growth. This entails strengthening public finances, promoting private sector investment and improving the business environment to generate jobs and foster long-term growth. Successful implementation of these reforms will be crucial for Pakistan’s economic stability and growth.

The Bank’s deposit book experienced a substantial increase of 20.8% compared to the period ended March 31, 2023. However, there was a decrease of 4.9% when compared with figures reported as at December 31, 2023. This decrease is mainly attributable to customer withdrawals from current account, due to which current account witnessed decline by 10.6% when compared with December 31, 2023. The management is focused to recover its position in current and saving accounts (CASA) by garnering trade finance business, employee banking and cash management mandates. The Bank has made a substantial progress in securing new mandates and uplift trade volumes, and as soon as these would materialize, it will have a positive impact on CASA deposits.

Amidst the persistent uncertain and challenging economic conditions of 2023, which continue to prevail during the first quarter of 2024 as well, the Bank has strategically directed surplus liquidity primarily into GoP Ijarah Sukuk while cautiously expanding its Financing portfolio. This strategic approach has yielded a substantial expansion of the Bank’s investment portfolio, which escalated from Rs. 201.13 billion in March 2023 to Rs. 332.25 billion in March 2024, representing an impressive 65.19% increase. Furthermore, the investment portfolio exhibited a growth of 5.8% as compared with December 31, 2023. Consequently, the investment to deposit ratio (IDR) has experienced a significant rise, climbing from 48.9% as at March 31, 2023 to 66.9% as at March 31, 2024.

The Bank demonstrated measured growth in its financing portfolio, achieving a modest increase of 10.1% as compared to the end of 2023. This growth, in addition to decline in deposits, resulted in an improvement in the Bank’s gross Advance to Deposit ratio (ADR), rising from 48.6% in December 2023 to 56.0% in March 2024. Key challenges encountered in expanding the exposure on private sector include elevated policy rates, limited availability of foreign currency and regulatory limitation on consumer auto financing. Notwithstanding these obstacles, the Bank is strategically directing its efforts towards augmenting funding to large corporate and commercial clients, while seizing the prevailing financing prospects. This strategic pivot aims to uphold a resilient financing portfolio in the long term.

Infection ratio of total financing portfolio has improved from 9.0% in December 2023 to 8.2% in March 2024. The infection ratio of Islamic portfolio (i.e. excluding conventional portfolio inherited from amalgamated entity) has also improved from 6.9% in December 2023 to 6.3% in March 2024. While the Bank remains committed to efforts aimed at recovery of the classified portfolio, it maintains a vigilant approach to monitoring the overall health of financing portfolio. Effective January 1, 2024, the Bank has adopted IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments, which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognized in the

# Capital Adequacy Ratio

Ensuring a resilient capital foundation is crucial for maintaining a strong asset portfolio. As of March 31, 2024, the Bank’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) has been reported at 22.82% as compared to 23.79% as at December 31, 2023. This slight decline in CAR is due to increase in Risk Weighted Assets during the first quarter 2024.

# Growth in Revenue

As a result of expansion in our overall balance sheet and the heightened policy rate, the Bank observed a notable 45.5% growth in net spread earned during the first quarter of 2024 as compared to same period last year. The revenues were further supported by increase in other income by 105.9%. This growth in revenue was somewhat subdued due to rise in operating expenses by 35.3%. This rise in operating costs is attributed to country’s heightened inflation cycle, strategic initiatives related to expansion such as opening of new branches, increase in headcount, particularly on the business front and inflationary adjustments to staff remuneration.

# Profit Before Tax

Alhamdulillah! The Bank has accomplished a remarkable 99.5% increase in its profit before tax for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period last year. This outstanding achievement is credited to the Bank’s comprehensive strategy, which included optimizing the CASA mix, fostering growth in low-risk weighted financing portfolios, prioritizing fee-based income and expansion of investment portfolio. As a result, the profit after tax reached Rs. 3.2 billion, marking a substantial increase of 79.2% as compared to same period last year.

## Chunk 13


# Group Results

During the period ended March 31, 2024, the Group witnessed growth of 6.6% in its total assets. This increase in the Group’s financial position was primarily propelled by growth in financing to large corporate and commercial clients and investment in GoP Ijarah Sukuks. Demonstrating exceptional performance, the Group attained a post-tax profit of Rs. 3.2 billion, showcasing an impressive 79.2% surge as compared to the previous year. This outstanding accomplishment is attributed to the augmentation of earning assets, the growth of profit-bearing liabilities, and the increase in policy rates.

# 3.1 Impact of adoption of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments:

Effective from January 1, 2024, the Bank has adopted IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments, which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) vide its BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 has provided detailed instructions (the Application Instructions) on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Standard) to ensure smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks. The Standard will replace the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

# BankIslami Quarterly Report March 2024

Classification and measurement of financial instruments, a new Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for calculating impairment on financial assets and new general hedge accounting requirements. It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and de-recognition of financial instruments from IAS 39.

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 with modified retrospective approach for restatement i.e. changes in accounting policies resulting from adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively, however, the Bank elected not to restate comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening retained earnings and other reserves of the current period. These changes and impacts for the Bank are discussed below:

## Chunk 34


# Classification and measurement of financial assets

The Standard contains three principal classification categories for financial assets i.e. (a) measured at amortised cost, (b) fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) and (c) Fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”). This classification is generally based, except equity instruments and derivatives, on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. The Standard elaborates classification and measurement of financial assets that depend on how these are managed (the entity’s business model) and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at FVTPL regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Bank’s business model in which financial assets are held will determine whether the financial assets are to be measured at amortized cost, FVOCI or FVTPL. The Bank has analyzed the impact of initial application of IFRS 9 on its financial assets as follows:

## Chunk 35


# Equity Securities

Equity instruments are generally measured as FVTPL unless the Bank elects for FVOCI at initial recognition.

For equity shares held as available-for-sale (AFS) with surplus / deficit recorded in OCI, the Bank may elect these equity shares as FVOCI. However, in accordance with requirements of the Standard, fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on de-recognition of these securities.

For those equity shares currently held as AFS with gains and losses recorded in OCI for which FVOCI election is not made, will be measured at FVTPL, with mark to market impacts recorded in profit and loss account for future periods. The surplus / deficit related to these securities currently presented in equity, will be reclassified to retained earnings, with no impact on overall equity with respect to such classification.

Unquoted equity securities are required to be measured at fair value under the Standard.

## Chunk 36


# Debt securities and Islamic Financing and related assets

Those debt securities that are currently classified as AFS and pass the SPPI test, are expected to be measured at FVOCI under the Standard as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows and sell those investment. Debt securities currently classified as HTM and pass the SPPI test are expected to be measured at amortized cost under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows.

Certain debt instruments that do not meet the SPPI criteria shall be measured at FVTPL regardless of the business model in which they are held.

For certain debt securities which are currently classified as AFS and the Bank has decided to designate the same under the Held to Collect Business Model with the intention to collect the future cash flows on initial recognition as permitted under the standard, the mark to market gain / (loss) pertaining to these securities will be reversed from the surplus / deficit and adjusted against the book value of securities at initial recognition. This will have an impact on the overall retained earnings which will be consolidated in the opening retained earnings adjustment under IAS 8 (modified retrospective application criteria) in addition to the ECL impact.

## Chunk 37


# Impairment and measurement of ECL

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), Ijarah / Diminishing Musharaka receivables, and certain financing commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for ECL resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (12-month ECL). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL).

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognized are in ‘stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘stage 3’.

The assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL should be unbiased and probability-weighted and would incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL would take into account the time value of money.

Based on the requirements of the Standard and SBP’s Application Instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment considering the key elements such as assessment of Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR), Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD). These elements are described below:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default, calibrated over the 12 months from the reporting date (stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (stage 2) and incorporating forward looking information.
- LGD: It is an estimate of magnitude of loss sustained on any facility upon default by a customer. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor. It is the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including any form of collateral.
- EAD: the expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortization, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.

For the purpose of calculation of ECL, the Bank has used 10 years’ data till 31 December 2023.

# BankIslami Quarterly Report March 2024

# Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

Under the SBP’s instructions, credit exposure (in local currency) guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Moreover, until implementation of the Standard has stabilized, Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions would be made as per the Standard’s ECL criteria and Stage 3 provisions would be made considering higher of the Standard’s ECL or provision computed under existing requirements of Prudential Regulations (PRs) issued by SBP on a segment basis.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PRs. Financial assets in Stage 2 may be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum period of 6 months from initial downgrade is required before any facility is moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to move back from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it should meet the criteria defined under the respective PR for de-classification of account / facility. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

# Islamic financing related fee

Islamic financing origination / commitment fees that are regarded as compensation to the financer for an ongoing involvement with the acquisition of a financial instrument would be recognized over the life of the related financing. However, if the commitment expires without the financer making the financing, the fee would be recognized as revenue earned.

# Additional requirements and exceptions introduced by SBP Instructions

SBP has enforced the application of Standard in its entirety except for some exceptions and additional requirements. A high-level comparison of such exceptions that are relevant to the Bank is as follows:

1. Use of Fair Value Option for financial assets

Standard allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any ‘accounting mismatch’ that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different bases. SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout life of the instrument. Nonetheless, banks should avoid this option for financial instruments that are categorized as Level 3 in terms of the IFRS 13 hierarchy.

# (ii) Unquoted equity securities

SBP has advised banks to measure investment in unquoted equity securities at lower of cost or breakup value till 31, December 2023. In case where the breakup value of such securities is less than the cost, the difference of the cost and the breakup value will be classified as loss and provided for by charging it to the Profit and Loss account.

## Chunk 42


# (iii) Rebuttable presumptions about default and SICR

Standard includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under the Standard as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022. However, banks are free to choose more stringent days past due criteria.

# (iv) Income recognition on impaired assets

The banks are advised to recognize income on impaired assets (loans classified under PRs i.e., OAEM and Stage 3 loans) on a receipt basis in accordance with the requirements of PRs issued by SBP.

# (v) Impact of Provisions on Regulatory Capital

The banks are allowed to include provisions for Stage 1 and Stage 2 in Tier 2 capital up to a limit of 1.25% of total credit risk-weighted assets. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL provisioning on capital, a transitional arrangement is allowed to the banks to absorb the impact on regulatory capital. Accordingly, banks, which choose to apply transitional arrangement, may implement this arrangement in accordance with SBP’s Guideline for absorption of ECL for Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) purposes as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022.

# Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank has adopted a governance framework requiring the Risk, Finance, Operations, Internal Audit and IT functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. IFRS 9 requires robust credit risk models that can predict Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD).

The Bank’s Risk Management Department has developed models/ methodologies for PD, LGD and Credit Conversion Factors (CCF). These models shall be validated on annual basis considering the following:

- Quantitative Validation: ECL model design validation, data quality validation and benchmarking with external best practices.
- Quantitative Validation: Calibration testing which ensures the accuracy of the observed PDs.

The Risk Department will define the staging criteria for the new impairment model and take ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach.

|34|FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS| | | |
| |The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity or investments in associates and subsidiary, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost less impairment losses. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiary, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.| | | |
| |The fair value of unquoted Shariah compliant securities, fixed term financing, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.| | | |
|34.1|Fair value of financial assets| | | |
| |The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:| | | |
| |Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.| | | |
| |Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).| | | |

# 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The significant accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the audited annual financial statements of the Holding Company for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for changes resulting from adoption of following:

- IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

# 3.1 Impact of adoption of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments:

Effective from January 1, 2024, the Holding Company has adopted IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments, which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) vide its BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 has provided detailed instructions (the Application Instructions) on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Standard) to ensure smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks. The Standard will replace the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The Standard includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, a new Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for calculating impairment on financial assets and new general hedge accounting requirements. It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and de-recognition of financial instruments from IAS 39.

The Holding Company has adopted IFRS 9 with modified retrospective approach for restatement i.e. changes in accounting policies resulting from adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively, however, the Holding Company elected not to restate comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening retained earnings and other reserves of the current period. These changes and impacts for the Holding Company are discussed below:

## Chunk 131


# Classification and measurement of financial assets

The Standard contains three principal classification categories for financial assets i.e. (a) measured at amortised cost, (b) fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) and (c) Fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”). This classification is generally based, except equity instruments and derivatives, on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows.

and selling financial assets. The Standard elaborates classification and measurement of financial assets that depend on how these are managed (the entity’s business model) and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at FVTPL regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Holding Company’s business model in which financial assets are held will determine whether the financial assets are to be measured at amortized cost, FVOCI or FVTPL. The Holding Company has analyzed the impact of initial application of IFRS 9 on its financial assets as follows:

## Chunk 132


# Equity Securities

Equity instruments are generally measured as FVTPL unless the Holding Company elects for FVOCI at initial recognition.

For equity shares held as available-for-sale (AFS) with surplus / deficit recorded in OCI, the Holding Company may elect these equity shares as FVOCI. However, in accordance with requirements of the Standard, fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on de-recognition of these securities.

For those equity shares currently held as AFS with gains and losses recorded in OCI for which FVOCI election is not made, will be measured at FVTPL, with mark to market impacts recorded in profit and loss account for future periods. The surplus/ deficit related to these securities currently presented in equity, will be reclassified to retained earnings, with no impact on overall equity with respect to such classification.

Unquoted equity securities are required to be measured at fair value under the Standard.

## Chunk 133


# Debt securities and Islamic Financing and related assets

Those debt securities that are currently classified as AFS and pass the SPPI test, are expected to be measured at FVOCI under the Standard as the Holding Company’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows and sell those investment. Debt securities currently classified as HTM and pass the SPPI test are expected to be measured at amortized cost under IFRS 9 as the Holding Company’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows.

Certain debt instruments that do not meet the SPPI criteria shall be measured at FVTPL regardless of the business model in which they are held.

For certain debt securities which are currently classified as AFS and the Holding Company has decided to designate the same under the Held to Collect Business Model with the intention to collect the future cash flows on initial recognition as permitted under the standard, the mark to market gain / (loss) pertaining to these securities will be reversed from the surplus / deficit and adjusted against the book value of securities at initial recognition. This will have an impact on the overall retained earnings which will be consolidated in the opening retained earnings adjustment under IAS 8 (modified retrospective application criteria) in addition to the ECL impact.

# Impairment and measurement of ECL

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), Ijarah / Diminishing Musharaka receivables, and certain financing commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is

required for ECL resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (12-month ECL). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL).

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognized are in ‘stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘stage 3’.

The assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL should be unbiased and probability-weighted and would incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL would take into account the time value of money.

Based on the requirements of the Standard and SBP’s Application Instructions, the Holding Company has performed an ECL assessment considering the key elements such as assessment of Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR), Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD). These elements are described below:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default, calibrated over the 12 months from the reporting date (stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (stage 2) and incorporating forward looking information.
- LGD: It is an estimate of magnitude of loss sustained on any facility upon default by a customer. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor. It is the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Holding Company expects to receive, including any form of collateral.
- EAD: the expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortization, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.

For the purpose of calculation of ECL, the Holding Company has used 10 years’ data till 31 December 2023.

# Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Holding Company uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR.

Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

Under the SBP’s instructions, credit exposure (in local currency) guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Moreover, until implementation of the Standard has stabilized, Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions would be made as per the Standard’s ECL criteria and Stage 3 provisions would be made considering higher of the Standard’s ECL or provision computed under existing requirements of Prudential Regulations (PRs) issued by SBP on a segment basis.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PRs. Financial assets in Stage 2 may be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum period of 6 months from initial downgrade is required before any facility is moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to move back from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it should meet the criteria defined under the respective PR for de-classification of account / facility. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

# Islamic financing related fee

Islamic financing origination / commitment fees that are regarded as compensation to the financer for an ongoing involvement with the acquisition of a financial instrument would be recognized over the life of the related financing. However, if the commitment expires without the financer making the financing, the fee would be recognized as revenue earned.

# Additional requirements and exceptions introduced by SBP Instructions

SBP has enforced the application of Standard in its entirety except for some exceptions and additional requirements. A high-level comparison of such exceptions that are relevant to the Holding Company is as follows:

1. # Use of Fair Value Option for financial assets

Standard allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any ‘accounting mismatch’ that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different bases. SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout life of the instrument. Nonetheless, banks should avoid this option for financial instruments that are categorized as Level 3 in terms of the IFRS 13 hierarchy.
2. # Unquoted equity securities

SBP has advised banks to measure investment in unquoted equity securities at lower of cost or breakup value till 31, December 2023. In case where the breakup value of such securities is less than the cost, the difference of the cost and the breakup value will be classified as loss and provided for by charging it to the Profit and Loss account.
3. # Rebuttable presumptions about default and SICR

Standard includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under the Standard as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022. However, banks are free to choose more stringent days past due criteria.

# (v) Impact of Provisions on Regulatory Capital

The banks are allowed to include provisions for Stage 1 and Stage 2 in Tier 2 capital up to a limit of 1.25% of total credit risk-weighted assets. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL provisioning on capital, a transitional arrangement is allowed to the banks to absorb the impact on regulatory capital. Accordingly, banks, which choose to apply transitional arrangement, may implement this arrangement in accordance with SBP’s Guideline for absorption of ECL for Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) purposes as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022.

# Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Holding Company has adopted a governance framework requiring the Risk, Finance, Operations, Internal Audit and IT functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. IFRS 9 requires robust credit risk models that can predict Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD).

The Holding Company’s Risk Management Department has developed models/methodologies for PD, LGD and Credit Conversion Factors (CCF). These models shall be validated on annual basis considering the following:

- Quantitative Validation: ECL model design validation, data quality validation and benchmarking with external best practices.
- Quantitative Validation: Calibration testing which ensures the accuracy of the observed PDs.

The Risk Department will define the staging criteria for the new impairment model and take ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach. Additionally, the Risk department will also take the ownership of the impact of ECL on Holding Company’s capital.

The Holding Company’s Finance Department will perform ECL calculation. As a result, the department will then assess the financial impact, meet the financial reporting requirements and further monitor the impact on the financial ratios. Risk Management Department shall also present quarterly progress report to its Board Risk Management Committee.

The IT Department shall identify, prepare and extract the data required for the risk parameters modelling and ECL calculations. IT department shall also support project owners for system development and upgrades.

|34|FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS| | | |
| |The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity or investments in associates and subsidiary, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost less impairment losses. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiary, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.| | | |
| |The fair value of unquoted Shariah compliant securities, fixed term financing, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.| | | |
|34.1|Fair value of financial assets| | | |
| |The Holding Company measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:| | | |
| |Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.| | | |
| |Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).| | | |
