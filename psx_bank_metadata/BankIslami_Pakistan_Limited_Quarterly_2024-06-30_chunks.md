# Economy Snapshot

In FY2023-24, Pakistan’s GDP grew by just 2.4%, falling short of the 3.5% target. This shortfall was primarily due to political instability, the devastating floods of 2022, and the global impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which led to disruptions in commodity prices and supply chains.

To address the ensuing domestic and external imbalances, a 9-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with IMF was implemented. The SBA focused on several key areas:

- Fiscal Adjustment and Debt Sustainability: Measures were taken to correct fiscal imbalances and ensure debt sustainability, which were critical for stabilizing the economy.
- Social Spending: Despite the need for fiscal discipline, the arrangement ensured that social spending remained a priority, protecting the most vulnerable populations.
- Resilience to External Shocks: Policies were put in place to bolster the economy’s ability to withstand external shocks, particularly those related to global commodity markets and supply chains.
- Structural Reforms: The program emphasized significant structural reforms, particularly in the energy sector, to improve efficiency and sustainability. Additionally, governance reforms were introduced in State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to enhance performance and accountability.
- Climate Resilience: Given the devastating impact of recent floods, the program also included initiatives to build climate resilience, ensuring that the economy is better prepared for future environmental challenges.

Pakistan’s headline inflation rose to 12.6% year-on-year in June 2024, up from 11.8% in May. On a month-on-month basis, inflation increased by 0.5% bringing the FY24 average to 23.8%, marking a notable decrease from the 29.4% recorded in June 2023.

Pakistan’s current account deficit (CAD) dropped sharply by 79% to $681 mn in FY2023-2024, down from $3.275 bn during previous year, marking the lowest CAD in 13 years at just 0.2% of GDP. This significant improvement was driven by a 6% reduction in the trade deficit and an 11% rise in remittances. Contributing factors include low economic growth, high inflation, increased exports, high interest rates, and import restrictions.

The Central Bank of Pakistan lowered its policy rate to 19.5% by 100 basis points on July 29, 2024, consistent with market expectations. This decision follows a 150 basis point cut in June and is attributed to stronger-than-expected inflation results for June 2024 and progress in the external account, with FX reserves increasing despite continued debt repayments.

The State Bank of Pakistan’s tight monetary policy remains crucial until inflation moderates, coupled with necessary improvements in the foreign exchange (FX) market and the rebuilding of foreign reserves. The recent staff-level agreement with the IMF on a 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF), valued at approximately $7 bn, is pivotal for achieving stability across all.

Economic fronts. Continued support from development and bilateral partners is also essential for the program’s success.

The IMF anticipates a 3.5% growth in Pakistan’s GDP for FY2024-25, slightly below the 3.6% target set by the government, amidst a sluggish global economy. CPI inflation is expected to average around 13%, and the policy rate is forecasted to fall to 15% during the fiscal year.

The Bank’s long-term credit rating has been maintained at AA- by PACRA for 2024, reflecting the stability of its credit profile. Notably, this rating was upgraded during 2023, highlighting the Bank’s continued financial strength and positive performance.

The Bank’s deposit portfolio witnessed a significant growth of 18.95% as compared to the period ended June 30, 2023, also reflecting an increase of 5.39% as compared to December 31, 2023. This growth was primarily driven by a 7% rise in Current Account (CA) since December 31, 2023. As a result, the Bank’s CA ratio has improved from 37.32% to 37.88%.

Since 2022, the Bank has successfully maintained CASA deposits above 60%, reflecting growing consumer confidence, enhanced liquidity, and a strategic focus on growing CASA through expanding trade finance business, employee banking, and cash management mandates.

Amidst the persistent uncertain and challenging economic conditions of 2023, which continued

to prevail during the first half of 2024 as well, the Bank has strategically directed surplus liquidity primarily into GoP Ijarah Sukuk while cautiously expanding its Financing portfolio. This strategic approach has yielded a substantial expansion of the Bank’s investment portfolio, which escalated from Rs. 204 bn in June 2023 to Rs. 347 bn in June 2024, representing an impressive 69.75% increase. Furthermore, the investment portfolio exhibited a growth of 10.3% as compared with December 31, 2023. Consequently, the investment to deposit ratio (IDR) has experienced a significant rise, climbing from 44.1% as at June 30, 2023 to 62.9% as at June 30, 2024.

The Bank’s gross financing portfolio has decreased by 12.8% compared to the end of 2023. This reduction reflects a strategic shift by the Bank to withdraw from low yielding segments. This decline in financing, combined with growth in deposits, led to a decrease in the Bank’s gross Advance to Deposit Ratio (ADR), from 48.6% in December 2023 to 40.2% in June 2024.

During the period, the Bank encountered several challenges in expanding its private sector exposure, including elevated policy rates—despite a 150 basis point reduction since January 2024—limited availability of foreign currency and regulatory constraints on consumer auto financing. Amidst these challenges, the Bank is strategically focusing on increasing funding to selective large corporate, commercial and SME clients, capitalizing on current financing opportunities, and exploring new investment avenues. These efforts aim to maintain profitability while prioritizing the quality of the financing portfolio. This strategic pivot is designed to sustain a resilient financing portfolio over the long term. Hence, the Bank aims to improve the ADR higher than 50% by the end of the current year.

The strategic reduction in financing has resulted in an increase in the infection ratio, rising from 9% as at the end of 2023 to 10.9% in the current period. In absolute terms, the delinquent financing portfolio has increased by Rs. 2.4 bn during the current period. The Bank’s specialized team is making diligent efforts for recovering from delinquent financing portfolio, hence aims to reduce the infection ratio.

The adoption of IFRS 9 by Pakistani banks effective January 1, 2024, represents a significant shift in the financial reporting landscape, aligning local practices with international standards. The impact of adoption of IFRS 9 has been disclosed in detail in note 3.1 to the condensed interim financial statements.

Ensuring a resilient capital foundation is essential for maintaining a robust asset portfolio. As of June 30, 2024, the Bank’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) stands at 24.83%, an increase from 23.79% as of December 31, 2023.

Due to the expansion of our overall balance sheet, net spread has increased to Rs. 21.9 bn from Rs. 16.6 bn in the corresponding period last year, reflecting a 32% rise. Non-funded income has also seen a significant increase of 57.4%, reaching Rs. 2.6 bn compared to Rs. 1.6 bn in the previous corresponding period. The 35.4% rise in operating costs is primarily attributed to the country’s heightened inflation cycle, strategic expansion initiatives—including the opening of new branches and an increase in headcount, particularly on the business front—and inflationary adjustments to staff remuneration.

Alhamdulillah! The Bank has achieved a remarkable profit before tax of Rs. 13.79 bn for the first half of 2024, reflecting a notable 66.24% growth compared to the same period last year. This outstanding performance is attributed to the Bank’s strategic initiatives, including optimizing the CASA mix, and prioritizing fee-based income on the back of growing trade business volumes, cash management and employee banking mandates. Consequently, profit after tax reached Rs. 7.1 bn, marking a substantial increase of 38.6% compared to the previous year. The Basic Earnings per Share improved to Rs. 6.37 in June 2024, up from Rs. 4.59 for the corresponding period last year.

Demonstrating exceptional performance, the Group attained a post-tax profit of Rs. 7.06 bn, showcasing an impressive 38.5% surge as compared to the corresponding period last year.

# Achievement and Initiatives

# Distribution

BankIslami has successfully expanded its deposit base to Rs. 551 bn in the year 2024, driven by a strategic shift in its approach. The Bank navigated the increasingly competitive landscape for low-cost deposits intensified by rising policy rates and heightened government borrowing needs by achieving a 5.39% growth in deposits. A key factor in this growth was an addition of more than 50 new branches to its network, contributing significantly to the increase in deposits. With plans to expand further, BankIslami aims to continue strengthening its deposit base. The Bank has also managed to maintain its CASA ratio above 60%, underscoring its effective portfolio management. Introduction of new products is pivotal to long-term success of the Bank, in this regard the Bank has introduced WhatsApp onboarding process for one of its products viz. GenZ accounts.

Despite facing challenging economic conditions that significantly impacted the banking sector’s trade operations, the Bank achieved a notable 37% increase in its trade volume compared to the same period last year. This growth was largely driven by substantial gains in export trade, which rose by approximately 46%.

The Bank’s corporate client coverage teams across Pakistan are fully prepared to expand the corporate financing portfolio through a targeted strategy and close customer engagement.

The Bank has placed significant emphasis on enhancing its export business during the first half of 2024. This effort is aimed at maintaining a balanced import-export ratio and generating sufficient foreign exchange liquidity to fund imports.

# Investment Banking

Investment Banking’s contribution to the Bank’s fund based income is evident through the participation in syndicated financing, project financing, and bilateral-structured transactions. This is further enhanced by fee and float income associated with these transactions.

During the first half of 2024, BankIslami successfully closed significant investment banking transactions totaling PKR 121 billion as Lead or Joint Lead Arranger. These included one of the largest long-term syndicated financing facilities in the private sector for a leading telecom company, and one of the largest project finance facilities for an industrial water supply project under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model in Thar, Sindh. We are pleased to announce that the Bank received two prestigious awards this year for its Investment Banking deals: “Domestic Trade Finance Bank of the Year 2024” by the ABF Wholesale Banking Awards and “Water Deal of the Year 2024” by the Triple A Sustainable Infrastructure Awards.

Looking ahead, our strategy is to collaborate with peer banks on syndicate and debt capital market (DCM) transactions to secure high-quality long-term assets while maintaining a lead or co-lead role. We will also focus on enhancing deal flow by closely engaging with regional client coverage teams and leveraging our expertise in the DCM market, specifically in ICP/ Sukuk.

# Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”. A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilized and the appropriate portion of profit thereon. The income on such financing is recognized in accordance with the principles of Islamic Shariah. However, income, if any, received which does not comply with the principles of Islamic Shariah is recognized as charity payable as directed by the Shariah Board of the Bank.

# 3.1 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments:

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) vide its BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 has provided detailed instructions (the Application Instructions) on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Standard) to ensure smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks. As per SBP BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9 is applicable on banks with effect from January 01, 2024. IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of accounting for financial liabilities. To determine appropriate classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments, to be assessed based on combination of the entity’s business model for managing the assets and the instruments’ contractual cash flow characteristics (SPPI assessment). The adoption of IFRS 9 has also fundamentally changed the accounting landscape.

changed the impairment method of financial assets with a forward-looking Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach.

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 with modified retrospective approach for restatement i.e. changes in accounting policies resulting from adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively. However, the Bank elected not to restate comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening retained earnings and other reserves of the current period. These changes and impacts for the Bank are discussed below:

SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 05, 2024 have made certain amendments and extended timelines of application instructions for certain areas where the banking industry has sought more time. These amendments and relaxations include use of modification accounting for financial assets and liabilities as per IFRS 9 standard and recording and treatment of staff loan and finances at reduced rates from October 01, 2024. Further, the banks have been asked to use existing practices of recordings of profit income using effective profit rate and ensure full recognition of above mentioned concessions from October 01, 2024. Moreover, SBP has allowed an extension to banks up to December 31, 2024 for developing the requisite models for calculating Exposure at Default for revolving products beyond the contractual date. In addition the banks have also been allowed to continue existing practice of valuing unquoted equity investment at their cost or breakup value, whichever is lower, till December 31, 2024 and perform fair valuation of these investments afterwards.

# Financial Assets

After adoption of IFRS 9, existing categories of financial assets: Held for trading (HFT), Available for sale (AFS), Held to maturity (HTM) and loans and receivables have been replaced by:

- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss account (FVTPL)
- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- Financial assets at amortised cost

# Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognised in profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective yield rate method. Profit expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit and loss.

# 3.1.2 Business Model and SPPI Assessments

Under IFRS 9, the classification of the financial assets is based on two criteria: a) the Bank’s business model for managing the assets; and b) whether the instruments’ contractual cash flows represent ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on the principal amount outstanding (the ‘SPPI criterion’).

# Business model assessment

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective. The Bank’s business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular profit rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realizing cash flows through the sale of the assets.
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity’s key management personnel.
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed.
- How managers of the business are compensated (e.g., whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected).
- The fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected); and
- The expected frequency, volume and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank’s assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Group’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realized.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking ‘worst case’ or ‘stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Bank’s original expectations, the Bank does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.

Transfer of financial assets to third parties in transactions do not qualify for derecognition because such transfer does not effect the bank’s contractual rights to receive the cash flows associated with the said financial assets and is consistent with the Bank’s continuing recognition criteria of the financial assets.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:

- Hold to Collect (HTC) business model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash flows.
- Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S) business model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
- Other business models: Held for trading which is evaluated on fair value basis and measured at FVTPL because they neither are held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

# b) Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)

The Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test.
‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium/discount).
The most significant elements of profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the profit rate is set.
In contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than de minimis exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding. In such cases, the financial asset is required to be measured at FVTPL.

# a) Amortised cost (AC)

The Bank classifies its debt based financial assets at amortised cost only if both of the following criteria are met and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect Contractual Cash Flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI test) on the principal amount outstanding.

Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value.
After initial measurement, these financial instruments are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Profit Rate (EPR), less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees that are an integral part of the EIR. The amortisation is included in “Profit Income” in the Income Statement.

# 3.1.4 Derecognition

# Financial assets

The Bank de-recognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

On de-recognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset de-recognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI is recognised in profit and loss. Cumulative gain / loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI is not recognised in profit and loss on de-recognition of such securities.

# Financial liabilities

A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition.

# 3.1.5 Modification

# Financial Assets

When the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified as a result of commercial restructuring activity rather than due to credit risk and impairment considerations, the Bank performs an assessment to determine whether the modifications result in the derecognition of that financial asset.

If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

Where derecognition of financial assets is appropriate, the newly recognised residual financial assets are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classified as purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI).

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the bank first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective yield rate of the asset and recognize the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit and loss. If such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as profit income calculated using the effective yield rate method.

# Financial Liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability recognized and consideration paid is recognized in profit and loss. Consideration paid includes non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability.

If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective yield rate and the resulting gain and loss is recognized in profit and loss. For financial liabilities, the Bank considers a modification to be substantial based on qualitative factors and if it results in a difference between the adjusted discounted present value and the original carrying amount of the financial liability of, or greater than, ten percent.

Financial assets are reclassified at their fair value on the date of reclassification and previously recognised gains and losses are not restated. Moreover, reclassifications of financial assets between financial assets held at amortised cost and financial assets held at FVOCI do not affect effective yield rate or expected credit loss computations.

Where financial assets held at amortised cost are reclassified to financial assets held at FVTPL, the difference between the fair value of the assets at the date of reclassification and the previously recognised amortised cost is recognised in statement of profit and loss.

For financial assets held at amortised cost that are reclassified to FVOCI, the difference between the fair value of the assets at the date of reclassification and the previously recognised gross carrying value is recognised in comprehensive income. Additionally, the related cumulative expected credit loss amounts relating to the reclassified financial assets are reclassified from provisions to a separate reserve in comprehensive income at the date of reclassification.

In addition, the date of reclassification is used as the date of initial recognition for the calculation of expected credit losses. Where financial assets held at FVTPL are reclassified to financial assets held at amortised cost, the fair value at the date of reclassification becomes the gross carrying value of the financial asset.

Certain financing commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for ECL resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (12-month ECL). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL).

Under the general approach of IFRS 9 impairment, the financial assets are classified into three stages. Each stage indicates the credit quality of the particular financial asset as described below:

# Stage 1

Includes financial instruments that have not had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or that have low credit risk at the reporting date. For these assets, 12 month expected credit losses (‘ECL’) are recognized and profit is calculated on the gross carrying amount of the asset (that is, without deduction for credit allowance). 12 month ECL are the expected credit losses that result from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. It is not the expected cash shortfalls over the 12-month period but the entire credit loss on an asset weighted by the probability that the loss will occur in the next 12 months.

Includes financial instruments that have had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition (unless they have low credit risk at the reporting date) but that do not have objective evidence of impairment. For these assets, lifetime ECL are recognized, but the profit is still calculated on the gross carrying amount of the asset. Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument. Expected credit losses are the weighted average credit losses with the probability of default (‘PD’) as the weight.

# Stage 3

Includes financial instruments that have objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date. This stage has obligors that already are impaired (defaulted).

The assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL should be unbiased and probability-weighted and would incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL would take into account the time value of money.

Based on the requirements of the Standard and SBP’s Application Instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment considering the key elements such as assessment of Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR), Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD). These elements are described below:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default, calibrated over the 12 months from the reporting date (stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (stage 2) and incorporating forward looking information.
- LGD: It is an estimate of magnitude of loss sustained on any facility upon default by a customer. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor. It is the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including any form of collateral.
- EAD: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.

# Measurement of ECL

ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:

- financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive);
- financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows;
- undrawn financing commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive; and
- financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Bank expects to recover.

# Restructured financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognized and ECL are measured as follows:

- if the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset.
- if the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective yield rate of the existing financial asset.

# Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognized

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognized are in ‘Stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘Stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘Stage 3’.

# Non-Performing financial assets

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI are credit-impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘non-performing’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;

- the restructuring of a financing by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise;

- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or

- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

A financing that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail financing that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.

Under the IFRS 9 Application instructions, the Bank is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. The Bank is required to calculate ECL on its non-performing financial assets as higher of provision under Prudential Regulations (PR) or ECL under IFRS 9.

The Bank calculates the ECL against corporate, commercial & SME financing portfolios as higher of PR or ECL under IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level, whereas against the retail borrowers the Bank will calculate ECL at higher of PR or ECL under IFRS 9 at segment / product basis as instructed under Annexure-A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024.

For the purpose of calculation of ECL, the Bank has used 10 years’ data till 31 December 2023.

# 3.1.8 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

Under the SBP’s instructions, credit exposure (in local currency) guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Moreover, until implementation of the Standard has stabilized, Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions would be made as per the Standard’s ECL criteria and Stage 3 provisions would be made considering higher of the Standard’s ECL or provision computed under existing requirements of Prudential Regulations (PRs) issued by SBP on a segment basis for retail financing and ORR obligor basis for corporate / commercial / SME portfolio.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PRs. Financial assets in Stage 2 may be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum cooling period of 3 months / 3 installments (whichever is last) is required before any financial asset is moved back to Stage 1. Any upgrading from stage 3 to stage 2 must be subject to a cooling off period of as per prudential regulations. If the facility has been regular during the cooling off period, it will move back to Stage 2 after which the criteria for moving from Stage 2 to Stage 1 will apply. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

# IFRS 9

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022.

The Bank will not rebut the 30 DPD presumption as a key SICR criterion. The Bank may override the criteria supported by reasonable evidence on a case by case basis. This includes:

- Cases of technical delinquencies (for example, accounts marked as DPD 30+ owing to administrative reasons and not credit related concerns; or cases where there is no dispute regarding payment amount).
- Cases of delinquencies where payments on facilities are linked to government payments causing such delinquencies.

However, any such specific override will require approval from Chief Risk Officer.

The Bank measures ECL on a lifetime basis for Purchased or originated credit - Impaired (POCI) instruments throughout the life of the instrument. However, ECL is not recognised in a separate loss provision on initial recognition for POCI instruments as the lifetime expected credit loss is inherent within the gross carrying amount of the instruments. The Bank recognises the change in lifetime expected credit losses arising subsequent to initial recognition in the profit and loss account and the cumulative change as a loss provision. Where lifetime ECL on POCI instruments are less than those at initial recognition, then the favorable differences are recognised as impairment gains in the statement of profit and loss.

# Undrawn financing commitments and guarantees

‘Financial guarantees’ are contracts that require the Bank to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. ‘Financing commitments’ are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions.

Financial guarantees issued or commitments to provide a financing at a below-market profit rate are initially measured at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at the higher of the loss allowance determined in accordance with IFRS 9 and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.

When estimating lifetime ECL for undrawn financings commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the financings are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

# 3.1.9 Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank has adopted a governance framework requiring the Risk, Finance, Operations, Internal Audit and IT functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business.

# BankIslami Half Yearly Report June 2024

IFRS 9 requires robust credit risk models that can predict Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD).

The Bank’s Risk Management Department has developed models / methodologies for PD, LGD and Credit Conversion Factors (CCF). These models shall be validated on annual basis considering the following aspects:

- Quantitative Validation: ECL model design validation, data quality validation and benchmarking with external best practices.
- Quantitative Validation: Calibration testing which ensures the accuracy of the observed PDs.

The Risk Department will define the staging criteria for the new impairment model and take ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach. Additionally, the Risk department will also take the ownership of the impact of ECL on bank’s capital.

The Bank’s Finance Department will perform ECL calculation. As a result, the department will then assess the financial impact, meet the financial reporting requirements and further monitor the impact on the financial ratios. Risk Management Department shall also present quarterly progress report to its Board Risk Management Committee.

The IT Department shall identify, prepare and extract the data required for the risk parameters modelling and ECL calculations. IT department shall also support project owners for system development and upgrades.

# 3.1 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments:

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) vide its BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 has provided detailed instructions (the Application Instructions) on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Standard) to ensure smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks.

As per SBP BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9 is applicable on banks with effect from January 01, 2024. IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of accounting for financial liabilities. To determine appropriate classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments, to be assessed based on combination of the entity’s business model for managing the assets and the instruments’ contractual cash flow characteristics (SPPI assessment). The adoption of IFRS 9 has also fundamentally changed the impairment method of financial assets with a forward-looking Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach.

The Holding Company has adopted IFRS 9 with modified retrospective approach for restatement i.e. changes in accounting policies resulting from adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively. However, the Holding Company elected not to restate comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening retained earnings and other reserves of the current period. These changes and impacts for the Holding Company are discussed below:

SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 05, 2024 have made certain amendments and extended timelines of application instructions for certain areas where the banking industry has sought more time. These amendments and relaxations include use of modification accounting for financial assets and liabilities as per IFRS 9 standard and recording and treatment of staff loan and finances at reduced rates from October 01, 2024. Further, the banks have been asked to use existing practices of recordings of profit income using effective profit rate and ensure full recognition of above mentioned concessions from October 01, 2024. Moreover, SBP has allowed an extension to banks up to December 31, 2024 for developing the requisite models for calculating Exposure at Default for revolving products beyond the contractual date. In addition the banks have also been allowed to continue existing practice of valuing unquoted equity investment at their cost or breakup value, whichever is lower, till December 31, 2024 and perform fair valuation of these investments afterwards.

After adoption of IFRS 9, existing categories of financial assets: Held for trading (HFT), Available for sale (AFS), Held to maturity (HTM) and loans and receivables have been replaced by:

- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss account (FVTPL)
- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- Financial assets at amortised cost

# Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognised in profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective yield rate method. Profit expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit and loss.

# 3.1.2 Business Model and SPPI Assessments

Under IFRS 9, the classification of the financial assets is based on two criteria: a) the Holding Company’s business model for managing the assets; and b) whether the instruments’ contractual cash flows represent ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on the principal amount outstanding (the ‘SPPI criterion’).

## Chunk 155


# a) Business model assessment

The Holding Company determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Holding Company’s business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular profit rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realizing cash flows through the sale of the assets.
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity’s key management personnel.
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed.
- How managers of the business are compensated (e.g., whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected).
- The fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected); and
- The expected frequency, volume and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Holding Company’s assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Group’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realized.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking ‘worst case’ or ‘stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Holding Company’s original expectations, the Holding Company does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.

Transfer of financial assets to third parties in transactions do not qualify for derecognition.

because such transfer does not effect the Holding Company’s contractual rights to receive the cash flows associated with the said financial assets and is consistent with the Holding Company’s continuing recognition criteria of the financial assets.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:

- Hold to Collect (HTC) business model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash flows.
- Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S) business model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
- Other business models: Held for trading which is evaluated on fair value basis and measured at FVTPL because they neither are held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

b) Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)

The Holding Company assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test.

‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium/discount).

The most significant elements of profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Holding Company applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the profit rate is set.

In contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than de minimis exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding. In such cases, the financial asset is required to be measured at FVTPL.

# 3.1.3 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

The classification and subsequent measurement requirements of IFRS 9 categories are as follows;

a) Amortised cost (AC)

The Holding Company classifies its debt based financial assets at amortised cost only if both of the following criteria are met and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect Contractual Cash Flows; and

- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI test) on the principal amount outstanding.

Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value.

After initial measurement, these financial instruments are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Profit Rate (EPR), less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees that are an integral part of the EIR. The amortisation is included in “Profit Income” in the Income Statement.

## Chunk 158


# b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income comprise:

- equity securities which are not held for trading, and for which the company has made an irrevocable election at initial recognition to recognize changes in fair value through OCI rather than profit or loss, and
- debt securities where the contractual cash flows are solely principal and interest and the objective of the company’s business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value. These financial instruments are subsequently measured at fair value. Movements in the carrying amount from one reporting date to another are taken through OCI.

## Chunk 159


# c) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

The Holding Company classifies the following financial assets at fair value through profit and loss:

- debt investments that do not qualify for measurement at either amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income; and
- equity investments that are held for trading.

Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognised at fair value. In addition, on initial recognition, the Holding Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency.

These financial instruments are subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVTPL are recognised through profit and loss. Interest income from debt instruments is included in the finance income.

# 3.1.4 Derecognition

# Financial assets

The Holding Company de-recognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Holding Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

On de-recognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset de-recognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI is recognised in profit and loss. Cumulative gain / loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI is not recognised in profit and loss on de-recognition of such securities.

# Financial liabilities

A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability and the consideration paid is recognised in profit and loss.

## Chunk 162


# 3.1.5 Modification

# Financial Assets

When the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified as a result of commercial restructuring activity rather than due to credit risk and impairment considerations, the Holding Company performs an assessment to determine whether the modifications result in the derecognition of that financial asset.

If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the Holding Company plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

Where derecognition of financial assets is appropriate, the newly recognised residual financial assets are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classified as purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI).

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the Holding Company first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective yield rate of the

# Financial Liabilities

The Holding Company derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability recognized and consideration paid is recognized in profit and loss. Consideration paid includes non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability.

If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective yield rate and the resulting gain and loss is recognized in profit and loss.

For financial liabilities, the Holding Company considers a modification to be substantial based on qualitative factors and if it results in a difference between the adjusted discounted present value and the original carrying amount of the financial liability of, or greater than, ten percent.

# 3.1.6 Reclassification

Financial liabilities are not reclassified subsequent to initial recognition. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Holding Company changes its business models for managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following changes in the business model.

Financial assets are reclassified at their fair value on the date of reclassification and previously recognised gains and losses are not restated. Moreover, reclassifications of financial assets between financial assets held at amortised cost and financial assets held at FVOCI do not affect effective yield rate or expected credit loss computations.

# Reclassified from amortised cost

Where financial assets held at amortised cost are reclassified to financial assets held at FVTPL, the difference between the fair value of the assets at the date of reclassification and the previously recognised amortised cost is recognised in statement of profit and loss.

For financial assets held at amortised cost that are reclassified to FVOCI, the difference between the fair value of the assets at the date of reclassification and the previously recognised gross carrying value is recognised in comprehensive income. Additionally, the related cumulative expected credit loss amounts relating to the reclassified financial assets are reclassified from provisions to a separate reserve in comprehensive income at the date of reclassification.

# Reclassified from fair value through other comprehensive income

Where financial assets held at FVOCI are reclassified to financial assets held at FVTPL, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in comprehensive income is transferred to the profit and loss.

For financial assets held at FVOCI that are reclassified to financial assets held at amortised cost, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in comprehensive income is adjusted against the fair value of the financial asset such that the financial asset is recorded at a value as if it had always been held at amortised cost. In addition, the related cumulative expected credit losses held within comprehensive income are reversed against the gross carrying value of the reclassified assets at the date of reclassification.

Where financial assets held at FVTPL are reclassified to financial assets held at FVOCI or financial assets held at amortised cost, the fair value at the date of reclassification is used to determine the effective yield rate on the financial asset going forward. In addition, the date of reclassification is used as the date of initial recognition for the calculation of expected credit losses. Where financial assets held at FVTPL are reclassified to financial assets held at amortised cost, the fair value at the date of reclassification becomes the gross carrying value of the financial asset.

# 3.1.7 Impairment and measurement of ECL

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), Ijarah / Diminishing Musharaka receivables, and certain financing commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for ECL resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (12-month ECL). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL).

Under the general approach of IFRS 9 impairment, the financial assets are classified into three stages. Each stage indicates the credit quality of the particular financial asset as described below:

## Chunk 170


# Stage 1

Includes financial instruments that have not had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or that have low credit risk at the reporting date. For these assets, 12 month expected credit losses (‘ECL’) are recognized and profit is calculated on the gross carrying amount of the asset (that is, without deduction for credit allowance). 12 month ECL are the expected credit losses that result from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. It is not the expected cash shortfalls over the 12-month period but the entire credit loss on an asset weighted by the probability that the loss will occur in the next 12 months.

# Stage 2

Includes financial instruments that have had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition (unless they have low credit risk at the reporting date) but that do not have objective evidence of impairment. For these assets, lifetime ECL are recognized, but the profit is still calculated on the gross carrying amount of the asset. Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument. Expected credit losses are the weighted average credit losses with the probability of default (‘PD’) as the weight.

Stage 3: includes financial instruments that have objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date. This stage has obligors that already are impaired (defaulted).

The assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL should be unbiased and probability-weighted and would incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL would take into account the time value of money.

Based on the requirements of the Standard and SBP’s Application Instructions, the Holding Company has performed an ECL assessment considering the key elements such as assessment of Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR), Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD). These elements are described below:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default, calibrated over the 12 months from the reporting date (stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (stage 2) and incorporating forward looking information.
- LGD: It is an estimate of magnitude of loss sustained on any facility upon default by a customer. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor. It is the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Holding Company expects to receive, including any form of collateral.
- EAD: the expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.

# Measurement of ECL

ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:

- financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Holding Company expects to receive);
- financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows;
- undrawn financing commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Holding Company if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Holding Company expects to receive; and

# Restructured financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognized and ECL are measured as follows:

- if the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the

expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset.

- if the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective yield rate of the existing financial asset.

# Non-Performing financial assets

At each reporting date, the Holding Company assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI are credit-impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘non-performing’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

## Chunk 177


# Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- the restructuring of a financing by the Holding Company on terms that the Holding Company would not consider otherwise;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

A financing that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail financing that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.

Under the IFRS 9 Application instructions, the Holding Company is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. The Holding Company is required to calculate ECL on its non-performing financial assets as higher of provision under Prudential Regulations (PR) or ECL under IFRS 9.

The Holding Company calculates the ECL against corporate, commercial & SME financing portfolios as higher of PR or ECL under IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level, whereas against the retail borrowers the Holding Company will calculate ECL at higher of PR or ECL under IFRS 9 at segment / product basis as instructed under Annexure-A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024.

For the purpose of calculation of ECL, the Holding Company has used 10 years’ data till 31 December 2023.

# 3.1.8 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Holding Company uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

Under the SBP’s instructions, credit exposure (in local currency) guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Moreover, until implementation of the Standard has stabilized, Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions would be made as per the Standard’s ECL criteria and Stage 3 provisions would be made considering higher of the Standard’s ECL or provision computed under existing requirements of Prudential Regulations (PRs) issued by SBP on a segment basis for retail financing and ORR obligor basis for corporate / commercial / SME portfolio.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PRs. Financial assets in Stage 2 may be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum cooling period of 3 months / 3 installments (whichever is last) is required before any financial asset is moved back to Stage 1. Any upgrading from stage 3 to stage 2 must be subject to a cooling off period of as per prudential regulations. If the facility has been regular during the cooling off period, it will move back to Stage 2 after which the criteria for moving from Stage 2 to Stage 1 will apply. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022.

The Holding Company will not rebut the 30 DPD presumption as a key SICR criterion. The Holding Company may override the criteria supported by reasonable evidence on a case by case basis. This includes:

- Cases of technical delinquencies (for example, accounts marked as DPD 30+ owing to administrative reasons and not credit related concerns; or cases where there is no dispute regarding payment amount).
- Cases of delinquencies where payments on facilities are linked to government payments causing such delinquencies.

However, any such specific override will require approval from Chief Risk Officer.

The Holding Company measures ECL on a lifetime basis for Purchased or originated credit - Impaired (POCI) instruments throughout the life of the instrument. However, ECL is not recognised in a separate loss provision on initial recognition for POCI instruments as the lifetime expected credit loss is inherent within the gross carrying amount of the instruments. The Holding Company recognises the change in lifetime expected credit.

losses arising subsequent to initial recognition in the profit and loss account and the cumulative change as a loss provision. Where lifetime ECL on POCI instruments are less than those at initial recognition, then the favorable differences are recognised as impairment gains in the statement of profit and loss.

Undrawn financing commitments and guarantees:

‘Financial guarantees’ are contracts that require the Holding Company to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. ‘Financing commitments’ are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions.

Financial guarantees issued or commitments to provide a financing at a below-market profit rate are initially measured at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at the higher of the loss allowance determined in accordance with IFRS 9 and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.

When estimating lifetime ECL for undrawn financings commitments, the Holding Company estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the financings are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

# 3.1.9 Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Holding Company has adopted a governance framework requiring the Risk, Finance, Operations, Internal Audit and IT functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. IFRS 9 requires robust credit risk models that can predict Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD).

The Holding Company’s Risk Management Department has developed models / methodologies for PD, LGD and Credit Conversion Factors (CCF). These models shall be validated on annual basis considering the following aspects:

- Quantitative Validation: ECL model design validation, data quality validation and benchmarking with external best practices.
- Quantitative Validation: Calibration testing which ensures the accuracy of the observed PDs.

The Risk Department will define the staging criteria for the new impairment model and take ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach. Additionally, the Risk department will also take the ownership of the impact of ECL on Holding Company’s capital.

The Holding Company’s Finance Department will perform ECL calculation. As a result, the department will then assess the financial impact, meet the financial reporting requirements and further monitor the impact on the financial ratios. Risk Management Department shall also present quarterly progress report to its Board Risk Management Committee.

The IT Department shall identify, prepare and extract the data required for the risk parameters modelling and ECL calculations. IT department shall also support project owners for system development and upgrades.

|The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity or investments in associates and subsidiary, is based on quoted market price.

The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiary, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.| | | | |
|The fair value of unquoted Shariah compliant securities, fixed term financing, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.| | | | |
