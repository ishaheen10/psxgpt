# President and CEO’s Message

26 | ANNUAL REPORT 2024

I am pleased to announce that 2024 was a year in which we achieved significant milestones by focusing on growth supported by our firm foundation of innovation and customer-centricity. Our dedication has driven our performance and reinforced our position as a leading financial institution in Pakistan.

In our lending strategy, we will emphasise consumer lending more strongly while simultaneously expanding our support for small and medium enterprises and increasing loans in the agriculture sector. Additionally, we aim to grow our investment banking by scaling both onshore and offshore operations and advancing green finance initiatives.

Throughout 2024, our relentless commitment drove us to record profitability, backed by robust performance. We witnessed a remarkable 72% increase in market capitalisation, reaching approximately USD 500 million (PKR 131 billion). This exceptional growth has positioned us among the top ten best-performing stocks in the Asia Pacific region for 2024, as recognised by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Furthermore, we are delighted to announce that Bank Alfalah's credit rating was elevated to ‘AAA’ by the Pakistan Credit Rating Agency (PACRA). This achievement underscores our solid financial foundation and dedication to excellence.

Our commitment extends beyond banking. We collaborate with public, private, and civil society stakeholders, reinforcing our role as the ‘Caring Bank’ and contributing towards a sustainable way forward, focusing on economic, social, and environmental capital.

We also proudly secured two prestigious Pakistan Banking Awards. We have been the Best Bank for Digital Excellence for the third consecutive time, and Best Bank for Customer Engagement for the sixth time. These accolades highlight our commitment to innovation and exceptional customer service.

Last year, Bank Alfalah demonstrated a continued commitment to flood-affected communities with PKR 2.1 billion in disbursements since 2022, positioning itself as one of the most significant corporate contributors to fostering a sustainable future for flood-impacted communities.

Now that the economic landscape stabilises, it presents both opportunities and challenges for the industry. Reduction in policy rates and stabilisation of the Pakistani Rupee has decreased inflation and foreign exchange volatility. However, increased taxation on the banking sector will further pressurise our profitability. Additionally, as money supply growth rises due to lower interest rates, we expect a slowdown in deposit growth, which must be managed strategically. These macroeconomic factors require us to adapt strategically to sustain our financial performance.

As we enter 2025, our vision surpasses our current accomplishments, driving us to explore new opportunities, expand our footprint, and enhance our impact on communities. With our steadfast commitment to excellence, we eagerly look forward to the next chapter of our journey, where our approach to banking stands as a beacon of financial empowerment.

Wishing you and your loved ones a prosperous 2025.

We are strategising a strong deposit strategy where the focus is to shift from period-end deposit balances to average balances and drive growth throughput by deepening our customer relationships. We will also leverage trade flows to enhance deposit growth and expand our remittance base.

While we continue to expand and upgrade our over 1,000-branch network, we are also investing in digitising operations to ensure faster, more seamless transactions for our customers. By integrating advanced technologies, we reinforce our promise of a customer-centric experience while maintaining the personal touch and financial advisory that distinguish us.

The video on the Bank’s overview, business performance, strategy and outlook is uploaded on the website.

# Economic Review

# Global Economy

The tight monetary policy stance adopted by global central banks has curbed inflationary pressures. IMF anticipates global inflation to come down from an average of 6.7% in 2023 to 5.7% in 2024 and subsequently to 4.2% in 2025. The fears of recession have largely subsided, IMF expects global growth to remain at 3.2% in 2024 as compared to 3.3% 2025. Most asset classes sustained their positive performance from 2023 into 2024.

In 2024, the policy focus predominantly centered around monetary aspects whereas, in 2025, attention is expected to lean towards fiscal policies, with significant changes anticipated in tariffs and taxation, driven by newly elected governments in key global economies, particularly in the United States. Additionally, ongoing geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine will remain critical towards influencing global economic stability. Central banks worldwide will closely monitor these fiscal and geopolitical developments in shaping their monetary policies.

# Uncertainties that could affect the Bank’s resources, revenues and operations

and guidance. At the same time, we would like to acknowledge the ongoing support of our shareholders, our customers and business partners.

- Impact of climate conditions on economic activity and business operations;
- Geopolitical risks and uncertainties across the geographies where we operate;
- Global AML/CFT compliance in accordance with FATF;

- Economic decisions on discount rate/monetary policy;
- Changes in fiscal policy and corporate taxation measures;
- Law and order situation/political environment within the country;
- Local government rules and regulations;
- Emergence of disruptive technologies; and
- Risk of cyberattacks.

The Risk Management Group of the Bank routinely performs stress tests based on various pre-determined scenarios to assess the potential impact of losses and to determine whether the Bank has adequate capital to withstand repercussions of any adverse events. The results of these tests indicate that the Bank is maintaining sufficient capital, liquidity, and profitability to absorb potential losses.

The Bank vigilantly monitors these uncertainties and risks, and simultaneously implements corrective and protective measures to sustain operating performance and safeguard shareholder interests.

A detailed overview is given in the ‘Outlook’ and ‘Strategy’ sections of this Annual Report.

# Voice Biometrics

Voice biometrics is a deep fake proof technology that identifies a person by their voice, similar to how fingerprints and facial recognition work. Each person’s voice is unique, and our system can recognize over 100 different characteristics in a person’s voice. This makes it nearly impossible for someone else to imitate. When a customer calls, they no longer need to remember pins or answer difficult security questions or be duped by social engineering fraudsters. They simply speak, and the system confirms their identity quickly and easily. This is a passive voice bio system, which verifies a person through natural language processing as opposed to saying a specific phrase which is prone to deep fake voice emulation.

# Suppliers, Service Providers and Vendors

Bank Alfalah considers suppliers at every stage of the product lifecycle as they have a significant role in providing end-to-end services, ranging from sourcing raw materials to help ramping up production and finding better options for the organisations. When the market starts becoming saturated, companies need to work closely with their suppliers to get the best out of their products for fulfilling their requirements. The goal of suppliers is to ensure that they meet or exceed the buyer's expectations in terms of quality, delivery, and cost. There are many benefits of effective supplier management, including improved quality and delivery of goods and services, reduced costs, and strategic relationships with suppliers.

# Bank Alfalah Culture Strategy

The Bank Alfalah Culture Strategy rests on the following pillars:

- One Bank, One Team
- Focus on Customers
- Inspiring and Empowering the People

The Bank’s Values are a sub-category of the Culture, with which all the employees are mandated to align themselves:

- You (Customer Care)
- Your Needs (Collaboration)
- Your Way (Creativity and Innovation)
- The Right Way (Conduct and Integrity)

Bank Alfalah has clearly defined four core values that are integral to its organisational culture. These values are accompanied by specific behaviors and competencies that guide employees in embodying them. By understanding and practicing these values, personnel are able to develop a holistic understanding of their significance and their role in shaping the culture of the Bank. When employees align with these values, they contribute to fostering a positive and inclusive culture. This alignment creates a workplace that is conducive to the success and well-being of all employees, regardless of age, race, religion, gender, ability, or any other individual characteristics.

All initiatives proposed are a product of the feedback received from the employees themselves, and as a result have a direct impact on the business, behavior of the staff, and customer loyalty. Culture has been inculcated into the Bank’s overarching 5-year strategy, evidencing the senior management’s commitment towards ensuring a positive experience and environment for all employees.

|79,010|163,454|
|---|---|
|2023|2024|

In 2024, the Bank received 163,454 complaints, achieving an impressive average resolution time of 4.3 working days.

In line with the Employee Happiness Charter to extend opportunities to learn and grow, learning interventions were offered virtually as well as in person. Training interventions and e-Learning modules were offered in various disciplines. Given below is a glimpse of learning quantum during the last 6 years:

|Number of training programs (in person)| |2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|2024|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|992|1,532|1,251|1,004|1,102|1,466| | |

|Number of participants|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|2024| |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | |105,621|152,148|189,302|306,882|32,288|53,988|

The Banks extended focus remained on capacity-building in line with regulatory frameworks and global compliance obligations, with several initiatives undertaken in this regard. With the help of in-house and external subject-matter experts, various learning programs were arranged on Anti-Money Laundering, TF Risk Assessment, and CFT Obligations, Trade-Based Money Laundering and Cyber Security Awareness. Realising contemporary trends and future-proofing the employees, learning initiatives have been taken to increase their digital quotient. Frontline teams were upskilled in product and process knowledge, and enhanced levels of customer service.

In line with the Bank's strategy to create a client-focused culture, Bank Alfalah launched its Customer Loyalty Programme, "At Your Service 2.0," this year. The program aims to enable staff to become loyalty leaders by embodying three essential behaviors: Empathy, Responsibility, and Generosity, whether interacting with external or internal customers. The Learning and Development team devised a comprehensive training plan to ensure that the entire workforce, including senior officials, undergoes this program. In 2024, over 90% of Bank staff attended this program.

Carrying forward the momentum from the year before, 2024 remained an exceptional year for learning and development. The year witnessed a digital transformation of learning methodologies, revamping the physical learning spaces. From virtual infrastructure up-gradation to extending innovative learning opportunities, the Learning Division made concerted efforts to equip employees with the best skill-set, enabling them to discover new and better ways to serve the customers.

To upskill Premier Banking Staff, the Bank Alfalah Learning team devised a comprehensive Premier Banking Bootcamp. This tailored program is meticulously designed to elevate investment product knowledge and enhance financial market understanding among premier staff. The training content encourages participants to think creatively and propose scenario-based wealth and investment plans according to client needs. Premier Boot Camps were conducted across the country, and the first cohort of Relationship Managers (RMs) have successfully graduated.

Through this Premier Banking certification, Premier RMs were trained and assessed on Product Knowledge, Control and Compliance, ensuring a high standard of service to clients. The Learning team is steadfast in its commitment to continuous upskilling and empowering staff to operate at their fullest potential, enthusiastic about propelling this initiative to the next level.

The project aims to empower and equip women at the grassroots level with the necessary tools to strengthen themselves in a formidable position at the workplace. The Learning team devised a customised training program for junior and mid-level female staff to upskill them and enhance their capabilities for career progression, empowering them to capitalise on their leadership abilities.

A skill gap analysis was conducted, and customised learning modules were introduced to develop cognitive thinking and socio-emotional skills, breaking internal bias to lead their career progression. This was followed by 1-1 coaching sessions with designated mentors, who would meet with targeted female staff at a set frequency, assessing their progress on the goals set during and post-completion of programs, and creating visibility in front of stakeholders. Human Capital Group (HCG) developed a talent pool of females who went through this program and kept track of their progress via nominated coaches. HCG Business partners played a pivotal role in sharing career opportunities within the Bank and prioritising them for internal elevations based on expertise.

# Questions asked by the shareholders in the meeting:

- A shareholder appreciated the overall results of the Bank and enquired about CASA for the last year. He also commented that the growth in advances is relatively low and asked about the future strategy for the same. He commented that the advances against personal finances is risky. The CFO replied that the low advances growth was due to a very tough economic environment. Due to the high interest rate, the advances demand was impacted. Therefore, we have been very cautious in extending advances. The CFO further said that CASA ratio at Dec end was 69.3%.
- Another question was about the deposit market share of the Bank in Islamic banking. The CFO said that the Islamic deposit market share of the Bank is 5.3%.
- A shareholder appreciated the Management for the good financial results as well as the dividends and expressed his wishes for higher profitability in the coming years. The CEO and CFO thanked him for good wishes.
- A shareholder commented that the Bank's growth in the year 2023 was excellent, but the cash dividend to the shareholders should be much higher than what has been announced. The CFO said that the dividends are declared by the Board based on the profitability, capital adequacy and future plans.
- Another question was whether the bank would continue to focus on opening new branches in 2024 despite economic uncertainty in the country. The CEO replied that opening of new branches is part of the Bank’s strategy to grow the market share. He added that at present the interest rate is high and this will help to enhance Bank’s deposits and profits.

A Shareholder commented that the dividend being paid to shareholders is good, however, it should have been increased. He enquired about the detail of derivative income, whether this income comes every year or it is retrospective. The CFO replied that the detail of the derivative income is provided in the Note No. 22 of the Annual Report 2023. Usually the derivative transactions are dependent on customer requirement which vary from year to year as they are done to provide hedge to customers. It can be profitable or vice versa depending on the currency movement.

One shareholder enquired about the future outlook and strategy of the Bank in the coming years. The CEO replied that the current year would be about economic consolidation. In view of the IMF program, we expect that there will be some tightening in the economy. The inflation pressure may be coming down if the interest rate starts decreasing. He added that the decline in the interest rate will put pressure on our spreads, however, it will be compensated by the growth in volumes. The CEO said that we will try to continue our growth and deposit pace.

Another shareholder appreciated the Management for good results and expressed his wishes for higher profitability in the coming years. The CEO thanked him for good wishes.

The meeting concluded with a vote of thanks to the Chair by the Company Secretary.

# Suppliers, Service Providers and Vendors/Outsourcing Arrangements

Furthermore, Bank Alfalah's dedication to fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion is exemplified in its vendor enlistment strategy, showcasing significant advancements. Vendors need to be managed effectively to reduce the risk of supply chain disruption and ensure that the goods and services provided are delivered on time and as per the expected standard. Beyond this, an effective vendor management process helps the Bank build stronger relationships with its vendors which may, in turn, lead to opportunities to negotiate better rates.

The Bank has a Board approved Procurement Policy. This policy establishes procurement standards, which are primarily based on three pillars, i.e. Integrity, Transparency, and Accountability. These pillars are applied to all activities before awarding any contract/business including contracts for capital expenditure, i.e. purchases or construction work. Decision-making criteria at all stages are clear, justifiable, and objective (with a written record where needed) with no room for discretion at any time, especially in the evaluation and comparison of bids.

Through this policy, the Bank achieves the following objectives:

- Improve vendor selection
- Harness cost savings
- Speed-up vendor onboarding
- Reduce the risk of supply chain disruption
- Strengthen supplier relationships
- Negotiate better rates

# Analysts and Credit Rating Agencies

Credit rating agencies provide value for investors and market participants by rating the creditworthiness and ability of the Bank to repay its credit and debt obligations. By providing a rating, credit rating agencies put different entities on an equal footing, providing a comparable rating for different types of entities and different types of bonds. A credit rating takes into account many factors, including the financial health of the entity, cash flows, lien priority, entity governance, history of debt repayment, bond term, and future economic outlook relevant to the entity.

The Bank engages with PACRA for entity and instrument ratings. The credit rating is updated on an annual basis and the rating report is submitted to the State Bank of Pakistan and made public within the regulatory period after the notification of the rating by the credit rating agency. Furthermore, the Bank discloses its credit rating prominently in its published annual and quarterly financial statements, and on its website.

The Bank also engages with analysts through quarterly investor calls / corporate briefings. The purpose of these sessions is to maintain transparency over the Bank's results and performance.

# Methods and Assumptions used in Compiling Key Performance Indicators

Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are the metrics utilised by the management to measure performance against strategic objectives. KPIs are designed carefully keeping in view quantitative and qualitative aspects.

Quantitative aspects relate to the Bank's financial base, ability to generate funds, deployment of funds in the most profitable avenues, profitability, market share, growth in share price, value addition over the book price of shares, adequacy of capital, and liquidity.

Qualitative aspects relate to customer and investor confidence, brand identity and loyalty, innovation, employee confidence, data security, strategic partnerships, and risk management.

KPIs are continually reviewed and worked upon by the management of the Bank. They are analysed, correlated with the external environment, and aligned with factors affecting the Bank's strategies and performance. They are visibly communicated and followed, in line with the strategy of the Bank. KPIs are compiled and discussed on a regular basis in management meetings and board presentations.

# Methods in Compiling Indicators

# Quantitative KPIs

- Market share: The Bank focuses on gaining market share in deposits, advances, trade, remittances and government initiatives such as RDA. The growing share reflects the trust of customers in the Bank and is an indication of customers' preference to choose Bank Alfalah as the preferred transaction bank. The Bank constantly assesses this indicator through a comparative analysis of the volumes of peers, in order to grow and decide on various growth strategies.
- Share price and value addition over the book value of the share: This is a measure of shareholders' and investors' confidence in the Bank's performance. The Bank monitors this KPI closely and aligns its financial performance to build momentum in investor confidence.
- Profitability: The main elements of profitability, markup income and non-fund based revenue, are derived from effective balance sheet management, high earning assets and a sound deposit level. Furthermore, while the costs of doing business mainly due to investment in IT & Digital infrastructures may go up, the Bank willingly incurs such costs without compromising on profitable ventures. The Bank controls and manages the costs of driving sound profitability and evaluates its profitability levels (Earnings Per Share) in order to maximise shareholder return and ensure sustainable returns.
- Dividend payouts: Sustainable dividends are at the forefront of the Bank's strategy with a view of maximising shareholders' long-term returns. The Bank will continue to prioritise a consistent and healthy dividend payout over the coming years.
- Capital adequacy and liquidity ratios: Maintaining capital well above the regulatory capital adequacy limits (including buffers) and strong liquidity ratios indicate the Bank's sound financial footing. These are calculated based on various regulatory instructions. The Bank keeps a check and balance on these ratios and does not deviate from regulatory requirements.
- Ability to generate funds: The Bank had successfully generated funds through a Medium Term Note and multiple ADT-1 instruments. These reflect institutional investors' confidence in the soundness of the Bank's balance sheet, efficient liquidity management, and the Bank's ability to repay debts.

# Share Capital and Equity

Shareholders' equity represents the capital commitments of shareholders and investors. Such funding entitles them to income distribution, liquidation and voting privileges. Several regulatory ratios and requirements such as CAR are based on the shareholder's capital. Share capital, being an expensive source, is raised for strategic activities like expansion, acquisitions and mergers, and to meet regulatory requirements.

# Risk Management Methodology

Bank Alfalah implements its risk strategy and engages in controlled risk-taking within its risk management framework. The risk management methodology defines the optimal course of action amid uncertainty by identifying, owning, mitigating, reporting and validating risk in line with its long-term objective of maximising shareholder value and ensuring sustainable returns. The Bank adheres to an integrated, structured and disciplined approach, realised through the implementation of effective and efficient risk management methodologies and policies that align strategies, processes, people, technology and knowledge to assess, evaluate and manage uncertainties that the Bank faces as it creates value.

The methodology contains the following activities:

- Developing and implementing an enterprise risk management framework across all business groups in the country and locations outside the country;
- Identifying risks and maintaining risk exposure within the risk appetite of the stakeholders;
- Optimising resources in order to enhance value for shareholders;
- Establishing risk tolerance limits /risk appetite;
- Ensuring availability of sufficient capital as a buffer to absorb risks gauged through self-risk assessment as well as under the purview of regulatory guidelines; and
- Aligning risk management approach with regulatory and future business requirements.

154 | ANNUAL REPORT 2024

An effective risk management framework along with a robust risk governance structure, strong capital, liquidity, market risk, compliance / money laundering and good quality of the credit portfolio, remain the cornerstones for the Bank’s risk management methodology.

# Risk Appetite

Risk Appetite (RA) refers to the maximum threshold of risks level that the bank is willing to undertake in implementing its strategic and business objectives set by the Board of Directors. In setting the RA, including tolerance and limits, the Bank’s resources including capital are allocated effectively and risk limits are set to remain within the boundaries of risk framework. RA strikes a balance between strategy, growth aspirations, operating plans, capital and risks that the bank deems material, based on their significance and regulatory requirements. The Risk Management Division of the Bank devises risk appetite every year which is then approved by the Board considering the Business plans and macro economic environment. The Bank’s RA is reviewed considering historical trend, regulatory requirements, stress test results and senior management’s views about economic situations versus the business objectives. Furthermore, to enhance the dynamism of the Risk Appetite framework, various economic zones have been defined based on the country risk matrix, with distinct tolerance thresholds and limits assigned to each zone for key risk parameters. Application of the RA and its monitoring helps to ensure the Bank stays within appropriate risk boundaries.

# Functions of Risk Appetite:

- Banks willingness to take a risk
- Internal (Soft) Risk Tolerance Limit
- Monitoring Risk strategies and approaches to mitigate risk
- Putting the Bank’s risk capacity in best use

# Risk Monitoring and Reporting

- Reporting to Board and Board’s Risk Management Committee (BRMC): Meetings of the Board and BRMC take place on a quarterly basis, at minimum. The agenda consists of various risk related analysis & decisions that are based on business needs and situations including, but not limited to, macro-economic environment.
- Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP): The report covers risk areas like documentation lapses, concentration, liquidity, reputation, environmental, settlement, core risk etc. This is finally reported to Board.
- ICAAP reporting is based on bank’s own assessment of risks and calculating the adequate amount of capital that bank is required to maintain against those risks.
- The purpose of the ICAAP is to inform the Board of the ongoing assessment of the bank’s risks, how the Bank intends to mitigate those risks and how much current and future capital is necessary having considered other mitigating factors.
- ICAAP exercise attempts to assess the risk based capital as opposed to regulatory capital, which is generally not considered the complete reflection of the embedded risks; given that regulatory capital does not account for Pillar II risks and additional capital required in lieu of stress testing for pillar 1 risks.
- Management / SBP’s monitoring: Various reports are submitted to Senior Management / SBP covering risk aspects such as credit risk. The regulator conducts inspections to monitor bank’s approach towards risk mitigation and compliance against the breaches, if any.
- Stress Testing: Bank Alfalah prepares and submits Scenario Analysis Stress Testing reports to SBP. The same are reviewed by Senior Management & Board as well. The report mainly encompasses Statistical Models based on Macro Economic Variables Risk Management Tools (i.e. VAR, SVAR), Reverse Stress Testing. Furthermore, MST Framework proposes a multilayered approach for Stress Testing Model development, validation, approval and implementation; along with the identification of stakeholders for validation, control & oversight perspective. Results of the exercise are used to calibrate risk appetite, Annual Business Plans, Capital and Contingency Planning.
- Risk Register: This is an effective tool for comprehensive risk management for identifying key business and financial risks. Further, it defines the implementation of respective controls and mitigating factors to reduce the risks identified. Risk and Compliance Divisions review risk registers based on the reports provided by the business line managers, suggest the mitigation measures to the concerned units, and also submit their assessment of the effectiveness of the mitigation measures to BRMC on a quarterly basis. The minimum components of the risk register are: date, risk identification number, risk description, controls, consequences, likelihood, overall risk score, risk ranking, trigger, management action and risk owners.
- Standards and Limits: The Bank follows Basel guidelines for capital adequacy monitoring. Further, there are various circulars from SBP in this regard. The bank ensures strict compliance with these standards, internal and regulatory limits as well as guidelines laid down in the circulars.
- Policies, Procedures, Manuals and SOPs: The Bank has well established policies and other documentary guidelines for every product and process. These serve as guidelines and monitoring tools for the staff performing various risk related activities. All relevant departments are responsible for ensuring compliance with documents.
- Business Resilience and Continuity Plan: The Business Resilience Plan tends to define the business continuity & recovery strategies and procedures. Business Resilience and Business Continuity are at times used as alternate terms to align continuity of operations due to, or during, any disruption. For further details on policy, refer to the Governance section of this Annual Report.
- Contingency Funding Plan (CFP): The Bank prepares an annual CFP which covers the funding plans should a triggering event materialise. Refer to the Liquidity Management subsection within this section of the Annual Report.

# Recovery Plan

The Bank prepares a comprehensive recovery plan in line with enhanced supervisory requirements under Domestic Systematically Important Bank (D-SIB) framework by State Bank of Pakistan. The plan incorporates the Bank’s critical systems vis-à-vis their impact on core business lines and critical functions as identified in approved Business Resilience Plan. Key trigger events & funding resources available to Bank are identified, in line with ALCO approved Contingency Funding Plan, in order to combat severe stress situations related to funding liquidity. The context behind the Recovery Plan is based on the assumption that the Bank’s Capital and/or liquidity are in breach of the identified recovery thresholds as per the approved risk appetite. Key assumptions taken into account while preparing the Recovery Plan include:

- Materiality, Feasibility & Timelines for implementation of Recovery Options.
- Raising of Capital / Liquidity, Market and/or Regulator, in a timely and cost effective manner
- Expense rationalization.

The Risk Culture within the Bank supports its business objectives and fosters an environment that enables management to execute the business strategy more efficiently and sustainably. The Board of Directors regularly reviews the risk profile of the Bank and makes every senior leader a responsible stakeholder in developing a strong risk culture within the Bank. Further, the Bank ensures that each employee comprehensively understands the responsibilities concerning the risks they undertake at each stage in their regular business activities. The Bank has established a risk management framework that incorporates a risk management structure consisting of various sub-committees. It includes clearly defined reporting lines to ensure the independent operation of risk management functions. Risk governance of the Bank also includes setting the risk appetite statement, risk limits, risk management functions, capital planning, risk management policies, risk infrastructure and MIS and analysis to monitor the Bank’s risk profile.

# Risk Assessment

Board’s efforts to determine the level of risk tolerance

The Board of Directors is the ultimate governing body responsible for overseeing risk management to maximise shareholders’ returns. It ensures that the required culture, practices and systems are in place to address the risks faced by the Bank. Under the valuable guidance of the Board, the Bank ensures a proactive approach in dealing with factors that influence its financial position, strives to maintain stable earnings, and attempts to maximise shareholders’ value by achieving an appropriate balance between risk and return.

The Board:

- Has established a bank-wide strategy incorporating the risk management strategy;
- Has approved the overall risk appetite, tolerance levels and level of adequate capital; and
- Regularly reviews any significant risk issues to determine their impact on the Bank’s strategy, aligning the strategy to address existing or potential risks.

The Board, through its Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC), has delegated oversight responsibilities. BRMC ensures the formulation and implementation of a comprehensive risk management framework. Under the Board’s guidance, the Bank executed an effective risk strategy and continued controlled risk-taking activities within the risk management framework, combining core policies, procedures, and process design with active portfolio management.

The Board Risk Management Committee:

- Establishes and reviews compliance with the Risk Management framework;
- Ensures that the Bank's overall risk exposure is maintained at prudent levels and is consistent with available capital;
- Reviews and recommends to the Board, the risk appetite of the Bank; and
- Reviews risk management information reports, identifies exceptions, and provides guidance for corrective measures.

The functional and day-to-day management responsibilities have been delegated to the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). In line with this, the CRO functionally reports to the President and CEO. The roles and responsibilities are designed to ensure that risk is governed and managed independently and prudently.

The Board, through its Risk Management Committee, has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Bank, including those that could threaten the business model, future performance, and solvency or liquidity. Below are the key risks, which arise as a result of external factors affecting the organisation and they have an impact on the availability, quality, and affordability of the capital:

|Factors|Risks|
|---|---|
|Macroeconomic|Credit Risk, Market Risk, Liquidity Risk|
|Legal|Legal Risk, Compliance Risk (including Money Laundering), Operational Risk, Country Risk|
|Political|Operational Risk, Country Risk|
|Technological|Model Risk, Operational Risk, Information Security Risk|

# The Risk Assessment has been done for the following:

- Business model: Potential risks facing the Bank’s business model which in turn affect the survival of the Bank. Sound business growth with managed risk is crucial for operations. The Bank considers expected level of profitability, market reputation, experienced personnel, logistic support, etc for business model. Relevant risks can be credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, model risk, reputational risk and concentration risk.
- Future performance: Technological obsolescence and inability to cope with recent technological developments can also threaten the existence. Further, the situations of the country/region where the Bank operates also cause impacts and is a necessary factor for consideration in risk assessment. The Bank considers reputation, ability to meet stakeholders expectations, capital adequacy, macro and microeconomic scenarios, risk management practices for its future performance. Relevant risks could be information security risk, environmental risk and legal risk.
- Liquidity: The ability to operate with sufficient funds to meet depositors’ obligations is key to operating as a bank. Further, this also includes fulfilling regulatory requirements set by the regulator, hence, compliance plays an important role in this regard. The Bank considers fundamentals like maintaining adequate capital, liquidity and operational control at all times in order to safeguard the interests of depositors, borrowers, shareholders and other stakeholders and meet its obligations against these. Relevant risks could be liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk and compliance risk.
- Other key focus areas are:
- Build a risk culture
- Financial crime and economic vulnerability
- Client risk rating focus
- Regulatory compliance
- Information and Cyber Security
- New technologies
- Environment, Social & Governance (ESG)
- Business resilience

The risk management and mitigation strategy is therefore fundamentally based on maintaining adequate capital, liquidity, and operational control at all times in order to safeguard the interests of depositors, borrowers, shareholders and other stakeholders.

# Key Risks

|TYPES OF RISKS|LIKELIHOOD|MATERIALITY|
|---|---|---|
|Credit Risk|High|High|

It means the possibility of monetary loss to financial institutions arising due to the inability or unwillingness of a counterparty to perform a commitment per the agreed terms and conditions, among other things, on account of lending, trading, hedging, settlement, and other financial transactions.

Source: External

Impact: Financial

Capital Affected: Financial Capital

Assessment tools: Risk Ratings, Stress Testing, limit monitoring, exception monitoring and delinquency ratio.

Mitigation Strategy: The Bank is committed to the appropriate level of due diligence to ensure that credit risk is identified and analysed diligently, ensuring that credit commitments are appropriately structured, priced (in line with market practices), and documented. Bank Alfalah has a Credit Operational Manual (COM) and a Credit Policy Manual (CPM) in place to strategise and govern the Bank’s overall lending strategy. Furthermore, the Bank has an internal Credit Initiation and Risk Rating System through which risk levels are assessed based on customers’ risk profiles. Bank Alfalah has adopted IFRS-9 effective from 01 January 2024 to measure and assess changes in credit risk as per SBP Application Instructions of IFRS 9. The timely recognition of and provision for credit losses promote a safe banking system and play an essential role in supervision. Furthermore, the portfolios and well-defined parameters are actively reviewed, and, if required, corrective actions are taken at a nascent stage.

Credit Concentration Risk
Medium
Medium
It is the risk which results from inadequate diversification of the Bank’s credit portfolio in terms of industries, regions or number of counterparties that may result in significant losses.

Source: Internal and External

Impact: Financial

Capital Affected: Financial Capital

Assessment tools: Limits monitoring including Sectors, Tenors and Risk Weighted Assets.

Mitigation Strategy: The SBP has prescribed regulatory limits for banks’ maximum exposure to single and group obligors. Moreover, to restrict industry concentration risk, the Bank’s annual credit plan spells out the maximum allowable exposure that it can take on specific industries. The Bank manages and monitors its portfolio of loan assets and limits for high-risk customers. Limit concentrations are monitored in terms of risk quality, industry, maturity, and large exposure.

Operational Risk
Medium
Medium
It is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate internal processes, people and systems, or from external events including legal risks. This excludes strategic and reputational risk.

Source: Internal and External

Impact: Financial/Non-Financial

Capital Affected: Financial, Social, Human and Intellectual Capital

Assessment tools: Risk Control Self Assessment, Operational losses viz-a-viz tolerance limit and Key Risk Indicators breaches.

Mitigation Strategy: Embedding a sustainable risk culture remains our core objective, which includes effective management of operational issues and emerging risks across the Bank and in our overseas operations via deployment of required resources, tools and continuous supervision. The new Operational Risk Framework, Policy and Standards, duly approved by the Board, have been rolled out, along with new system platforms (Operational Risk System), for recording and tracking of risk events, including non-financial risks. We aim to implement a new process based Risk and Control Self-Assessment method across the Bank in order to effectively manage operational risks and continually monitor the effectiveness of defined controls through first-line self-assessment reviews, especially for the processes and activities that may significantly impact the Bank’s risk appetite. Furthermore, new and amended products, systems, activities and processes are subject to comprehensive operational risk assessments before implementation and launch.

# TYPES OF RISKS

|Risk Type|Likelihood|Materiality|
|---|---|---|
|Market Risk|High|High|

It is the risk arising from changes in the value of on and off-balance sheet positions of the Bank due to adverse
movements in market rates or prices such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads and
commodity prices, resulting in a loss to earnings and capital. Due to the external nature of the risk, and given the
prevalent macro-economic environment, the likelihood of adverse price movements is currently high. However,
stringent controls are in place to mitigate any material impact on profitability and capital. This risk includes Interest
rate risk, Equity price risk, Foreign Exchange risk and Commodity risk.

Impact: Financial

Capital Affected: Financial Capital

Assessment tools: Investment Limits, Exposure Limits and Sensitivity Analysis, Tolerance Limits, Duration & PV 01 Limits

Mitigation Strategy: The Market and Liquidity Risk Department monitors the impact of price and rate movements on
the Bank’s portfolios and periodically reports to the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) and Investment Committee
(IC), which are primarily responsible for oversight of market risk. The Bank has developed various tools for risk
measurement and its mitigation thereof, including Value at Risk (VaR), Duration, Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP) and
Re-pricing Gaps. In addition, the Bank carries out stress tests, using both internally developed scenarios and scenarios
prescribed by the regulator. Moreover, the Bank has a comprehensive risk control limit framework, which defines
exposure limits (for each portfolio, issuer, tenor, rating and sector), PVBP limits, money market gap limits, FX gap
limits, currency-wise NOP limits, stop loss limits, tolerance limits, counterparty limits, dealer limits, and broker limits.
The Bank uses a standardized approach to calculate market risk capital charge under the Basel framework.

Liquidity Risk

Capital Affected: Financial and Reputational Capital (franchise value)

Assessment tools: Stress Testing, Advances to Deposits Ratio, Stable Funding Ratio, Statutory Liquidity Reserve Ratio,
Liquidity Coverage Ratio, Deposit Concentration Limits, Liquid Assets to Liquid Liability ratio and Maturity Gaps.

Mitigation Strategy: The Market and Liquidity Risk Department performs independent monitoring and reporting of the
overall liquidity position in line with regulatory requirements and the Bank’s own risk appetite at the Bank and operations
level. The Bank is fully compliant with Basel III liquidity standards, Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding
Ratio (NSFR), with a considerable cushion over the regulatory requirement. Stress Tests are performed (both SBP and
internal for all operations and at the Bank level) under which liquidity risk factors are given major shocks to check the
vulnerability of the Bank’s balance sheet to those hypothetical shocks in various stress scenarios.

Model Risk
Medium
High

The potential loss the Bank may incur, as a consequence of decisions that could be principally based on the output of
models, due to errors in the development, implementation, or use of such models.

Assessment tools: Annual Validation exercise.

Mitigation Strategy: Risk management is involved in periodic review of model accuracy and validation. A conservative
approach, validation based on sensitivity analyses, the use of subjective elements, and ongoing monitoring of the model’s
performance provide sufficient protection against such unfavorable impacts.

In November 2022, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) issued Environmental & Social Risk Management (ESRM) Implementation Manual, based on IFC performance standards, which is applicable to all banks in Pakistan. During 2023, Bank Alfalah has aligned its Green Banking Policy and ESRM Procedures manual with the afore-mentioned SBP manual. From end of November 2023, the Bank has been using SBP’s provided ESRM templates and complying with it (Regulatory Implementation dateline is November 2025). Our Environmental Risk & Green Banking Department (also known as Green Banking Office) is providing ESRM Advisory to all internal customers on transactional levels so that the staff do not face any difficulty in implementing the revised ESRM framework. The Bank is assigning E&S Risk Rating as ‘High’, ‘Medium’, and ‘Low’ to its borrowers based on its E&S due diligence which facilitates the Management in its decision making.

# Strategy for creating value from opportunity:

- Digital Cheque Clearing (High, High)
- After combating the teller based cash deposit transactions through Digital CDMs, the next challenge is to fight cheque clearing system which is plagued with time inefficiencies and susceptibility to human errors, particularly in subjective tasks such as signature matching.

An in-house indigenously developed 24/7 Cheque Deposit Kiosks is in process to be launched to give customers the convenience to clear their cheques instantly anytime, by using the power of machines to perform MICR & UV Matching and software to perform signature verification, OCR matching using machine learning, biometrics and special secure keys incorporated into the cheques. This strategic move is anticipated to yield convenience for customers, operational efficiencies and reduce costs, while concurrently mitigating fraud risks. The forecast is that this will take the bank to 95% digital to branch counter ratio of transactions, akin to global standards.

# Liquidity Management and Contingency Plan

The Bank manages and controls liquidity risk through a detailed risk management framework, which is approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank’s Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is primarily responsible for the formulation and oversight of its liquidity management strategy. Under the framework, the Bank closely watches the liquidity position (for all jurisdictions and at a consolidated level) through the monitoring of early warning indicators and stress testing, which ensures efficient and timely decision-making.

The Bank’s overall funding strategy is based on the principles of diversity and stability, and includes its equity and deposits. It has in place a set of liquidity ratios such as Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), currencies, and at a consolidated level along with maturity gaps, which are monitored on a regular basis for effective management of liquidity. Moreover, it is fully compliant with Basel III LCR and NSFR requirements, which shows its ability to meet short-term funding needs, and availability of stable funding against its asset portfolio.

A Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) is also in place to address liquidity issues in stress scenarios for each operation. The plan covers trigger (systemic and bank specific) action plans along with roles and responsibilities in the event of a liquidity crisis. Treasury prepares CFPs for all operations on an annual basis to identify stress scenarios and funding plans for such situations, along with early warning indicators. These plans are reviewed by the Risk Management Division, and are approved by the ALCO annually.

The liquidity profile of the Bank is adequate to cater to unforeseen liquidity crises, and any operational losses occurring in the normal course of business. For 2024, the Bank’s Basel III liquidity ratios, LCR and NSFR, stand at 191% and 126% respectively, well above the regulatory requirement of 100%, also disclosed in note 47 of unconsolidated financial statements. Its strong capital base is evident from our ability to withstand any liquidity challenge.

The Bank has adequate plans to discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, including long-term debts.

# Foreign Currency Sensitivity Analysis

The year 2024 marked a period of relative stability for the USDPKR, with the PKR appreciating by nearly 1% against the US dollar. This stabilization was supported by the disbursement of the USD 7 billion IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in September, which not only bolstered foreign reserves but also paved the way for additional financing from multilateral and bilateral sources. These developments strengthened market confidence and helped ease pressures on the external account.

Additionally, relatively slow GDP growth during the year played a key role in keeping the current account deficit in check, as subdued economic activity curbed import demand. Official foreign exchange reserves ended the year at USD 11.7 billion, a significant improvement from previous lows. This recovery in reserves reflected the combined impact of IMF inflows, external financing, and improved trade dynamics, providing the much-needed buffer to the economy and fostering confidence in its external stability.

# Responsible Disposal of Used Oil

Bank Alfalah has taken a significant step towards fostering sustainability by implementing a recycling initiative for the used oil from HVAC/Generators. Improper disposal of used oil, whether through direct dumping or unregulated reuse, can have detrimental effects on the environment, posing a threat to the ecological balance. To address this concern, the Bank has partnered with the Environmental Protection Agency approved expert to ensure that its used oil undergoes recycling in an environmentally responsible manner. Not only does this initiative contribute significantly to environmental preservation, but it also underscores its steadfast commitment to sustainable practices. 500 litres of used oil have been successfully recycled and reclaimed in 2024.

Moreover, this endeavour yields dual benefits: it not only safeguards our environment but also proves financially advantageous. We are able to realize cost savings with every litre of oil responsibly disposed of.

# • Responsibility levels of the key executives and Directors

# Policy on vesting and deferral of variable remuneration.

A certain portion of variable compensation of the CEO, key executives, MRTs/MRCs are subject to mandatory deferrals for a defined period, thus creating alignment between the employees’ and stakeholders’ interests, and reinforcing that compensation is appropriately linked to longer-term sustainable performance. Deferred remuneration, especially with risk adjustments, is a useful tool for improving risk-taking incentives because the amount ultimately received by employees can be made to depend on risk outcomes.

The deferral amount shall be withheld for a period of three years whereas remaining portion of the variable compensation shall be paid upfront to the CEO, key executives and MRTs/MRCs. The deferred remuneration shall vest proportionately over the deferral period following the year of the variable remuneration award. The deferred portion of the variable remuneration shall be paid to the CEO, key executives, and MRTs/MRCs proportionally through yearly instalments, during the deferred period, in case no malus triggers are applicable. In case of malus, and where accountability has been determined in accordance with the conduct and accountability framework of the Bank, the entire or certain portion of the deferred remuneration shall be withheld and not paid to the CEO, key executives and MRTs/MRCs on becoming due, and will be recorded back as income in the books of accounts of the Bank.

# Review Report on the Statement of Compliance contained in Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019

We have reviewed the enclosed Statement of Compliance with the Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019 (the Regulations) prepared by the Board of Directors of Bank Alfalah Limited (the Bank) for the year ended December 31, 2024 in accordance with the requirements of regulation 36 of the Regulations.

The responsibility for compliance with the Regulations is that of the Board of Directors of the Bank. Our responsibility is to review whether the Statement of Compliance reflects the status of the Bank’s compliance with the provisions of the Regulations and report if it does not and to highlight any non-compliance with the requirements of the Regulations. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of the Bank’s personnel and review of various documents prepared by the Bank to comply with the Regulations.

As a part of our audit of the financial statements we are required to obtain an understanding of the accounting and internal control systems sufficient to plan the audit and develop an effective audit approach. We are not required to consider whether the Board of Directors’ statement on internal control covers all risks and controls or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of such internal controls, the Bank’s corporate governance procedures and risks.

The Regulations require the Bank to place before the Audit Committee, and upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, place before the Board of Directors for their review and approval, its related party transactions. We are only required and have ensured compliance of this requirement to the extent of the approval of the related party transactions by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the Statement of Compliance does not appropriately reflect the Bank's compliance, in all material respects, with the requirements contained in the Regulations as applicable to the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2024.

# Statement of Internal Controls

This Statement of Internal Controls is based upon an ongoing process designed to identify the significant risks in achieving the bank’s policies, aims and objectives, and to evaluate nature and extent of those risks, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. This process remained in place throughout the year 2024.

The Board of Directors (Board) considers a sound control framework as the key to sustainable growth and value creation. The Board is ultimately responsible for the internal controls system of the Bank. Further, the Board has defined role of the Board’s Audit Committee (BAC) and Senior Management to establish and maintain an adequate and effective system of Internal Controls. Every endeavor is made to implement sound control procedures and to maintain a robust control environment.

The Bank, under its Compliance & Business Solution Group, has a dedicated Internal Controls Division (ICD) which through its regular onsite visits and offsite thematic reviews facilitates the management in timely identification and resolution of key control issues / compliance risk exposures which can affect the Bank adversely. The ICD, through its reviews, helps management to ensure that the Bank’s operations are carried out as per defined procedures: transactions are recorded in a timely manner; financial and management reporting is accurate, reliable and complete; and the Bank is compliant with the applicable laws, regulations and policies.

Besides ICD, other units of Compliance & Business Solution Group, vis-a-vis Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Department and Compliance Risk Management Unit are also integral parts of the Bank’s control framework, helping the Bank improve controls. This aspect is further evaluated and monitored through various organizational functions, such as Risk Management, Compliance & Internal Controls etc.

The Bank has an online Internal Controls Dashboard (ICD Dashboard) for centralized monitoring of certain critical controls. It serves as a tool to enhance the entity wide coverage of control risk exposure through timely identification of operational and regulatory risks, including control breaches at the branches and other functions. It assists in instant closure/rectification of issues preventing the Bank from financial and reputational losses. It helps in analyzing major control gaps, devising corrective action plan and catering to the training needs of the staff.

Furthermore, observations and weaknesses regarding control health pointed out by the Bank’s external and internal auditors are also addressed promptly and necessary steps are taken by the management to eradicate such weaknesses. ICD dashboard has transformed the whole spectrum of controls and compliance monitoring from the sample based periodic reviews of selected entities to continuous monitoring of key risk areas with coverage of entire population.

# Reviews of AML / CFT and Other Critical Regulatory Areas

The management believes that the Bank’s existing system of Internal Controls is considered reasonable in design and is functioning effectively and constantly monitored. There is a continuous improvement in the Bank’s Control Environment including technological solutions. Based upon the work performed, the management keeps on identifying areas for process improvements as well as implement additional controls required for strengthening existing controls. The management takes all necessary steps to ensure that the timelines and priorities assigned to the same are adhered to.

During the year 2024, ICD Dashboard coverage was extended to various critical business & operation functions alerts for timely monitoring and mitigation of risk exposure to safeguard the Bank from any financial or reputational losses. Besides this, significant issues were escalated to senior management through onsite ICD reviews to improve the operational health of branches/units.

The Bank shall continue in its endeavor to further enhance its internal control design and assessment process in accordance with the industry best practices. The Bank follows SBP guidelines on Internal Controls including guidelines pertaining to Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR). The Bank’s ICFR exercise is conducted annually with an objective to review the processes and operating effectiveness of controls over key areas of the Bank’s operations, which affect financial reporting.

ICFR unit, under Finance Division, is responsible for implementation of the stage-wise ICFR Framework and to perform tests of controls for the management functions. In line with SBP exemption from the requirement of external auditors’ Long Form Report (LFR), Audit and Inspection Group of the Bank reviewed the bank’s ICFR function for the year 2023 and submitted an Assessment Report to the Board Audit Committee (BAC). The ICFR review for 2024 is in progress and an Assessment Report will be submitted to BAC during first quarter of 2025 in line with regulatory requirements.

The Bank’s system of Internal Controls is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve its business strategies and objectives. It can, therefore, only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement and losses.

In accordance with Board’s vision along with SBP and SECP guidelines, the management has implemented a comprehensive governance and control framework to ensure efficiency and effectiveness of operations, compliance with legal requirements and reliability of financial reporting. Adequate systems, processes and controls have been put in place to identify and mitigate the risk of failure to achieve the overall objectives of the Bank.

For and behalf of the Board,

Atif Aslam Bajwa

# Quantitative Projections

The bank was able to deliver highest ever profit in 2024, and expects the profitability to normalize with interest rate reduction in a stable economic environment.

The interest rate declined from its peak of 22% in Jun’24 to 13% in Dec’24, followed by another 100-bps cut in Jan’25. The policy rate is expected to remain largely unchanged. Consequently, the net interest income of the bank is expected to remain at same level as last year as benefit from volumetric growth will be offset by lower spreads. Similarly, growth in fee / commission and FX income is also expected to remain flat despite higher number of transactions and throughput, and a lack of currency volatility. This is mainly due to change in BISP mandate and revision in SBP’s remittance rebate scheme. The interest rate decline and strong PSX rally during 2024 enabled the Bank to realize higher capital gains from Money Market and Capital Market respectively. Such opportunities may be limited in 2025, thereby restricting overall revenue growth.

The Bank is accelerating lending growth with a greater focus on consumer, SME, and Agri lending. Its strategic expansion includes scaling operations in the UAE, enhancing advisory capabilities, promoting green finance, supporting customer growth in Mergers & Acquisitions, and cross-border expansion. The Bank’s commitment to digital transformation is central to its strategy. The Bank is advancing AI-driven decision-making, cheque digitization, and robotic process automation to enhance efficiency. Key initiatives include expanding remote banking solutions for Gen-Z customers and converting cash payments to digital.

The bank plans to continue investment in adding touch-points i.e. new branches and further deployment of ATMs, CDMs and CCDMs despite import and payment related issues. New initiatives planned for 2025 will result in initial cost outlays, the benefits of which are expected to materialise in later periods. The cost increase combined with limited growth in revenue will adversely impact bank’s Cost to income ratio, which is expected to normalise in the long run as revenues normalise.

The bank will continue its deposits growth journey with strong focus on low cost and sticky core current deposits. We expect to deliver growth of 10%-15% from last year. Moreover, the bank plans to optimize its cost of deposits in both conventional and Islamic segments, while also focusing on improving its average deposits and expanding its current account base. Similarly, the bank expects to improve its spreads on lending book which were impacted due to ‘price war’. With stability in the system and lower interest rates, the bank remains committed to resilience, growth, and innovation. As the industry evolves, the Bank will continue to adapt to emerging economic and regulatory shifts, ensuring it is well-positioned to navigate future challenges and opportunities. The Bank’s focus remains on enhancing customer experiences, embracing technological advancements, and aligning with sustainability principles, all while maintaining financial strength and operational efficiency.

# Uncertainties that Could Affect the Bank’s Resource, Revenues and Operations

All forward looking statements are by nature, subject to risks and uncertainties, and some of these are beyond our control. The impacts could vary from short term to medium and long term. Factors that may potentially affect the Bank’s resources, revenues and operations are as follows:

- Decisions on discount rate/monetary policy;
- Geo-political risks and uncertainties across the geography that the Bank operate in;
- Law and order situation;
- Cyber Security;
- Local government rules and regulations;
- Trade policies of trade partner countries;
- Changing priorities at the regulators’ end;
- Inflation, fuel and general commodity prices;
- Corporate taxation measures; and
- Increased competition from emerging FinTechs and digital banks.

The Bank’s strong financial position, processes and controls make it resilient to these changes, many of which were tested in 2024. The results of these stress tests were presented to the management committees and the board committees for information and forward guidance.

# Assumptions

# Economic Position

Successful negotiation of the USD 7 billion IMF EFF program paved the way for economic stability as it helped the country improve its financial repute. Support from friendly countries, bilateral and multilateral lenders, along with positive current account balances aided in much needed foreign exchange reserve build-up despite debt servicing payments during the year. Furthermore, SBP also purchased USD 9 billion from the interbank market during the last six months of CY2024 to improve its foreign exchange reserves. Going forward, the current account stability is likely to persist as the Eid flows will likely keep the remittances numbers intact while the government’s disciplined import policy is also likely to continue. Soft international oil prices owing to depressed global demand will also help to keep the import bill in check.

# Policy Rate

State Bank of Pakistan decreased policy rate by 900 bps from 22% to 13% in response to substantial decline in inflationary pressures. The Bank expects policy rate to be in the range of 11-12% in 2025.

# Inflation

The YoY CPI inflation for December 2024 was reported at 4.1% compared to 29.7% in December 2023. The drop in inflation during CY2024 was quicker than previously anticipated by the market. Going forward, SBP is hopeful for the inflation to stabilise between target range of 5-7% going forward.

# Overall Outlook

On the back of stringent monetary and fiscal measures implemented by the government during 2023, Pakistan’s economy underwent a stabilization phase during 2024. The policy rate was slashed by 9% mainly during the second half of CY2024 amidst aggressive decline in inflation. On the other hand, external balances showed massive improvement with consecutive current account surpluses during July to November 2024.

# Significant External Factors and the Bank’s Response

Bank Alfalah’s external environment, including political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal factors have an impact on business performance, strategic objectives and availability, quality, and affordability of capital.

## Chunk 591


# Macroeconomic Environment

The calendar year 2024 was a period of stabilization for Pakistan’s economy following the challenges faced in 2023. Inflation, which had surged and remained elevated throughout 2023, began to decline in 2024. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), which had peaked at 38% in 2023, fell drastically to 4.1% by December 2024. This reduction in inflation facilitated a decline in the policy rate, which dropped from 22% in June to 13% by December 2024, marking a cumulative reduction of 9% over five consecutive Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meetings.

The reduction in interest rates also benefited the equity market, helping the KSE-100 Index surpass the 100,000-point mark which closed around 115,000 points at the end of the year. On the fiscal front, the government succeeded in reducing the fiscal deficit to 6.8% of GDP in FY2024, down from 7.8% in FY2023. The primary balance recorded a surplus of 0.9% of GDP during FY2024, in contrast to a deficit of 1.0% of GDP in FY2023.

Government revenues grew by 38% during FY2024, driven by a significant increase in both tax and non-tax collections. Building on the momentum from FY2024, revenue growth, coupled with disciplined expenditure management, enabled the government to post a fiscal surplus of 0.4% of GDP and a substantial primary surplus of 3% of GDP during July-November FY2025.

With inflation continuing its downward trajectory, market expectations are for further rate cuts in the future. As the monetary easing cycle persists, business activity is likely to improve, evidenced by a recent uptick in private credit off-take. However, the resultant increase in domestic demand could lead to a rise in import demand, placing pressure on exchange rate stability. To mitigate these risks, the government will need to deploy appropriate fiscal tools to manage demand growth within sustainable limits, thereby preventing an overheating of the economy and minimizing potential adverse effects on external balances.

Additionally, the geopolitical environment and the global commodity prices, specifically oil, will need to be closely monitored as they pose major upside risks to the country’s economic stability.

# Bank’s Response

Changes in the macro-environment, ranging from inflation and/or currency pressures, affect the performance of the Bank, which is reflected in its results and in the stock price of the Bank. The Bank keeps a track of key metrics that might affect profitability and as per its best judgement, pre-empts developments and aligns its internal strategy accordingly. The Bank thus takes measures such as balance sheet re-alignment and altering of portfolio to protect its Net Interest Income (NII) in a lower interest rate environment. Consequently, the Bank has also accumulated significant unrealized gains in its fixed income portfolio, as yields experienced substantial declines following the policy rate cuts.

# Policy Changes

Any policy changes that directly impact the banking landscape, and cost and/or revenue drivers are likely to exert the influence on the Bank’s performance. A change in the policy rate, which directly impacts yields on all earning assets and liabilities, would have considerable impact. Similarly, any regulatory changes such as a change in the minimum rate payable on deposits and schemes brought in by the SBP can have a significant impact on the cost of funds and profitability.

In response to a significant easing of inflationary pressures and with the aim of fostering economic growth as the economy emerges from the consolidation phase, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) implemented a cumulative reduction of 900 basis points in interest rates from 22% to 13% as of December 2024. This was achieved through five consecutive rate cuts between June and December.

# Bank’s Response

Building on its earlier two-phase flood recovery plan, Bank Alfalah significantly expanded its CSR efforts in 2024. A key highlight was the establishment of a healthcare facility in Thatta, funded with PKR 25 million, to provide long-term support for flood-affected communities. The bank also collaborated with Deaf Reach to set up three satellite schools for deaf children in Sindh and Balochistan, committing PKR 24 million to empower underserved youth through education and vocational training.

Continuing its focus on healthcare, the Bank partnered with Cancer Foundation Hospital and Roche Pakistan during its Pinktober campaign, contributing PKR 10.75 million to provide life-saving treatment for breast cancer patients and promote early detection awareness across major cities.

To mitigate inflation’s impact on staff, entry-level salaries were raised to PKR 40,000, and retirement benefits were extended to age 65, reinforcing the bank’s commitment to employee welfare.

# Legal and Regulatory Environment

Major challenges faced by the banking sector are trade-based money laundering and terrorism financing. Legal environment also encompasses the restrictions and constraints set by FATF, IMF and other international bodies. Additionally, with the growing use of digital channels, there is an even greater threat to financial security.

On a legal and regulatory front, there are AML / KYC issues and several other regulations which the Bank is required to comply with. Bank Alfalah worked towards enhancing customer experience and increasing business activity, while abiding by the standards and guidelines set by FATF, the SBP and other regulatory bodies on AML/CFT/CPF, Trade AML, information security threats including identity theft etc. The Bank also complies with the UNSC Targeted Financial Sanctions on Designated Persons and Proscribed Persons. This is done by making the best use of Regulatory Technology Tools and skilled human resources.

# Political Environment

A stable political environment is crucial for economic growth as it enables organizations to operate effectively within a conducive business climate. However, in 2024, Pakistan experienced significant political instability, marked by nationwide protests and disruptions. These events led to frequent interruptions in telecommunication networks, particularly during major demonstrations.

Additionally, cross-border terrorism and strained relations with neighbouring countries further exacerbated the political instability, diminishing investor confidence in Pakistan's business environment.

Contrary to expectations, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) demonstrated resilience during this period. In November 2024, the KSE-100 index reached record highs, crossing the 94,000 mark on November 11 and surpassing 99,000 points on November 22. Therefore, while political instability and security challenges persisted, the PSX's performance indicated a complex economic landscape, with investor confidence showing resilience despite the prevailing uncertainties.

# Environmental Scenario

Globally, organizations and nations are aligning with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), integrating objectives like Goal 5: Gender Equality and Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure into their strategies to foster a sustainable future.

Pakistan's geographic location and reliance on fossil fuels for energy production and heating make it particularly vulnerable to climate change. The country faces significant environmental challenges, including poor air quality in major cities like Lahore and Karachi, water pollution, and deforestation. Contributors to these issues include untreated industrial sewage and unsustainable logging and land conversion practices.

The Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) 2024 ranks Pakistan 31st, with high ratings in greenhouse gas emissions and energy use, but low in climate policy and very low in renewable energy. This underscores the need for urgent action to create a sustainable environment for future generations.

The banking industry plays a crucial role in mitigating environmental risks by adopting and promoting sustainable practices within its operations and considering environmental factors in stakeholder relationships and investment decisions.

# Bank’s Response

In line with the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) Green Banking Guidelines (GBGs) issued in 2017, the Bank has implemented various initiatives to promote sustainability. This includes regular reporting on environmental and social risk management, green business practices, and efforts to reduce its own environmental impact. Additionally, the Bank is actively working to reduce lending to unsustainable businesses and has integrated environmental responsibility into its policies by considering environmental and social impacts in its credit approval process.

To further strengthen these efforts, SBP launched the Fair Treatment of Customers (FTC) remained central, emphasizing transparency and customer-first approaches.

# Competitive Landscape and Market Positioning

# Competitive Landscape

Threat of New Competition and Substitute Products or Services

There are significant barriers to the entry for new competition due to the need for considerable capital to set up a bank, compliance with strict regulations of the banking sector, and the time required to establish a strong brand identity, and, in turn, loyalty of customers. However, the emergence of Fintech entities and Digital Banks with their innovative digital solutions and focus on transactional services has added greater depth to the domestic financial landscape and the customers’ banking experience.

# Bargaining Power of Customers

The bargaining power mainly rests with the Bank’s deposit holders, and since they are the Bank’s primary source of capital, their bargaining power ranges from medium to high. This is because of low differentiation in the industry, making it easier for depositors to switch to other banks in pursuit of incentives such as greater saving rates and better service offerings. However, the bargaining power of High-Net-Worth individuals, corporate clients and other large groups has greater bearing due to their high price sensitivity arising from strong competition amongst banks.

# Bank’s Response:

Customers incur negligible costs, while switching to other banks partly or completely, the Bank’s bottom line is minimally affected due to such shifts. To mitigate possible concerns arising from the customers’ bargaining power, the following strategies are exercised:

# Financial Measures

The Bank incorporates key financial measures when formulating future projections. Targets are set against the following broad financial measures:

- Deposits: The Bank continuously reviews the quality of its deposit mix with particular emphasis on low cost CASA. Apart from the deposit mix, the pricing of deposit and the associated spread are critical factors in the origination process.
- Advances: Sustainable measured growth in advances, is the key driver of profitability, as advances remains one of the prime source of earnings for the Bank. The Bank places great emphasis on credit quality and segmental diversification of its credit portfolio. Effective management of advances is critical, as it directly impacts credit risk. Therefore, a robust risk assessment mechanism is essential to maintain quality of the credit portfolio.
- Investments: The Bank manages its portfolio of short and long-term bonds based on interest rate forecasts to optimize returns. It maintains an ideal balance according to rate expectations, aiming to generate high profits and ensure sustainable earnings.

# Key Financial Metrics

- Cost to Income Ratio: The Bank continues to prioritise cost efficiency. Centralisation of expenses, digitalisation, integration and elimination of redundancies continue to play a pivotal role in driving effective cost control.
- Returns on Earning Assets (ROEA): The ROEA depicts the ability of Bank’s earning assets to generate income. This metric is influenced by effective management strategy and the Bank’s success in capturing a significant market share. A strong ROEA demonstrates Bank's efficient deployment of assets in driving revenue.
- Net Spread: Net spread is a key financial measure in evaluating the core profitability of the Bank. It represents the difference between mark-up earned on interest bearing assets (uses) and mark-up paid on interest bearing liabilities (sources). Effective management of both the sources and uses of funds is essential for optimising the net spread and ensuring sustainable profitability.
- Return on Equity: Return on equity remains a key measure to assess returns for the Bank's shareholders.

# Non-Financial Measures

Despite these challenges, the bank successfully met its operating profit target.

Non-financial measures hold equal importance in shaping the future direction of the organisation. Performance assessed against these measures demonstrates that the Bank not only maintains sound and transparent business operations but also fulfills its role as a responsible corporate citizen. While these standards are qualitative in nature, their contribution to the business has proven to be substantial in recent years. Key non-financial measures include:

- Adherence to regulatory frameworks
- Corporate image and reputation
- Stakeholders’ engagement
- Brand preference
- Relationship with customers and business partners
- Employee satisfaction and well-being
- Social responsibility
- Environmental sustainability
- SBP inspection rating and robust internal control

# Performance versus Budget

The Bank successfully achieved its key business volume targets, with mid-year adjustments to deposits and advances targets in response to ADR tax.

- Net Interest Income (NII) remained a challenge, as reduction in interest rates exceeded initial assumptions. Spreads remained compressed from start of the year as market yields declined earlier in anticipation of rate cuts, while the cost of deposits and borrowings, being pegged to the policy rate, remained elevated. Additionally, pricing distortions in advances impacted yields in the last quarter.

- However, strong contributions from capital gains, fee income, and exchange income resulted in higher than budget Non-Funded Income (NFI).

- Costs remained within budget, even as the bank continued to expand its network and invest in new initiatives.

# Operating Expenses

The overall growth in administrative costs has primarily been driven by expenses related to the expansion of additional branches as part of the Bank’s growth strategy, compensation costs (including staff loans notional costs, new hiring and various employee-focused remuneration initiatives) and marketing expenses. Rising rentals, utility costs, substantial IT investments for upgrading the core banking system and digital banking platform, as well as inflation and the depreciation of the currency have also contributed to the increase.

# DuPont Analysis

| |2024|2023|2022|2021|2020|2019|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Net Operating Margin Proﬁt after taxation / Gross Income %|6.95%|8.27%|7.72%|12.19%|9.94%|12.34%|
|Asset Turnover Gross Income / Average Assets %|16.54%|16.41%|13.73%|7.55%|8.79%|10.21%|
|Equity Multiplier Average Assets / Average Equity Times|21.61|23.33|18.15|16.63|13.23|12.43|
|Return on Equity Proﬁt after taxation / Average Equity %|24.83%|31.67%|19.23%|15.30%|11.55%|15.65%|

The DuPont model, which analyses return on equity, breaks down performance into three key components: (a) operating efﬁciency, also known as the ﬁnancial performance ratio, measured by net operating margin; (b) asset utilization efﬁciency, which indicates how effectively assets are used, measured by total asset turnover; and (c) ﬁnancial leverage, which shows the extent to which the bank depends on debt, measured by the equity multiplies.

Net operating margin decreased from 12.34% in 2019 to 6.95% in 2024 impacted by higher tax, spreads compression due to high correlation to interest rates, inﬂationary pressure and expansionary initiatives which will give payback in future. On the other side, the Bank's efﬁciency has generally improved, as reﬂected in the increase in asset turnover ratio from 10.21% to 16.54%, demonstrating efﬁcient mobilization of its earning assets to drive total income which includes, capital gains, FX income and spreads. Additionally, the equity multiplier rose from 12.43 to 21.61, highlighting the effective use of ﬁnancial leverage to enhance returns. Overall, the company’s strategic focus on improving operational efﬁciency and leveraging assets has resulted in a strong and consistent increase in Return on Equity (ROE). Resultantly, from 2019 to 2024, the ROE of the Bank rose from 15.65% to 24.83%.

Note: Had there been no change in tax rate, the EVA would have been amounted to Rs. 20.592 billion in year 2024.

Economic value added (EVA) is the economic profit by the Bank in a given period. It measures the Bank’s financial performance based on the residual wealth calculated by deducting its cost of capital from its operating profit, adjusted for taxes. A positive EVA reflects that the bank is increasing its value to its shareholders, whereas a negative EVA indicates that it is diminishing its value to its shareholders.

# Factors affecting the Share Price of the Bank

# Discount rate / Monetary Policy

Based on different assessment parameters, the State Bank of Pakistan can change the monetary policy rate. Any volatility in the interest rates might impact revenue and profitability of the Bank.

# Minimum Rate of Return on Deposits/ Regulatory risk

Any upward revision in the minimum deposit rate will result in compression in net interest margins earned due to increased cost of deposits. Such revision can negatively impact the earning and correspondingly the share price of the scrip.

## Chunk 709


# Inflation

Inflation is considered as a key determinant for policy rate change. Any uptick in the inflation statistics will have a corresponding impact on the monetary policy rate. With higher discount rates, the banks will be able to invest in high yielding investments, thus resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn will have a positive impact on the share price. On the other hand, admin cost increase due to inflation will impact profitability.

# Exchange fluctuations

The Bank is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates owing to the imports and exports. The Bank has to bear currency exchange rate fluctuation risk. Hence, the currency fluctuation also affects the Banking business.

# Political Stability & Law and order situation

Political stability reduces the uncertainty and urges investors to put their funds in different investment avenue. Politically stable government is expected to adopt policies to facilitate the investors.

# Act of God

Act of God outside the control of the Bank such as natural disasters, floods and pandemics might negatively disrupt the operations of the Bank and ultimately might affect share price of the Bank.

# Effect of Seasonality on the Bank’s Performance

The agriculture sector in Pakistan is highly seasonal, significantly influencing the borrowing patterns of farmers, traders, SMEs, and mill operators. The two main cropping seasons, Kharif and Rabi, dictate the financial needs and borrowing trends throughout the year.

During the Kharif season (April to October), farmers typically require substantial financing for purchasing seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and other inputs. This leads to a spike in borrowing from banks and financial institutions in the early months of the season (April to June). As the crops grow, the need for additional funds for irrigation and maintenance may also arise. The Rabi (October to April) season sees an increase in borrowing during the sowing period (October to December). Farmers need funds for seeds, fertilizers, and other inputs. The demand for credit may also rise during the mid-season for irrigation and crop protection.

# Seasonal demand in Trading / Distribution (SMEs):

Traders and SMEs involved in the agriculture supply chain experience seasonal demand fluctuations. For instance, during the harvest season, there is an increased need for storage, transportation, and distribution, leading to higher borrowing for working capital and Short-term loans (AVC – Alfalah Supply Chain).

# Key product / segment impacted:

# Key Audit Matter

|S.No.|Key Audit Matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|Credit loss allowance against advances: (Refer notes 4.3 and 9 to the unconsolidated financial statements)|The Bank records credit loss allowance against advances in Pakistan operations in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan and as per the instructions of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Under IFRS 9, the Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the Expected Credit Losses ('ECL') associated with the advances. A lifetime ECL is recorded on advances in which there have been a Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) from the date of initial recognition and on advances which are credit impaired as on the reporting date. A 12 months ECL is recorded for advances which do not meet the criteria for SICR or "credit impaired" as at the reporting date. To assess whether there is a significant increase in the credit risk, the Bank compares the risk of a default occurring on the advances as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. Both lifetime and 12 months ECL are calculated at facility level. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account and is decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. The Bank records charge for Stage 3 based on the higher of provision under the Prudential Regulations or ECL under IFRS 9, as per the instructions of the SBP. This assessment is conducted at the facility level for corporate, commercial, and SME loan portfolios, and at a segment level for the retail portfolio. If one facility of a counterparty becomes 90+ days past due (DPD) or is otherwise defined as impaired under the Prudential Regulations, all other facilities of that counterparty are classified as Stage 3. The measurement of ECL involves evaluating a range of possible outcomes, considering the time value of money, and incorporating reasonable and supportable information available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions. The net provision made/reversed during the year is charged to the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account and accumulated provision is netted-off against advances. Provisions pertaining to overseas advances are made in accordance with the requirements of the regulatory authorities of the respective countries. The Bank has recognised a net credit loss allowance/provision against advances amounting to Rs. 1,857.895 million in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account in the current year. As at December 31, 2024, the Bank holds a credit loss allowance/provision of Rs. 46,881.822 million against advances.|

|1|The determination of credit loss allowance / provision against advances based on the above criteria remains a significant area of judgment and estimation. Because of the significance of the impact of these judgments / estimations and the materiality of advances relative to the overall unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank, we considered this area as a key audit matter.|We issued instructions to auditors of those overseas branches which were selected for audit, highlighting ‘Credit loss allowance against advances’ as a significant risk. The auditors of those branches performed audit procedures to check compliance with regulatory requirements and reported the results thereof to us. We, as auditors of the Bank, evaluated the work performed by the component auditors and the results thereof.|

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the unconsolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.

•  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

•  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.

•  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the unconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the unconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

2. the unconsolidated statement of financial position, the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account, the unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated statement of changes in equity and unconsolidated cash flow statement together with the notes thereon have been drawn up in conformity with the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and are in agreement with the books of account and returns;
3. investments made, expenditure incurred and guarantees extended during the year were in accordance with the objects and powers of the Bank and the transactions of the Bank which have come to our notice have been within the powers of the Bank;
4. Zakat deductible at source under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance, 1980 (XVIII of 1980), was deducted by the Bank and deposited in the Central Zakat Fund established under section 7 of that Ordinance.
2. We confirm that for the purpose of our audit we have covered more than sixty percent of the total loans and advances of the Bank.

The SBP through BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2015 dated February 25, 2015 had deferred the applicability of Islamic Financial Accounting Standard-3 for Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits (IFAS-3) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) and notified by the SECP, vide their SRO No. 571 of 2013 dated June 12, 2013 for Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services (IIFS). Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements.

The SBP has issued BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 dated January 22, 2025 in which certain relaxations / clarifications have been provided upon adoption of IFRS 9 which are disclosed in note 4.1 to the unconsolidated financial statements. As allowed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022, IFRS 9 has not been adopted for overseas branches where it is not applicable as per their local regulations for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 13 dated July 01, 2024, issued the revised forms for the preparation of the annual financial statements of the Banks / DFIs which are applicable for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 as per BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023. The implementation of the revised forms has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of these unconsolidated financial statements. The significant change is relating to right of use assets and corresponding lease liability which are now presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position. Previously, these were presented under property and equipment (earlier titled as fixed assets) and other liabilities respectively. There is no impact of this change on the unconsolidated financial statements in terms of recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities.

The Bank has adopted the above changes in the presentation and made additional disclosures to the extent applicable to its operations and corresponding figures have been rearranged / reclassified to correspond to the current period presentation, as presented in note 53.1.

# 2.2.1

These unconsolidated financial statements represent separate financial statements of Bank Alfalah Limited in which investments in subsidiaries and associates are accounted for as stated in note 4.6.

# 2.2.2

Key financial figures of Islamic Banking branches are disclosed in Annexure II to these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 2.2.3

The management of the Bank believes that there is no significant doubt on the ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, these unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2025 but are considered not to be relevant or will not have any material effect on the Bank's financial statements except for:

- the new standard - IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (IFRS 18) (published in April 2024) with applicability date of January 01, 2027 by IASB. IFRS 18 is yet to be adopted in Pakistan. IFRS 18 when adopted and applicable shall impact the presentation of 'Statement of Profit and Loss Account' with certain additional disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements.
- amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' which clarify the date of recognition and derecognition of a financial asset or financial liability including settlement of liabilities through banking instruments and channels including electronic transfers. The amendment when applied may impact the timing of recognition and derecognition of financial liabilities.
- amendment to IAS 21 Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange which will require Banks to apply a consistent approach in assessing whether a currency can be exchanged into another currency and, when it cannot, in determining the exchange rate to use and the disclosures to provide.

The management is in the process of assessing the impact of these amendments on the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank.

Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses as well as in the disclosure of contingent liabilities. It also requires management to exercise judgment in application of its accounting policies. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and in future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Material accounting estimates and areas where judgments were made by the management in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

1. classification and credit loss allowance / provisioning against investments (notes 4.6 and 8);
2. classification and credit loss allowance / provisioning against loans and advances (notes 4.7 and 9);
3. income taxes (notes 4.14 and 35);
4. accounting for defined benefit plan and compensated absences (notes 4.11, 39 and 41);
5. depreciation and revaluation of property and equipment and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claim (notes 4.8.2, 4.8.5, 10 and 13.1.1);
6. amortisation of intangibles assets (notes 4.8.3 and 12);
7. impairment of non-financial assets (notes 4.15 and 8.4.4);
8. employee stock option scheme (notes 4.11(d) and 42);
9. fair value measurement of financial instruments (note 43);
10. credit loss allowance / provision against other assets and other provisions (notes 4.17 and 13.4);
11. credit loss allowance / provision against off balance sheet obligations and contingent liabilities (notes 4.16, 4.18, 20.1, and 23); and
12. lease liability including determination of the lease term for lease contracts with renewal and termination options and right-of-use assets (the Bank as a lessee) (notes 4.8.4.1, 11 and 17).

# 4.1 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

As per the SBP BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9 is applicable on banks with effect from January 01, 2024. IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of accounting for financial liabilities. To determine appropriate classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments, to be assessed based on combination of the entity's business model for managing the assets and the instruments' contractual cash flows characteristics. The adoption of IFRS 9 has also fundamentally changed the impairment method of financial assets with a forward-looking Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach.

The SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 dated January 22, 2025 (Letters) has made certain amendments and clarified the timelines of some of the SBP's IFRS 9 Application Instructions to address the matters raised by the banks to ensure compliance by the timelines. The Letters have provided clarifications / relaxations on measurement of unquoted equity securities, modification accounting, maintenance of general provisions over and above ECL, accounting methodology for Islamic Banking Institutions and treatment of charity. Accordingly, the Bank has adopted the treatment as instructed in the aforementioned Letters in these unconsolidated financial statements. In addition, the SBP in a separate instruction SBPHOK-BPRD-RPD-BAF-834424 dated January 22, 2025 has allowed extension for application of Effective Interest Rate up to December 31, 2025.

The SBP has directed the Banks through its BPRD Circular Letter No.1 dated January 22, 2025 to continue the existing revenue recognition methodology for Islamic Operations, including the requirements of IFAS 1 and IFAS 2 until further instructions. Had IFRS 9 been adopted in its entirety for revenue recognition from Islamic operations, the profit after tax of the Bank would have been lower by Rs. 167.847 million. Further, unappropriated profit of the Bank as at December 31, 2024 would have been higher by Rs. 578.741 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 827.739 million).

On application of IFRS 9, certain accounting policies have been revised to comply with the requirements of IFRS 9. The revised accounting policies have been disclosed in their respective policy notes in these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 4.1.1 Application to the Bank's financial assets

Debt based financial assets held by the Bank include: advances, lending to financial institutions, investment in Federal Government securities, corporate bonds and other private sukuks, cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks, and other financial assets.

a) These are measured at amortised cost if these assets meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as fair value through profit and loss (FVPL):

- the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

The business model for these financial assets can still be held to collect (HTC) even when sales of these financial assets occur. However, if more than an infrequent number of sales of significant value are made, the Bank assesses whether and how the sales are consistent with the HTC objective.

b) Debt based financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) only if these meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as FVPL:

- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

c) Debt based financial assets if these are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. The application of IFRS 9 has also resulted in classifications and consequent remeasurements of certain investments in PIBs and Ijarah Sukuk held under available for sale portfolio as of December 31, 2023 to hold to collect based on the business model assessment. The following table reconciles their carrying amounts as reported on December 31, 2023 to the carrying amounts under IFRS 9 on transition to IFRS 9 on January 01, 2024:

|Investment type and category|Balances as of December 31, 2023|Remeasurements|Balances as of January 01, 2024 - before ECL| | | |

Equity based financial assets An equity instrument held by the Bank for trading purposes is classified as measured at FVPL. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. The Bank has decided to classify Rs. 767.222 million out of its available for sale equity investment (listed shares) portfolio as of December 31, 2023 as FVPL. IFRS 9 has eliminated impairment assessment requirements for investments in equity instruments. Accordingly, the Bank has reclassified impairment of Rs. 59.818 million on listed equity investments and Rs. 88.038 million for unlisted equity investment held as at December 31, 2023 to surplus / deficit on revaluation of investments through remeasurements.

The measurement category and carrying amounts of financial assets in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan before and after adoption of IFRS 9 as at January 01, 2024 are compared as follows:

|Financial assets|Measurement category|Carrying amount as at December 31, 2023|Measurement category|Carrying amount as at January 01, 2024|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cash and balances with treasury banks|Loans and receivables|202,692,402|Amortised cost|202,692,402|
|Balances with other banks|Loans and receivables|16,617,834|Amortised cost|16,617,834|
|Lending to financial institutions|Loans and receivables|119,554,109|Amortised cost|119,554,109|

# 4.2 Financial assets and liabilities

# 4.2.1 Classification

Financial assets

Under IFRS 9, existing categories of financial assets: Held for trading (HFT), Available for sale (AFS), Held to maturity (HTM) and loans and receivables have been replaced by:

- Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss account (FVPL)
- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- Financial assets at amortised cost

Financial liabilities

The accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus financial liabilities are being carried at amortised cost except for derivatives which are being measured at FVPL.

Financial assets and financial liabilities primarily includes following:

|Head|Description|
|---|---|
|Cash and balances with treasury banks|note 4.4|
|Balances with other banks|note 4.4|
|Lendings to financial institutions|note 4.5|

# 4.2.2 Business model assessment

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Bank's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether the management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model is evaluated and reported to the Bank's key management personnel;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sale are also important aspects of the assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress scenarios into account.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:

1. Hold to Collect (HTC) business model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash flows
2. Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S) business model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
3. Other business models: Resulting in classification of financial assets as FVPL

# 4.2.3 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest / profit (SPPI)

As a second step of its classification process, the Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether these assets meet the SPPI test. for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium / discount). The most significant elements of interest / profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as, but not limited to, the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest / profit rate is set. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at FVPL.

# 4.2.4 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Bank purchases or sells the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like advances, lending to financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the account or financial institutions. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased.

# a) Amortised cost (AC)

Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Interest income / profit / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss is recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for debt based financial assets in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of debt based financial assets, capital gain / loss is recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is transferred from surplus / deficit to unappropriated profit.

# c) Fair value through profit and loss (FVPL)

Financial assets under FVPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost is directly recorded in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Interest / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss is recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

# 4.2.5 Derecognition

# Financial assets

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expires. The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its unconsolidated statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

# Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

## Chunk 776


# 4.2.6 Modification

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of financing to its customers. The Bank assesses whether the modified terms result in the financial asset being significantly modified and therefore derecognised. When the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified and the renegotiation or modification does not result in the derecognition of that financial asset in accordance with IFRS 9, the Bank recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset and shall recognise a modification gain or loss in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. The gross carrying amount of the financial asset is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial original effective interest rate (or credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets). Any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

# 4.3 Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with all advances and other debt financial assets not held at FVPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Bank recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money; and
- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

# Definition of default

The concept of "impairment or "default" is critical to the implementation of IFRS 9 as it drives determination of risk parameters, i.e. PD, LGD and EAD.

As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level for corporate / commercial / SME loan portfolios and at segment / product basis for retail portfolio.

This implies that if one facility of a counterparty becomes 90+ DPD in repaying its contractual dues or as defined in PRs; all other facilities would deem to be classified as stage 3.

# 4.4 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash in hand, balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks in current and deposit accounts, national prize bonds, overdrawn nostro accounts and call lendings having original maturity of three months or less.

# 4.8.2 Property and equipment

Property and equipment are shown at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any, except land and buildings which are carried at revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Historical cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Depreciation is charged by applying the straight-line method using the rates specified in note 10.2 to these unconsolidated financial statements. The depreciation charge for the year is calculated after taking into account residual value, if any. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.

Depreciation on additions is charged from the date on which the assets are available for use and ceases on the date on which these are disposed off. Maintenance and normal repairs are charged to income as and when incurred. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or are recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that the net carrying amounts do not differ materially from their fair values.

A revaluation surplus is recorded in other comprehensive income as part of surplus on revaluation of property and equipment in equity. However, to the extent that it reverses a revaluation deficit of the same asset previously recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account, the increase is recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. A revaluation deficit is recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account, except to the extent that it offsets an existing surplus on the same asset recognised in the asset revaluation surplus. A transfer from the asset revaluation surplus to unappropriated profit is made for the difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset and depreciation based on the original cost. Additionally, accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.

An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are taken to the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account except that the related surplus / deficit on revaluation of property & equipment (net of deferred taxation) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

# 4.8.3 Intangible assets

Intangible assets having a finite useful life are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The useful lives and amortisation method are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate at each reporting date. Intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are stated at acquisition cost, less impairment loss, if any. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment, if any, as described under note 4.15.

# 4.8.4 Leases

# Lease liabilities

At the commencement date of the lease, the Bank recognises lease liability measured at the present value of the consideration (lease payments) to be made over the lease term and is adjusted for lease prepayments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, unless it is not readily determinable, in which case the lessee may use the incremental rate of borrowing. After the commencement date, the carrying amount of lease liability is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.

# Determination of the lease term for lease contracts with renewal and termination options (Bank as a lessee)

The Bank determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

The Bank has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Bank applies judgment in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination.

After the commencement date, the Bank reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control that affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate.

# Incremental borrowing rate (IBR)

The IBR is the rate of mark-up that the Bank would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The Bank estimates the IBR using observable inputs such as market interest rates.

# 4.8.4.2 Bank as a lessor

Leases in which the Bank does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income.

# 4.8.5 Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claim

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are stated at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation thereon. The valuation of properties acquired under this head is conducted as per the SBP's requirement, so as to ensure that their net carrying values do not materially differ from their fair values. Any surplus arising on revaluation of such properties is transferred to the surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets in other comprehensive income, while any deficit arising on revaluation is charged to the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account directly except to the extent that it offsets an existing surplus on the same asset recognised in the asset revaluation surplus. Depreciation on assets acquired in satisfaction of claims is charged to the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account on straight line method over the useful life of the assets. In addition, all direct costs, including legal fees and transfer costs linked with transferring the title of the property to the Bank is accounted as an expense in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Any shares acquired in satisfaction of claims are stated at revalued amount at each reporting date with the corresponding deficit/surplus recognised in the unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income.

# 4.9.1 Deposits - Islamic Banking

Deposits are generated on the basis of two modes i.e. Qard and Modaraba. Deposits taken on Qard basis are classified as 'Current Account' and Deposits generated on Modaraba basis are classified as 'Savings Account' and 'Fixed Deposit Accounts'. No profit or loss is passed on to current account depositors. Profits realised in investment pools are distributed in pre-agreed profit sharing ratio. Rab-ul-Maal (Customer) share is distributed among depositors according to weightages assigned at the inception of profit calculation period. Mudarib (Bank) can distribute its share of profit to Rab-ul-Maal upto a specified percentage of its profit. Profits are distributed from the pool so the depositors (remunerative) only bear the risk of assets in the pool during the profit calculation period. Asset pools are created at the discretion and the Bank can add, amend, transfer an asset to any other pool in the interests of the deposit holders. In case of loss in a pool during the profit calculation period, the loss is distributed among the depositors (remunerative) according to their ratio of Investments.

# 4.14.3 Deferred

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for the taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities using the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available and the credits can be utilised. Deferred tax asset is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realised.

The difference between the carrying value and the recoverable value is recognised through the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account as a deferred tax expense. The Bank also records a deferred tax asset / liability on items recognised directly in the unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income such as surplus / deficit on revaluation of assets. Deferred tax liability is not recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with exchange translation reserves of foreign branches, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

# 4.15 Impairment of non-financial assets

The carrying amount of assets is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable at each reporting date. If any event exists, the recoverable amount of such assets is estimated and impairment losses are recognised immediately in these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 4.20 Derivative financial instruments

Derivatives assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value through profit and loss except for derivatives that are in a designated hedge accounting relationship.

Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when transactions meet the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness, the Bank applies fair value hedge accounting or cash flow hedge accounting as appropriate to the risks being hedged.

The Bank has elected to apply hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 Instruments: and for derivatives designated as hedging instruments as allowed under paragraph 7.2.21 of IFRS 9. Subsequent measurement of derivatives designated as hedging instrument depends on whether the hedge is designated as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge as explained below:

# Fair value hedge

Changes in fair value of derivatives (hedge instrument) that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges are recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account, together with changes in the fair value of hedged assets (hedged item) that are attributable to hedged risk. The fair value changes of the hedged asset or liability adjust their carrying value and are also recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account except for equity instruments carried at FVOCI where the adjustment is included in other comprehensive income.

If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedge accounting is discontinued. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is immediately recognised in profit and loss.

## Chunk 817


# Cash flow hedge

For qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially in other comprehensive income and then recycled to the statement of profit and loss account in the periods when the hedged item will affect the profit or loss. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the statement of profit and loss account immediately.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the hedged item ultimately affects or is recognised in statement of profit and loss account. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the statement of profit and loss account.

# Measuring Hedge Effectiveness

For a hedge to qualify for hedge accounting, it must be highly effective, with changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument expected to offset those of the hedged item within a range of Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent it occurs, is recognised in profit or loss. A hedging instrument is a financial instrument used to offset changes in the fair value or cash flows of a designated hedged item, which may be a recognised asset, liability, or an unrecognised firm commitment exposed to specific risks.

# 4.21 Acceptances

# 21.3 Statutory reserve

A Banking company incorporated in Pakistan is required to transfer 20% of its profit after tax to a statutory reserve until the amount of the reserve plus share premium equals the paid-up share capital. Thereafter, 10% of the profit after tax of the banking company is required to be transferred to this reserve. Accordingly, the Bank transfers 10% of its profit after tax every year.

# 39.15 Risks associated with defined benefit plans

Asset volatility: The risk arises due to the inclusion of the risky assets in the gratuity fund portfolio, inflation and interest rate volatility.

Changes in bond yields: The risk arises when bond yield is lower than the expected return on the plan assets (duration based PIB discount rate).

Inflation risks: The risk arises if gratuity benefits are linked to inflation and the inflation is higher than expected, which results in higher liabilities.

Life expectancy / withdrawal risk: The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

Longevity risks: The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population.

Salary increase risk: The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the benefit is linked with final salary. The risk arises when the actual increases in salary are higher than expectation and impacts the liability accordingly.

# 43 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as amortised cost / held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted debt securities classified as amortised cost / held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of valuation methodologies. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 43.1 Fair value of financial instruments

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 43.3.2 Valuation techniques

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Market Treasury Bills (MTB) / Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIB), and GoP Sukuks|The fair value of MTBs and PIBs are derived using PKRV rates. Floating rate PIBs are revalued using PKFRV rates. The fair value of GoP sukuk listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange has been determined through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange. The fair value of other GIS are revalued using PKISRV rates.|
|Overseas Sukuks, Overseas and GoP Euro Bonds|The fair value of overseas government sukuks, and overseas bonds are determined on the basis of price available on Bloomberg.|
|Debt Securities (TFCs and Sukuk other than Government)|Investment in sukuks, debt securities (comprising term finance certificates, bonds and any other security issued by a company or a body corporate for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.|
|Ordinary shares - listed|The fair value of investments in listed equity securities are valued on the basis of closing quoted market price available at the Pakistan Stock Exchange.|
|Ordinary shares - unlisted|The fair value of investments in certain unlisted equity securities are valued on the basis of dividend discount model.|
|Preference shares - unlisted|The fair value of investment in unlisted preference shares are valued at offer quoted price.|
|Redeemable participating certificates|The fair value of investment in redeemable participating certificates are valued at net asset value.|
|Advances|The fair value of advances are valued on the basis of cashflow discount model.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the FX revaluation rates announced by the SBP.|
|Derivative instruments|Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques based on market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.|
|Property and equipment and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|The valuation experts used a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank's properties. The market approach used prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical, comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty accordingly a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these unconsolidated financial statements.|

The following table summarises the quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in level 3 fair value measurements of investment and advances, (The valuation techniques are stated above):

|Description|Fair value as at December 31, 2024|Unobservable inputs*|Discount Rate|Relationship of unobservable inputs to fair value|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Ordinary shares - unlisted|2,333,188|Discount rate|17.2%|Increase / (decrease) in discount rate by 1% with all other variables held constant, would (decrease) / increase the fair value by Rs. 90.457 million and Rs. 97.873 million respectively.|
|Preference shares - unlisted|500,000|Offered quote|Not applicable|Not applicable|
|Redeemable participating certificates|8,315,048|Net asset value|Not applicable|Not applicable|
|Advances|1,413,735|Discount rate|30.0%|Increase / (decrease) in discount rate by 1% with all other variables held constant, would (decrease) / increase the fair value by Rs. 14.903 million and Rs. 15.134 million respectively.|

* There were no significant inter-relationships between unobservable inputs that materially affect fair values.

# 48 RISK MANAGEMENT

The variety of business activities undertaken by the Bank require effective identification, measurement, monitoring, integration and management of different financial and non-financial risks that are constantly evolving as business activities change in response to concurrent internal and external developments. The Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) is appointed and authorised by the Board of Directors (BOD) to assist in design, regularly evaluating and timely updating the risk management framework of the Bank. The Board has further authorised the management committees i.e. Central Management Committee (CMC), Central Credit Committee (CCC) and Digital Council to supervise risk management activities within their respective scopes. CMC has further established sub-committees such as Assets & Liabilities Committee (ALCO), Investment Committee (IC), Information Technology Steering Committee (ITSC), Control & Compliance Committee (C&CC), Process Improvement Committee (PIC) and Governance Committee for Overseas Operations etc.

The risk management framework endeavours to be a comprehensive and evolving guideline to cater to changing business dynamics. The framework includes:

- Clearly defined risk management policies, procedures, responsibilities and accountabilities;
- Well constituted organisational structure, in the form of separate risk management departments within the Credit and Risk Management Group, which ensure that individuals responsible for risk approval are independent from risk taking units i.e. Business Units;
- Mechanism for ongoing review of policies and procedures and risk exposures.

The primary objective of this architecture is to inculcate risk management into the organisation flows to ensure that risks are accurately identified & assessed, properly documented, approved, and adequately monitored & managed in order to enhance the risk management framework which has a well-defined organisational structure for effective management of credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, information security risk, trade pricing, environment and social risk. Further, there is an advanced focus on optimal utilisation of capital while ensuring compliance with capital requirements. The results of stress tests and internal capital adequacy assessment process and recovery plans are given due consideration in capital and business planning.

# 48.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk is the identification of probability that counterparty will cause a financial loss to the Bank due to its inability or unwillingness to meet its contractual obligation. This credit risk arises mainly from lending, hedging, settlement and other financial transactions. The credit risk management processes encompass identification, assessment, measurement, monitoring and control of the Bank's exposure to credit risk. The credit risk management philosophy is based on the overall business strategy / direction as established by the Board. The Bank is committed to the appropriate level of due diligence to ensure that credit risks have been properly analysed, fully disclosed to the approving authorities and appropriately quantified, also ensuring that the credit commitment is appropriately structured, priced (in line with market practices) and documented.

The Bank has built and maintained a sound loan portfolio in terms of well-defined credit policy approved by the Board of Directors (BOD). Its credit evaluation system comprises of well-designed credit appraisal, sanctioning and review procedures for prudence in lending activities and ensuring the high quality of asset portfolio. In order to have an effective and efficient risk assessment, and to closely align its functions with Business, Credit Division has separate units for Corporate banking, Islamic banking, Retail & SME banking (including Agricultural financing) and Overseas Operations & Financial Institutions. For Consumer & Digital products, loans are booked against defined eligibility criteria as per product programs / credit policy and these have a separate credit risk function.

The Bank manages its portfolio of loan assets with a view to limit concentrations in terms of risk quality, industry, maturity and large exposure. Portfolio analysis is also conducted on regular basis. This portfolio level oversight is maintained by the Credit & Risk Management Group.

For domestic operations, the Bank determines the amount for provisions / expected credit loss as per the IFRS 9 guidelines / Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP and the management best estimates. Provisions at overseas branches are held to meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities of the respective countries in which the overseas branches operates. A sophisticated internal credit rating system is in place, which is capable of quantifying counter-party and transaction risk in accordance with the best practices. The risk rating system takes into consideration qualitative and quantitative factors of the counter-party, transaction structure & security and generates internal ratings at obligor and facility levels. Furthermore, this system has an integrated loan origination module, which is currently being used in Corporate Banking, Islamic Banking and Retail segments. The system is regularly reviewed for improvements as per the SBP's guidelines for Internal Credit Rating and Risk Management.

The risk rating system incorporates comprehensive obligor risk rating models for the Corporate, Commercial, Small & Medium Enterprises, Agricultural, and Project Finance portfolios. These models are designed using a diverse array of qualitative and quantitative variables, each assigned specific weights or scores. The aggregate score of these variables is mapped to determine the final obligor risk rating. Additionally, the scorecard-based models include a provision for management-level overrides, enabling the incorporation of any critical information or risk factors into the final assessment.

Furthermore, the Bank also validates Internal Ratings based on statistical tests for all portfolios. It covers both discrimination and calibration statistical tests as per best practices. The system is backed by secured database with backup support and is capable of generating MIS reports providing snapshot of the entire portfolio for strategizing and decision making. The system is enhanced to compute the ECL calculation for IFRS 9 and risk weighted assets for quarterly credit risk related Basel submissions.

A centralised Credit Administration Division (CAD) under Credit and Risk Management Group is working towards ensuring that terms of approval of credit sanctions and regulatory stipulations are complied with, all documentation including security documentation is regular and fully enforceable and all disbursements of approved facilities are made only after necessary authorisation by CAD.

Credit Policy and Portfolio Management under Credit and Risk Management Group keeps a watch on the quality of the credit portfolio in terms of borrowers' behaviour, identifies weakening accounts relationships and report them to the appropriate authorities with a view to address further deterioration.

To handle the specialised requirements of managing delinquent and problem accounts, the Bank has a separate client facing unit to negotiate repayment / settlement of the non-performing exposure and protect the interests of the depositors and stakeholders. The priority of the Special Asset Management Group (SAMG) is recovery of amounts and / or to structure an arrangement (such as rescheduling, restructuring, settlement or a combination of these) by which the interests of the Bank are protected. Where no other recourse is possible, SAMG may proceed with legal recourse so as to maximise the recovery of the assets. The Credit and Risk Management Group also monitors the NPL portfolio of the Bank and reports the same to CCC / BRMC.

# 48.1.1 Credit risk - general disclosures Basel specific

The Bank is using Standardised Approach (SA) of the SBP's Basel accord for the purpose of estimating credit risk weighted assets. Under SA, banks are allowed to take into consideration external rating(s) of counter-parties for the purpose of calculating risk weighted assets. A detailed procedural manual specifying processes for deriving Credit Risk Weighted Assets in accordance with the SBP Basel Standardised Approach is in place and firmly adhered to by the Bank.

# 48.1.2 Disclosures for portfolio subject to the standardised approach & supervisory risk weights

# 48.1.2.1 External ratings

The SBP Basel III guidelines require banks to use ratings assigned by specified External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) namely Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA), VIS and Moody's, Fitch and Standard & Poor's. The SBP through its letter number BSD/BAI-2/201/1200/2009 dated December 21, 2009 accorded approval to the Bank for use of ratings assigned by Credit Rating Agency of Bangladesh (CRAB) and Credit Rating Information and Services Limited (CRISL). The Bank uses these ECAIs to rate its exposures denominated in Bangladeshi currency on certain corporate exposures and banks incorporated in Bangladesh.

468 | ANNUAL REPORT 2024

The Bank uses external ratings for the purpose of mapping risk weights as per the Basel III framework. Instances whereby an exposure is rated by two or more ratings agencies, mapping into different risk weights, instructions outlined in Regulatory guidelines on BASEL framework shall be adhered to for selection of applicable rating.

# 48.1.3.2 Collateral valuation and management

As stipulated in the SBP Basel guidelines, the Bank uses the comprehensive approach for collateral valuation. Under this approach, the Bank reduces its credit exposure to a counterparty when calculating its capital requirements to the extent of risk mitigation provided by the eligible financial collateral as specified in the Basel guidelines. In line with Basel guidelines, the Bank makes adjustments in eligible collaterals for possible future fluctuations in the value of the collateral. These adjustments, also referred to as to produce volatility adjusted amounts for collateral, are reduced from the exposure to compute the capital charge based on the applicable risk weights.

# 48.1.3.3 Types of collaterals

The Bank determines the appropriate collateral for each facility based on the type of product and counterparty. In case of corporate and SME financing, fixed assets are generally taken as security for long tenure loans and current assets for working capital finance usually backed by mortgage or hypothecation. For project finance, security of the assets of the borrowers and assignment of the underlying project contracts are generally obtained. Additional security such as pledge of shares, cash collateral, TDRs, SSC/DSCs, charge on receivables may also be obtained. Moreover, in order to cover the entire exposure personal guarantees of directors / borrowers are also obtained generally by the Bank. For retail products, the security to be taken is defined in the product policy for the respective products. Housing loans and automobile loans are secured by the property and automobile being financed respectively. The Bank also offers products which are primarily based on collateral such as shares, specified securities and pledged commodities. These products are offered in line with the SBP prudential regulations and approved product policies which also deal with types of collateral, valuation and margining. The decision on the type and quantum of collateral for each transaction is taken by the credit approving authority as per the credit approval authorisation approved by the CCC under its delegation powers. For facilities provided as per approved product policies (retail products, loan against shares etc.), collateral is taken in line with the policy.

# 48.1.3.4 Types of eligible financial collateral

For credit risk mitigation purposes (capital adequacy purposes), the Bank considers all types of financial collaterals that are eligible under the SBP Basel III accord. This includes cash / TDRs, gold, securities issued by Government of Pakistan such as T-Bills and PIBs, National Savings Certificates, certain debt securities rated by recognised credit rating agencies, mutual fund units where daily Net Asset Value (NAV) is available in public domain and guarantees from certain specified entities (Government of Pakistan, Banks etc.) under substitution effect of Basel.

# 48.1.3.5 Credit concentration risk

Credit concentration risk arises mainly due to concentration of exposures under various categories viz. industry, geography, and single/group borrower exposures. Within credit portfolio, as a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of risks, the SBP has prescribed regulatory limits on maximum exposure to single borrower, group borrowers and related parties. Moreover, in order to restrict the industry concentration risk, annual credit plan spells out the maximum allowable exposure that it can take on specific industry. Additionally, the Internal Rating System allows the Bank to monitor risk rating concentration of borrowers against different grades / scores ranging from 1 - 12 (1 being the best and 12 being loss category).

Particulars of the Bank's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet credit risk in various sectors are analysed as follows:

# 48.1.3.6 Methodologies and models used for the measurement of Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD).

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal / external rating grade for subject customer. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer / facility to the watch list, or the account being restructured. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 60 days past due. When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Bank applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its financial instruments into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

When financial instruments are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-months default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the forward looking LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

# Stage 2 (Underperforming assets):

When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

# Stage 3 (Non performing assets):

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises LTECLs for these instruments. A description of how the Bank defines credit-impaired and default is given in relevant section. The Bank uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP.

# Undrawn financing commitments

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the financings are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. For revolving facilities that include both financings and an undrawn commitment, ECLs are calculated on un-drawn portion (after application of CCF) of the facility and presented within other liabilities.

The Bank estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven and internally developed credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit contracts respectively. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within other liabilities.

# Forward looking information

The Bank has performed historical analysis and identified the key economic variables impacting credit risk and expected credit losses for Wholesale & Retail portfolio. These economic variables and their associated impact on the PD vary by the portfolio.

The rating band / DPD bucket wise PDs are computed through migration analysis using at least 5 years historical transition matrices of respective portfolio. Furthermore, a detailed regression analysis is carried out using Macro Economic variables (i.e. Average Inflation rate and GDP Growth rate were regressed against Bank's Internal Default Rates) in order to attain forward-looking PDs for each following year.

In addition to the base economic scenario, the Bank also uses other possible scenarios along with scenario weightings. The number of scenarios and their attributes are reassessed at each reporting date. The scenario weightings are determined by a combination of statistical analysis and expert credit judgment, taking account of the range of possible outcomes each chosen scenario is representative of.

For expected credit loss provisions modelled on a collective basis, a grouping of exposures is performed on the basis of shared risk characteristics, such that risk exposures within a group are homogeneous.

In its ECL models, the Bank relies on a range of the following forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

# The Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is measured on either a 12-month (12M) or Lifetime basis depending on whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred since initial recognition or whether an asset is considered to be credit-impaired. Expected credit losses are the discounted product of the Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD), discounted at an approximation to the EIR, defined as follows:

# Probability of Default (PD)

The Probability of default (PD) represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation, either over the next 12 months (12M PD), or over the remaining lifetime (Lifetime PD) of the obligation.

- For corporate, commercial, SME and agriculture loan portfolios (collectively referred to as the Bank has used an obligor risk rating (ORR) transition based approach to determine the segment wise PDs for each ORR.
- For auto loans, housing, personal installment loans and credit cards (collectively referred to as a days-past-due based migration approach has been used; and these PD's for wholesale & retail portfolio are then adjusted with forward looking information to arrive at point in time (PIT) PDs;
- For other financial assets (i.e. investments, lending to financial institutions, balances with other banks etc.), historical PDs were estimated on the basis of global default Rates taken from S&P rating-wise transition matrices. These annual default Rates were converted into forward-looking PDs using the Vasicek model. The forecast global macro-economic variables were derived using historical regression between global macro-economic variables and Pakistan macro-economic variables.

# Exposure at Default (EAD)

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has a legal right to call it earlier. The product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail facilities, in which the Bank has the right to cancel and/or reduce the facilities with one day notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Bank does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

# Loss Given Default (LGD)

LGD represents an estimate of the loss incurred on a facility in the event of default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive. It is expressed as a percentage of the EAD. The Bank has estimated segment wise LGDs for Corporate/Commercial, SE, ME & Agri Portfolio as well as product wise LGDs for Auto Finance, Personal Loan, Home Finance and Credit Card portfolio. The LGDs are determined using a workout approach, based on vintage recovery data for the defaulted portfolio; these recoveries are then discounted back to the date of default, to factor in time value of money.

The Bank has converted the estimates for segment/product wise historical LGDs (Through the cycle LGDs) into forward looking point in time LGDs, through use of term structure of Point in time PDs.

# 48.1.3.7 ECL Principles, Grouping and Calculations

The ECL is determined by projecting the PD, LGD and EAD for each future repayment date and for each individual exposure. These three components are multiplied together, effectively calculating an ECL for each future repayment date, which is then discounted back to the reporting date and summed.

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective interest rate (at reporting date), the Bank uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date).

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three scenarios (a base, best and a worst case). Each of these scenario's is based on different macro-economic forecasts and is associated with different set of PDs & LGD.

Furthermore, to mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The Bank considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics:

- History of legal certainty & enforceability
- History of recovery

The Bank's management has only considered cash, liquid securities, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals, while calculating EADs. Furthermore, The credit exposure (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

# Impact on Regulatory Capital:

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the Banks, which has reduced their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has permitted Banks to opt for transitional arrangement for the ECL impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the 'Application Instructions' issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement.

|Key Ratios|With Transitional arrangement| |Without Transitional arrangement|
|---|---|---|---|
|Total Capital to total RWA (CAR)|17.96%| |17.69%|
|Leverage Ratio|3.86%| |3.78%|

# 48.1.3.8 ECL Modeling and staging criteria/ Significant increase in ECLs

Significant increase in credit risk (SICR): A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument compared to the risk of default expected at the time of initial recognition. The Bank uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR including, inter alia, the deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR), in line with Bank's internally approved grid outlining specific notches downgrade for each ORR / external rating, payments being past due by 60 days, and other qualitative factors (such as watchlisting or restructuring of account).

# 48.1.4 Loans and advances definitions and methodologies of categorisation, credit loss allowance stages and movements between stages

Backward Transition: In line with Bank's IFRS 9 Policy and Regulatory guidelines, financial assets shall be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they fulfill the criteria outlined in the Prudential Regulations (PR) issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Similarly, financial assets classified under Stage 2 shall be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) no longer exist. However, a minimum period of three months from the initial downgrade is mandatory before any facility can be moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2.

For a facility to transition from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it must meet the declassification requirements specified in the relevant Prudential Regulations. An exposure cannot be directly upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1; instead, it must first transition to Stage 2 and subsequently complete a cooling-off period of three months before being reclassified to Stage 1.

# 48.2      Market Risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to movements in market prices. It results from changes in interest rates, exchange rates and equity prices as well as from changes in the correlations between them. To manage and control market risk, a comprehensive Board approved Market & Liquidity Risk Management Policy, is in place. The policy outlines a well-defined risk control structure, responsibilities of relevant stakeholders with respect to market risk management and methods to measure and control market risk at a portfolio level. These controls include limits on exposure to individual market risk variables as well as limits on concentrations of tenors. This structure is reviewed, adjusted and approved periodically.

Under the BoD approved policy, the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) and Investment Committee (IC) are primarily responsible for the oversight of market risk, supported by Market & Liquidity Risk Department of Risk Management Division (RMD). Furthermore, the Bank carries out risk assessment via diversified tools including Value at Risk (VaR), PVBP (Price Value per Basis Point) and Duration on a regular basis. The Bank also ascertains the impact of market risk on relevant portfolios through stress testing and the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment processes.

# 48.3      Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange (FX) risk arises from fluctuation in the value of financial instruments due to changes in foreign exchange. The Bank manages FX risk by setting and monitoring through approved currency wise net open position limits and Foreign Exchange Exposure Limit (FEEL). Foreign exchange risk is controlled and monitored through limits approved by ALCO, within the overall FEEL limit advised by the SBP.

# 48.3.2 Equity position risk

Equity position risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in the prices of individual stocks or market indices. The equity investments are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) / available for sale (AFS) and fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) / held for trading (HFT) investments. The objective of classifying investments as FVPL / HFT is to take advantage of short term capital gains, while the FVOCI / AFS portfolio is maintained with a medium term view of capital gains and dividend income. The Investment Committee is primarily responsible for the oversight of the equity investment risk. The Bank has an active and regular monitoring mechanism for utilisation against approved portfolio limits, scrip wise limits, sector limits, loss triggers and timely escalation of Management Action Trigger Levels (MAT).

# Yield / Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)-Basel II Specific

Interest Rate Risk is the adverse impact on the bank's shareholder's equity due to changes in the interest rates. It may be further elaborated as changes in the present value of the asset, liabilities and commitments due to changes in interest rates, including changes in the shape of yield curves. The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of mismatches in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet interest sensitive instruments within a certain range of maturity or re-pricing (whichever is earlier). The Bank has formulated a separate Interest Rate Risk Management (IRRM) framework which establishes aggregate and tenor-wise balance sheet level PVBP (Price Value per basis points) limits to manage interest rate risk within the Board approved risk appetite. Treasury and Capital Markets Group is primarily responsible for management of interest rate risk on a daily basis, and the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) oversees the interest rate risk at Bank level. Market Risk Department of Risk Management Division independently monitors, analyses and reports various limits including management action point limits and re-pricing of the assets and liabilities on a regular basis.

# 48.5 Operational Risk

Basel defines Operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.

The Operational Risk Management Framework, policy and Standards of the Bank duly approved by the Central Management Committee and the Board, cover the processes, structure and functions of operational risk management and provides guidelines to identify, assess, monitor, control and report operational risk in a consistent and transparent manner across the Bank.

# 48.5.1 Operational Risk Disclosures - Basel Specific

The Bank is among the first few banks in the industry to secure the SBP approval for adoption of Alternative Standardized Approach (ASA) under Basel guidelines for determining capital charge on operational risk in December 2013. The Bank started calculating its capital charge for operational risk using ASA from December 31, 2013.

The SBP approval stipulated a capital floor i.e. operational risk charge under ASA should not fall below as a certain percentage of operational risk capital charge calculated under Basic Indicator Approach for initial three years. These floors were 90% for 2013 and 2014, 80% for 2015 and 70% for 2016. However, removal of capital floor for calculation of capital charge under ASA was extended in line with international developments and consultations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).

Embedding a sustainable risk culture remains our core objective, which includes effective management of operational issues and emerging risks across the Bank and in our overseas operations via deployment of required resources, tools and continuous supervision. The new Operational Risk Framework, Policy and Standards, duly approved by the Board, have been rolled out along with new system platforms (Operational Risk System) for recording and tracking of risk events, including non-financial risks. The Bank is implementing a new process and risk based Risk & Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) mechanism to ensure effective assessment of controls and to manage operational risks within the organization. The Bank has also deployed the First Line Operational Risk teams to perform controls self-assessments and reviews, especially for the processes and activities, that may significantly impact the risk appetite. Furthermore, new and amended products, systems, activities and processes are subject to comprehensive operational risk assessments before implementation and launch.

# 48.5.2 Information Security Risk

Cyber risk is now amongst the top ranked risks that all organizations face and the Bank is cognizant of its significance and possible impacts. The Board IT Committee (BITC) and management level IT Steering Committee (ITSC) provide oversight of cyber security matters. The Bank has in place a well-defined Information Security Risk Management Policy / Framework, duly approved by the Board of Directors. The framework is supplemented with comprehensive Information Security Risk Management procedures approved by the executive management. The framework is directly aligned with regulatory advisories and international standards, as well as best practices.

A dedicated Information Security Division within the Credit & Risk Management Group is responsible for managing information security risks to the Bank's information assets. This division ensures compliance with established information security standards and baselines, continuously monitors cyber threats, and investigates security incidents through a purpose-built Security Operations Centre, which operates 24/7/365 days.

Through periodic Cyber Security Risk Assessments, the Bank has implemented a multi-layered Cybersecurity Action Plan that addresses all key domains of information security. Identified threats and vulnerabilities are appropriately mitigated and revalidated. Additionally, the Bank regularly conducts Cyber Risk awareness campaigns for both staff and customers, and has established clear standards for the Acceptable Use of Information and Technology Resources.

# 48.5.3 Environmental Risk

The Bank has integrated sustainable finance approach in its lending activities. In this regard, Green Banking Policy and Environmental & Social Management System (ESMS) have been put in place.

The ESMS Framework essentially requires that any relevant lending opportunity is to be reviewed and evaluated under:

- International Finance Corporation exclusion list;
- Applicable national laws on environment, health, safety and social issues; and
- International Finance Corporation performance standards.

This framework is an integral part of the credit approval process. All relevant credit proposals require Environmental & Social review prior to approval of the competent authority.

During 2022, the SBP has issued Environmental & Social Risk Management (ESRM) Implementation Manual, based on IFC performance standards, which is applicable to all banks in Pakistan. From November 20, 2023, our Bank has implemented the afore-mentioned SBP manual in letter and spirit.

# 48.5.4 Country Risk

Country risk refers to the possibility that economic and political conditions in a foreign country could adversely impact the exposure in that country. For the Bank, country risk arises as a result of the net investment in foreign operations, foreign currency lending, trade and treasury business with counterparties domiciled in other countries as well as investments and capital transactions. In order to manage the risk, Bank has in place a comprehensive country risk management framework. Under this framework, the transfer risk is measured using financial market and economic factors. Political risk is measured using a variety of indicia indicative of willingness to honour its foreign obligations. Based on this framework, risk limits are assigned to countries within the Board approved limits. The limits and their utilisation are monitored and managed at head office level and country risk exposures are reported to the relevant committees at a defined frequency.

# 48.6 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity is a financial capacity to meet its obligations as they fall due without incurring losses. Liquidity risk is the risk to an earnings, capital and reputation arising from its inability (real or perceived) to meet its contractual obligations in a timely manner without incurring unacceptable losses when they come due.

With reference to the SBP Basel III Liquidity Standards issued under BPRD circular # 08 dated June 23, 2016, the Bank calculates Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) on a monthly basis. Based on the financial statements as at December 31, 2024, the LCR is 1.35 or 135% against the SBP minimum requirement of 100%, with Total Stock of High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) of Rs. 1,002,124.577 million and Net Cash Outflows of Rs. 741,767.855 million.

Moreover, under the same circular the Banks are expected to calculate Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) on quarterly basis. Based on December 31, 2024 numbers the NSFR is 1.26 or 126% against SBP minimum requirement of 100%, with Total Available Stable Funding of Rs. 1,690,754.449 million and Total Required Stable Funding of Rs. 1,340,991.900 million.

The Bank manages and controls liquidity risk through a detailed risk management framework, which includes BoD approved policy, the management level procedural document and Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) level guidelines. Under this framework, various liquidity metrics are implemented and monitored on a regular basis.

The Board approves the overall liquidity risk appetite and broad liquidity risk strategy through Annual Business Plan. The ALCO is primarily responsible for the implementation of Board's strategy through oversight of the asset liability function including liquidity management. Treasury front office manages the liquidity on day to day basis and is the first line of defence against liquidity risk. Under Risk Management Division, Liquidity Risk Management Department is responsible for independent monitoring of the overall liquidity risk in line with regulatory requirements and own risk appetite.

The overall funding strategy is based on the principles of diversification and stability. The Bank has a diverse funding base, which includes stable funding in the form of equity, sub-ordinated loans, retail and small business deposits and non-stable funding in form of large volume depositors. The Bank has in place internally approved limits to monitor and manage risk emanating from volatile funding concentration. Moreover, the Bank is fully compliant with Basel III LCR and NSFR, which ensure sufficient stock of high quality liquidity assets in relation to its liability profile.

Stress testing is used in an attempt to highlight the vulnerability of the balance sheet to hypothetical stress events and scenarios. Based on the scenarios, liquidity risk factors are given major shocks and their resulting impact on the balance sheet is calculated. The Bank carries out the stress testing based on SBP stress tests and internal defined scenarios to gauge the potential impacts of different liquidity stress scenarios and share the results with the senior management, the BoD and the regulator.

At the Bank, Contingency Funding Plan (CFP), are in place for all jurisdictions to address liquidity issues in times of stress / crises situations. The Treasury division prepares the CFPs for all operations on annual basis for identifying the stress scenarios and the funding plan for such scenarios along with early warning indicators. These plans are reviewed by the Risk Management Division and are approved by the ALCO annually.

Main drivers of LCR results are High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) and Net Cash Outflow. HQLA is defined by the liquidity quality of the assets and net cash outflow is mainly determined through volatility of the liability profile.

|HQLA*|Market Value|Weighted Amount|
|---|---|---|
|Level 1 Assets|990,177,457|990,177,457|
|Level 2A Assets|3,174,211|2,698,080|
|Level 2B Assets|17,572,037|9,249,041|
| |1,010,923,705|1,002,124,578|

* These have been defined in detail in the SBP Circular No. 08, dated June 23, 2016.

In line with the SBP BSD Circular Letter No. 03 of 2011 on "Maturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity Gap Reporting" the Bank conducted a behavioural study of non-maturity deposits (non-contractual deposits) and performed regression analysis to determine deposit withdrawal pattern on Current and Savings Accounts (CASA). Regression analysis is used to investigate the relationship between time, the amount of deposits and deposits withdrawals in order to arrive at an estimated deposits withdrawals pattern. This methodology is in line with the industry best practices and regulatory guidance.

# 48.7 Derivative Risk

The Bank deals in derivative instruments including Interest Rate Swaps and Cross Currency Swaps for hedging and market
making purposes within risk appetite. Interest rate swaps are primarily conducted to hedge interest rate risk present in
the Bank's foreign currency bond portfolio.

Additionally, to facilitate client business enabling them to hedge long term foreign currency exposure, the bank offers solutions
through Cross Currency Swaps subject to approval from the State Bank of Pakistan. The counterparty risk associated in the
cross currency swaps is approved by the relevant Credit Approval Authority.

currency bonds portfolio against interest rate swaps on a periodic basis. For Cross Currency Swaps, Market & Liquidity Risk
Department monitors the revaluation and counterparty exposures on a regular basis. The results are then shared with the
concerned stakeholders and strategies are devised/revisited in coordination with Treasury to align the outcomes with
established risk parameters.

# 49 AFGHANISTAN OPERATIONS

Bank Alfalah maintains a two-branch presence in Afghanistan. The Board and the management of the Bank continue to closely
monitor the evolving situation in Afghanistan which has been hampered due to the country's frozen reserves and uncertainty
regarding international recognition which prevent normal flows in and out of Afghanistan. The Bank has taken impairment
against net assets where there is an indication that carrying amount may be higher than its recoverable amount. The Bank

# DISCLOSURES PLS POOL MANAGEMENT- ISLAMIC BANKING GROUP (IBG)

# A-II.2

1. The pools, their key features and risk and reward characteristics.

The profit and loss sharing between the Rabbul Maal (depositor) and Mudarib (Bank - IBG) is based upon the underlying principles of Mudaraba, where the Bank also contributes its equity to general pool of funds, and becomes the capital provider.

Currently IBG is managing following pools:

1. General Pool for LCY Depositors
2. FCY Pool for Foreign Currency (USD, GBP, EURO, AED, SAR and CAD) depositors
3. FIs Pool for Treasury Purposes
4. IERS Pool for Islamic Export Refinance Scheme facilities
5. Special pool
6. PMRC Musharikah Pool

All the Mudaraba based remunerative deposits shall be considered as an investment from Rabbul Maal in the pool, along with IBG's own share of equity, which is also commingled in the pool. The applications of these funds are on Islamic financing and related assets, investments, and placements for generating profits to be shared among the depositors as per the weightage system.

The IERS pool is maintained as per the guideline under the SBP IERS Scheme.

The assets, liabilities, equities, income and expenses are segregated for each of the pool. No pool investment is intermingled with each other. All pools are usually exposed to general credit risk, asset ownership risk and profit rate risk of the underlying assets involved in pool.

2. Avenues/sectors where Mudaraba based deposits have been deployed.

# Key Audit Matter

|S.No.|Key Audit Matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|Credit loss allowance against advances: (Refer notes 4.3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements)|The Group records credit loss allowance against advances in Pakistan operations in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan and as per the instructions of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Under IFRS 9, the Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the Expected Credit Losses ('ECL') associated with the advances. A lifetime ECL is recorded on advances in which there have been a Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) from the date of initial recognition and on advances which are credit impaired as on the reporting date. A 12 months ECL is recorded for advances which do not meet the criteria for SICR or "credit impaired" as at the reporting date. To assess whether there is a significant increase in the credit risk, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the advances as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. Both lifetime and 12 months ECL are calculated at facility level. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to the consolidated statement of profit and loss account and is decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. The Group records charge for Stage 3 based on the higher of provision under the Prudential Regulations or ECL under IFRS 9, as per the instructions of the SBP. This assessment is conducted at the facility level for corporate, commercial, and SME loan portfolios, and at a segment level for the retail portfolio. If one facility of a counterparty becomes 90+ days past due (DPD) or is otherwise defined as impaired under the Prudential Regulations, all other facilities of that counterparty are classified as Stage 3. The measurement of ECL involves evaluating a range of possible outcomes, considering the time value of money, and incorporating reasonable and supportable information available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions. The net provision made/reversed during the year is charged to the consolidated statement of profit and loss account and accumulated provision is netted-off against advances. Provisions pertaining to overseas advances are made in accordance with the requirements of the regulatory authorities of the respective countries. The Group has recognised a net credit loss allowance/provision against advances amounting to Rs. 1,861.171 million in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account in the current year. As at December 31, 2024, the Group holds a credit loss allowance/provision of Rs. 46,886.368 million against advances.|

|1|The determination of credit loss allowance / provision against advances based on the above criteria remains a significant area of judgment and estimation. Because of the significance of the impact of these judgments / estimations and the materiality of advances relative to the overall consolidated financial statements of the Group, we considered this area as a key audit matter.|We issued instructions to auditors of those overseas branches which were selected for audit, highlighting ‘Credit loss allowance against advances’ as a significant risk. The auditors of those branches performed audit procedures to check compliance with regulatory requirements and reported the results thereof to us. We, as auditors of the Group, evaluated the work performed by the component auditors and the results thereof.|

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan and Companies Act, 2017 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

•  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

•  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

•  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

•  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

•  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Noman Abbas Sheikh.

# 2.3 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards comprise of:

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS Accounting Standards) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the SBP and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IFRS or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives have been followed.

The SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment Property' for banking companies through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002 till further instructions. Further, the SECP has deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' on banks through its notification S.R.O 411(I)/2008 dated April 28, 2008. The SBP through BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2015 dated February 25, 2015 had deferred the applicability of Islamic Financial Accounting Standard-3 for Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits (IFAS-3) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) and notified by the SECP, vide their SRO No. 571 of 2013 dated June 12, 2013 for Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services (IIFS). Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.

The SBP has issued BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 dated January 22, 2025 in which certain relaxations / clarifications have been provided upon adoption of IFRS 9 which are disclosed in note 4.1 to the consolidated financial statements. As allowed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022, IFRS 9 has not been adopted for overseas branches where it is not applicable as per their local regulations for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 13 dated July 01, 2024, issued the revised forms for the preparation of the annual financial statements of the Banks / DFIs which are applicable for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 as per BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023. The implementation of the revised forms has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of these consolidated financial statements. The significant change is relating to right of use assets and corresponding lease liability which are now presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position. Previously, these were presented under property and equipment (earlier titled as fixed assets) and other liabilities respectively. There is no impact of this change on the consolidated financial statements in terms of recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities.

The Holding Company has adopted the above changes in the presentation and made additional disclosures to the extent applicable to its operations and corresponding figures have been rearranged / reclassified to correspond to the current period presentation, as presented in note 54.1.

Moreover, Alfalah Insurance Company Limited has deferred the application of IFRS 9 till January 01, 2026, which is same as effective date for application of IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts as allowed by the SECP through S.R.O. 506(i)/2024 dated March 29, 2024. Furthermore, Sapphire Wind Power Company Limited was granted a partial exemption from the application of IFRS 9 till December 31, 2024 vide SECP S.R.O.67(i)/2023 dated January 20, 2023. Consequently, the requirements of IFRS 9 with respect to application of Expected Credit Losses in respect of trade debts and other receivables due from Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA-G) have not been followed.

# 2.3.1 Basis of consolidation

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its investment with the investee and has the ability to affect those return through its power over the investee.

These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of subsidiaries from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

Profit or loss and each component of the Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the Holding Company and to the Non-Controlling interests (NCI) even if it results in the NCI having a deficit balance.

Material intra-group balances and transactions with subsidiaries are eliminated.

A change in ownership of a subsidiary, without loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction.

Non-controlling interests are that part of the net results of operations and of net assets of subsidiary which are not owned by the Holding Company. Material intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated.

Associates are those entities on which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating polices. Associates as well as investment in mutual funds established under trust structure are accounted for using the equity method.

# 2.3.2 Key financial figures of Islamic Banking branches

are disclosed in Annexure II to the consolidated financial statements.

# 2.5 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective:

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Group's accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2025 but are considered not to be relevant or will not have any material effect on the Group's financial statements except for:

- the new standard - IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (IFRS 18) (published in April 2024) with applicability date of January 01, 2027 by IASB. IFRS 18 is yet to be adopted in Pakistan. IFRS 18 when adopted and applicable shall impact the presentation of 'Statement of Profit and Loss Account' with certain additional disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
- amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' which clarify the date of recognition and derecognition of a financial asset or financial liability including settlement of liabilities through banking instruments and channels including electronic transfers. The amendment when applied may impact the timing of recognition and derecognition of financial liabilities.
- amendment to IAS 21 Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange which will require Banks to apply a consistent approach in assessing whether a currency can be exchanged into another currency and, when it cannot, in determining the exchange rate to use and the disclosures to provide.

The management is in the process of assessing the impact of these amendments on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

# 2.6 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses as well as in the disclosure of contingent liabilities. It also requires management to exercise judgment in application of its accounting policies. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and in future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Material accounting estimates and areas where judgments were made by the management in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

1. classification and credit loss allowance / provisioning against investments (notes 4.6 and 8);
2. classification and credit loss allowance / provisioning against loans and advances (notes 4.7 and 9);
3. income taxes (notes 4.14 and 36);
4. accounting for defined benefit plan and compensated absences (notes 4.11, 40 and 42);
5. depreciation and revaluation of property and equipment and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claim (notes 4.8.2, 4.8.5, 10 and 13.1.1);
6. amortisation of intangibles assets (notes 4.8.3 and 12);
7. impairment of non-financial assets (note 4.15);
8. employee stock option scheme (notes 4.11(d) and 43);
9. fair value measurement of financial instruments (note 44);
10. credit loss allowance / provision against other assets and other provisions (notes 4.17 and 13.4);
11. credit loss allowance / provision against off balance sheet obligations and contingent liabilities (notes 4.16, 4.18, 20.1 and 24); and
12. lease liability including determination of the lease term for lease contracts with renewal and termination options and right-of-use assets (the Group as a lessee) (notes 4.8.4.1, 11 and 17).

# 4.1 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

As per the SBP BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9 is applicable on banks with effect from January 01, 2024. IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of accounting for financial liabilities. To determine appropriate classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments, to be assessed based on combination of the entity's business model for managing the assets and the instruments' contractual cash flows characteristics. The adoption of IFRS 9 has also fundamentally changed the impairment method of financial assets with a forward-looking Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach.

The SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 dated January 22, 2025 (Letters) has made certain amendments and clarified the timelines of some of the SBP's IFRS 9 Application Instructions to address the matters raised by the banks to ensure compliance by the timelines. The Letters have provided clarifications / relaxations on measurement of unquoted equity securities, modification accounting, maintenance of general provisions over and above ECL, accounting methodology for Islamic Banking Institutions and treatment of charity. Accordingly, the Group has adopted the treatment as instructed in the aforementioned Letters in these consolidated financial statements. In addition, the SBP in a separate instruction SBPHOK-BPRD-RPD-BAF-834424 dated January 22, 2025 has allowed extension for application of Effective Interest Rate up to December 31, 2025.

The SBP has directed the Banks through its BPRD Circular Letter No.1 dated January 22, 2025 to continue the existing revenue recognition methodology for Islamic Operations, including the requirements of IFAS 1 and IFAS 2 until further instructions. Had IFRS 9 been adopted in its entirety for revenue recognition from Islamic operations, the profit after tax of the Group would have been lower by Rs. 167.847 million. Further, unappropriated profit of the Group as at December 31, 2024 would have been higher by Rs. 578.741 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 827.739 million).

On application of IFRS 9, certain accounting policies have been revised to comply with the requirements of IFRS 9. The revised accounting policies have been disclosed in their respective policy notes in these consolidated financial statements.

# 4.1.1 Application to the Group's financial assets

Debt based financial assets held by the Group include: advances, lending to financial institutions, investment in federal government securities, corporate bonds and other private sukuks, cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks, and other financial assets.

a) These are measured at amortised cost if these assets meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as fair value through profit and loss (FVPL):

- the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

The business model for these financial assets can still be held to collect (HTC) even when sales of these financial assets occur. However, if more than an infrequent number of sales of significant value are made, the Group assesses whether and how the sales are consistent with the HTC objective.

b) Debt based financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) only if these meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as FVPL:

- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

c) Debt based financial assets if these are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. The application of these policies also resulted in classifications and consequent remeasurements of certain investments in PIBs and Ijarah Sukuk held under available for sale portfolio as of December 31, 2023 to hold to collect based on the business model assessment. The following table reconciles their carrying amounts as reported on December 31, 2023 to the carrying amounts under IFRS 9 on transition to IFRS 9 on January 01, 2024:

|Investment type and category|Balances as of December 31, 2023|Remeasurements|Balances as of January 01, 2024| |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|IFRS 9 Classification|Balances as of December 31, 2023|(Audited)| | |

|Total| |1,175,518,753|7,814,926|1,183,333,679|

Equity based financial assets An equity instrument held by the Group for trading purposes is classified as measured at FVPL. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. The Group has decided to classify Rs. 767.222 million out of its available for sale equity investment (listed shares) portfolio as of December 31, 2023 as FVPL. IFRS 9 has eliminated impairment assessment requirements for investments in equity instruments. Accordingly, the Group has reclassified impairment of Rs. 59.818 million on listed equity investments and Rs. 88.038 million for unlisted equity investment held as at December 31, 2023 to surplus / deficit on revaluation of investments through remeasurements.

The measurement category and carrying amount of financial assets in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan before and after adoption of IFRS 9 as at January 1, 2024 are compared as follows:

|Financial assets|Measurement category|Carrying amount as at December 31, 2023|Measurement category|Carrying amount as at January 01, 2024|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cash and balances with treasury banks|Loans and receivables|202,692,503|Amortised cost|202,692,503|

# 4.2 Financial assets and liabilities

# 4.2.1 Classification

Financial assets

Under IFRS 9, existing categories of financial assets: Held for trading (HFT), Available for sale (AFS), Held to maturity (HTM) and loans and receivables have been replaced by:

- Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss account (FVPL)
- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- Financial assets at amortised cost

Financial liabilities

Under IFRS 9, the accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus financial liabilities are being carried at amortised cost except for derivatives which are being measured at FVPL.

# 4.2.2 Business model assessment

The Group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Group's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether the management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Group's key management personnel;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sale are also important aspects of the assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Group's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress scenarios into account.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:

1. Hold to Collect (HTC) business model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash flows
2. Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S) business model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
3. Other business models: Resulting in classification of financial assets as FVPL

# 4.2.3 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest / profit (SPPI)

As a second step of its classification process, the Group assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether these assets meet the SPPI test. For the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium / discount). The most significant elements of interest / profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Group applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as, but not limited to, the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest / profit rate is set. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at FVPL.

# 4.2.4 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Group purchases or sells the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like advances, lendings to financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the account or financial institutions. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased.

# a) Amortised cost (AC)

Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account. Interest income / profit / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for debt based financial assets in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of debt based financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is transferred from surplus / deficit to unappropriated profit.

# c) Fair value through profit and loss (FVPL)

Financial assets under FVPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost will be directly recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account. Interest / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# 4.2.5 Derecognition

# Financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; The Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its consolidated statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

# Financial liabilities

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# 4.2.6 Modification

The Group sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of financing to its customers. The Group assesses whether the modified terms result in the financial asset being significantly modified and therefore derecognised. When the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified and the renegotiation or modification does not result in the derecognition of that financial asset in accordance with IFRS 9, the Group recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset and shall recognise a modification gain or loss in consolidated statement of profit and loss account. The gross carrying amount of the financial asset is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial original effective interest rate (or credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets). Any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

# 4.3 Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with all advances and other debt financial assets not held at FVPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Group recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money; and
- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

# Definition of default

The concept of "impairment or "default" is critical to the implementation of IFRS 9 as it drives determination of risk parameters, i.e. PD, LGD and EAD.

As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level for corporate / commercial / SME loan portfolios and at segment / product basis for retail portfolio.

This implies that if one facility of a counterparty becomes 90+ DPD in repaying its contractual dues or as defined in PRs; all other facilities would deem to be classified as stage 3.

# 4.8.2 Property and equipments

Property and equipments are shown at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any, except land and buildings which are carried at revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Historical cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Depreciation is charged by applying the straight-line method using the rates specified in note 10.2 to these consolidated financial statements. The depreciation charge for the year is calculated after taking into account residual value, if any. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.

Depreciation on additions is charged from the date on which the assets are available for use and ceases on the date on which these are disposed off.

Maintenance and normal repairs are charged to income as and when incurred. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or are recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that the net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair values.

A revaluation surplus is recorded in other comprehensive income as part of surplus on revaluation of property and equipment in equity. However, to the extent that it reverses a revaluation deficit of the same asset previously recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account, the increase is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account. A revaluation deficit is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account, except to the extent that it offsets an existing surplus on the same asset recognised in the asset revaluation surplus.

A transfer from the asset revaluation surplus to unappropriated profit is made for the difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset and depreciation based on the original cost. Additionally, accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.

An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are taken to the consolidated statement of profit and loss account except that the related surplus / deficit on revaluation of property and equipments (net of deferred taxation) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liability measured at the present value of the consideration (lease payments) to be made over the lease term and is adjusted for lease prepayments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, unless it is not readily determinable, in which case the lessee may use the incremental rate of borrowing. After the commencement date, the carrying amount of lease liability is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.

# Determination of the lease term for lease contracts with renewal and termination options (Group as a lessee)

The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

The Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Group applies judgment in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination.

After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control that affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate.

# 4.9.1 Deposits - Islamic Banking

Deposits are generated on the basis of two modes i.e. Qard and Modaraba. Deposits taken on Qard basis are classified as 'Current Account' and Deposits generated on Modaraba basis are classified as 'Savings Account' and 'Fixed Deposit Accounts'. No profit or loss is passed on to current account depositors. Profits realised in investment pools are distributed in pre-agreed profit sharing ratio. Rab-ul-Maal (Customer) share is distributed among depositors according to weightages assigned at the inception of profit calculation period. Mudarib (The Holding Company) can distribute its share of profit to Rab-ul-Maal upto a specified percentage of its profit. Profits are distributed from the pool so the depositors (remunerative) only bear the risk of assets in the pool during the profit calculation period. Asset pools are created at the Holding Company's discretion and the Holding Company can add, amend, transfer an asset to any other pool in the interests of the deposit holders. In case of loss in a pool during the profit calculation period, the loss is distributed among the depositors (remunerative) according to their ratio of investments.

# 4.14.3 Deferred

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for the taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities using the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available and the credits can be utilised. Deferred tax asset is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realised.

The difference between the carrying value and the recoverable value is recognised through the profit and loss account as a deferred tax expense. The Group also records a deferred tax asset / liability on items recognised directly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income such as surplus / deficit on revaluation of assets. Deferred tax liability is not recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with exchange translation reserves of foreign branches, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

# 4.15 Impairment of non-financial assets

The carrying amount of assets is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable at each reporting date. If any event exists, the recoverable amount of such assets is estimated and impairment losses are recognised immediately in the consolidated financial statements. The resulting impairment loss is taken to the consolidated statement of profit and loss account except for impairment loss on revalued assets, which is adjusted against related revaluation surplus to the extent that the impairment loss does not exceed the surplus on revaluation of that asset.

# 4.20 Derivative financial instruments

Derivatives assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value through profit and loss except for derivatives that are in a designated hedge accounting relationship.

Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when transactions meet the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness, the Bank applies fair value hedge accounting or cash flow hedge accounting as appropriate to the risks being hedged.

The Holding Company has elected to apply hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 Instruments: and for derivatives designated as hedging instruments as allowed under paragraph 7.2.21 of IFRS 9. Subsequent measurement of derivatives designated as hedging instrument depends on whether the hedge is designated as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge as explained below:

## Chunk 1117


# Fair value hedge

Changes in fair value of derivatives (hedge instrument) that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account, together with changes in the fair value of hedged assets (hedged item) that are attributable to hedged risk. The fair value changes of the hedged asset or liability adjust their carrying value and are also recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account except for equity instruments carried at FVOCI where the adjustment is included in other comprehensive income.

If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedge accounting is discontinued. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is immediately recognised in profit and loss.

## Chunk 1118


# Cash flow hedge

For qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially in other comprehensive income and then recycled to the consolidated statement of profit and loss account in the periods when the hedged item will affect the profit and loss. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account immediately.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the hedged item ultimately affects or is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the consolidated statement of profit and loss account.

# Measuring Hedge Effectiveness

For a hedge to qualify for hedge accounting, it must be highly effective, with changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument expected to offset those of the hedged item within a range of Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent it occurs, is recognised in profit or loss. A hedging instrument is a financial instrument used to offset changes in the fair value or cash flows of a designated hedged item, which may be a recognised asset, liability, or an unrecognised firm commitment exposed to specific risks.

# 40.1.14 Funding policy

The Holding Company's policy for funding the staff retirement benefit scheme, is given in note 4.11 (a).

# 40.1.15 Risks associated with defined benefit plans

# Asset volatility

The risk arises due to the inclusion of the risky assets in the gratuity fund portfolio, inflation and interest rate volatility.

# Changes in bond yields

The risk arises when bond yield is lower than the expected return on the plan assets (duration based PIB discount rate).

# Inflation risks

The risk arises if gratuity benefits are linked to inflation and the inflation is higher than expected, which results in higher liabilities.

# Life expectancy / withdrawal risk

The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

# Longevity risks

The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population.

# Salary increase risk

The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the benefit is linked with final salary. The risk arises when the actual increases in salary are higher than expectation and impacts the liability accordingly.

# 44 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as amortised cost / held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted debt securities classified as amortised cost / held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of valuation methodologies. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 44.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 44.3.2 Valuation techniques

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Market Treasury Bills (MTB) / Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIB), and GoP Sukuks (GIS) including their forward contracts|The fair value of MTBs and PIBs are derived using PKRV rates. Floating rate PIBs are revalued using PKFRV rates. The fair value of GoP sukuk listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange has been determined through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange. The fair value of other GIS are revalued using PKISRV rates.|
|Overseas Sukuks, Overseas and GoP Euro Bonds|The fair value of overseas government sukuks, and overseas bonds are determined on the basis of price available on Bloomberg.|
|Debt Securities (TFCs and Sukuk other than Government)|Investment in sukuks, debt securities (comprising term finance certificates, bonds and any other security issued by a company or a body corporate for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.|
|Ordinary shares - listed|The fair value of investments in listed equity securities are valued on the basis of closing quoted market price available at the Pakistan Stock Exchange.|
|Ordinary shares - unlisted|The fair value of investments in certain unlisted equity securities are valued on the basis of dividend discount model.|
|Preference shares - unlisted|The fair value of investment in unlisted preference shares are valued at offer quoted price.|
|Redeemable participating certificates|The fair value of investment in redeemable participating certificates are valued at net asset value.|
|Advances|The fair value of advances are valued on the basis of cashflow discount model.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the FX revaluation rates announced by the SBP.|
|Derivative Instruments|Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques based on market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.|
|Property and equipment and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|The valuation experts used a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank's properties. The market approach used prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical, comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty accordingly a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these consolidated financial statements.|

The following table summarises the quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in level 3 fair value measurements of investment and advances, (The valuation techniques are stated above):

|Description|Fair value as at December 31, 2024|Unobservable inputs*|Discount Rate|Relationship of unobservable inputs to fair value|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Ordinary shares - unlisted|2,333,188|Discount rate|17.2%|Increase / (decrease) in discount rate by 1% with all other variables held constant, would (decrease) / increase the fair value by Rs. 90.457 million and Rs. 97.873 million respectively.|
|Preference shares - unlisted|500,000|Offered quote|Not applicable|Not applicable|
|Redeemable participating certificates|8,315,048|Net asset value|Not applicable|Not applicable|

# 49 RISK MANAGEMENT

The variety of business activities undertaken by the Group require effective identification, measurement, monitoring, integration and management of different financial and non-financial risks that are constantly evolving as business activities change in response to concurrent internal and external developments. The Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) is appointed and authorised by the Board of Directors (BOD) to assist in design, regularly evaluating and timely updating the risk management framework of the Holding Company. The Board has further authorised the management committees i.e. Central Management Committee (CMC), Central Credit Committee (CCC) and Digital Council to supervise risk management activities within their respective scopes. CMC has further established sub-committees such as Assets & Liabilities Committee (ALCO), Investment Committee (IC), Information Technology Steering Committee (ITSC), Control & Compliance Committee (C&CC), Process Improvement Committee (PIC) and Governance Committee for Overseas Operations etc.

The risk management framework endeavours to be a comprehensive and evolving guideline to cater to changing business dynamics. The framework includes:

- Clearly defined risk management policies, procedures, responsibilities and accountabilities;
- Well constituted organisational structure, in the form of separate risk management departments within the Credit and Risk Management Group, which ensure that individuals responsible for risk approval are independent from risk taking units i.e. Business Units;
- Mechanism for ongoing review of policies and procedures and risk exposures.

The primary objective of this architecture is to inculcate risk management into the organisation flows to ensure that risks are accurately identified & assessed, properly documented, approved, and adequately monitored & managed in order to enhance the risk management framework which has a well-defined organisational structure for effective management of credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, information security risk, trade pricing, environment and social risk. Further, there is an advanced focus on optimal utilisation of capital while ensuring compliance with capital requirements. The results of stress tests and internal capital adequacy assessment process and recovery plans are given due consideration in capital and business planning.

# 49.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk is the identification of probability that counterparty will cause a financial loss to the Group due to its inability or unwillingness to meet its contractual obligation. This credit risk arises mainly from lending, hedging, settlement and other financial transactions. The credit risk management processes encompass identification, assessment, measurement, monitoring and control of the Group's exposure to credit risk. The credit risk management philosophy is based on the overall business strategy / direction as established by the Board. The Group is committed to the appropriate level of due diligence to ensure that credit risks have been properly analysed, fully disclosed to the approving authorities and appropriately quantified, also ensuring that the credit commitment is appropriately structured, priced (in line with market practices) and documented.

The Group has built and maintained a sound loan portfolio in terms of well-defined credit policy approved by the Board of Directors (BOD). Its credit evaluation system comprises of well-designed credit appraisal, sanctioning and review procedures for prudence in lending activities and ensuring the high quality of asset portfolio. In order to have an effective and efficient risk assessment, and to closely align its functions with Business, Credit Division has separate units for Corporate banking, Islamic banking, Retail & SME banking (including Agricultural financing) and Overseas Operations & Financial Institutions. For Consumer & Digital products, loans are booked against defined eligibility criteria as per product programs / credit policy and these have a separate credit risk function.

The Group manages its portfolio of loan assets with a view to limit concentrations in terms of risk quality, industry, maturity and large exposure. Portfolio analysis is also conducted on regular basis. This portfolio level oversight is maintained by the Credit & Risk Management Group.

For domestic operations, the Group determines the amount for provisions / expected credit loss as per the IFRS 9 guidelines / Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP and the management best estimates. Provisions at overseas branches are held to meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities of the respective countries in which the overseas branches operates.

A sophisticated internal credit rating system is in place, which is capable of quantifying counter-party and transaction risk in accordance with the best practices. The risk rating system takes into consideration qualitative and quantitative factors of the counter-party, transaction structure & security and generates internal ratings at obligor and facility levels. Furthermore, this system has an integrated loan origination module, which is currently being used in Corporate Banking, Islamic Banking and Retail segments. The system is regularly reviewed for improvements as per the SBP's guidelines for Internal Credit Rating and Risk Management.

The risk rating system incorporates comprehensive obligor risk rating models for the Corporate, Commercial, Small & Medium Enterprises, Agricultural, and Project Finance portfolios. These models are designed using a diverse array of qualitative and quantitative variables, each assigned specific weights or scores. The aggregate score of these variables is mapped to determine the final obligor risk rating. Additionally, the scorecard-based models include a provision for management-level overrides, enabling the incorporation of any critical information or risk factors into the final assessment.

Furthermore, the Holding Company also validates Internal Ratings based on statistical tests for all portfolios. It covers both discrimination and calibration statistical tests as per best practices. The system is backed by secured database with backup support and is capable of generating MIS reports providing snapshot of the entire portfolio for strategizing and decision making. The system is enhanced to compute the ECL calculation for IFRS 9 and risk weighted assets for quarterly credit risk related Basel submissions.

A centralised Credit Administration Division (CAD) under Credit and Risk Management Group is working towards ensuring that terms of approval of credit sanctions and regulatory stipulations are complied with, all documentation including security documentation is regular and fully enforceable and all disbursements of approved facilities are made only after necessary authorisation by CAD.

Credit Policy and Portfolio Management under Credit and Risk Management Group keeps a watch on the quality of the credit portfolio in terms of borrowers' behaviour, identifies weakening accounts relationships and report them to the appropriate authorities with a view to address further deterioration.

To handle the specialised requirements of managing delinquent and problem accounts, the Holding Company has a separate client facing unit to negotiate repayment / settlement of the Holding non-performing exposure and protect the interests of the Holding depositors and stakeholders. The priority of the Special Asset Management Group (SAMG) is recovery of amounts and / or to structure an arrangement (such as rescheduling, restructuring, settlement or a combination of these) by which the interests of the Group are protected. Where no other recourse is possible, SAMG may proceed with legal recourse so as to maximise the recovery of the Holding assets. The Credit and Risk Management Group also monitors the NPL portfolio of the Holding Company and reports the same to CCC / BRMC.

# 49.1.1 Credit risk - general disclosures Basel specific

The Group is using Standardised Approach (SA) of the SBP's Basel accord for the purpose of estimating credit risk weighted assets. Under SA, banks are allowed to take into consideration external rating(s) of counter-parties for the purpose of calculating risk weighted assets. A detailed procedural manual specifying processes for deriving Credit Risk Weighted Assets in accordance with the SBP Basel Standardised Approach is in place and firmly adhered to by the Group.

The SBP Basel III guidelines require banks to use ratings assigned by specified External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) namely Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA), VIS and Moody's, Fitch and Standard & Poor's.

The SBP through its letter number BSD/BAI-2/201/1200/2009 dated December 21, 2009 accorded approval to the Holding Company for use of ratings assigned by Credit Rating Agency of Bangladesh (CRAB) and Credit Rating Information and Services Limited (CRISL). The Holding Company uses these ECAIs to rate its exposures denominated in Bangladeshi currency on certain corporate exposures and banks incorporated in Bangladesh.

# 49.1.3.2 Collateral valuation and management

As stipulated in the SBP Basel guidelines, the Group uses the comprehensive approach for collateral valuation. Under this approach, the Group reduces its credit exposure to a counterparty when calculating its capital requirements to the extent of risk mitigation provided by the eligible financial collateral as specified in the Basel guidelines. In line with Basel guidelines, the Group makes adjustments in eligible collaterals for possible future fluctuations in the value of the collateral. These adjustments, also referred to as to produce volatility adjusted amounts for collateral, are reduced from the exposure to compute the capital charge based on the applicable risk weights.

# 49.1.3.3 Types of collaterals

The Group determines the appropriate collateral for each facility based on the type of product and counterparty. In case of corporate and SME financing, fixed assets are generally taken as security for long tenure loans and current assets for working capital finance usually backed by mortgage or hypothecation. For project finance, security of the assets of the borrowers and assignment of the underlying project contracts are generally obtained. Additional security such as pledge of shares, cash collateral, TDRs, SSC/DSCs, charge on receivables may also be obtained. Moreover, in order to cover the entire exposure personal guarantees of directors / borrowers are also obtained generally by the Group. For retail products, the security to be taken is defined in the product policy for the respective products. Housing loans and automobile loans are secured by the property and automobile being financed respectively. The Group also offers products which are primarily based on collateral such as shares, specified securities and pledged commodities. These products are offered in line with the SBP prudential regulations and approved product policies which also deal with types of collateral, valuation and margining. The decision on the type and quantum of collateral for each transaction is taken by the credit approving authority as per the credit approval authorisation approved by the CCC under its delegation powers. For facilities provided as per approved product policies (retail products, loan against shares etc.), collateral is taken in line with the policy.

# 49.1.3.5 Credit concentration risk

Credit concentration risk arises mainly due to concentration of exposures under various categories viz. industry, geography, and single/group borrower exposures. Within credit portfolio, as a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of risks, the SBP has prescribed regulatory limits on maximum exposure to single borrower, group borrowers and related parties. Moreover, in order to restrict the industry concentration risk, the Holding annual credit plan spells out the maximum allowable exposure that it can take on specific industry. Additionally, the Internal Rating System allows the Holding Company to monitor risk rating concentration of borrowers against different grades / scores ranging from 1 - 12 (1 being the best and 12 being loss category).

Particulars of the Group's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet credit risk in various sectors are analysed as follows:

# 49.1.3.6 Methodologies and models used for the measurement of Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD).

The Holding Company has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Holding Company considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal / external rating grade for subject customer. The Holding Company also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer / facility to the watch list, or the account being restructured. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Holding Company considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 60 days past due. When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Holding Company applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its financial instruments into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

## Chunk 1272


# Stage 1 (Performing assets):

When financial instruments are first recognised, the Holding Company recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Holding Company calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-months default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the forward looking LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

# Stage 2 (Underperforming assets):

When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Holding Company records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

# Stage 3 (Non performing assets):

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Holding Company recognises LTECLs for these instruments. A description of how the Bank defines credit-impaired and default is given in relevant section. The Holding Company uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP.

# Undrawn financing commitments:

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the Holding Company estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the financings are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. For revolving facilities that include both financings and an undrawn commitment, ECLs are calculated on un-drawn portion (after application of CCF) of the facility and presented within other liabilities.

# Forward looking information:

The Holding Company has performed historical analysis and identified the key economic variables impacting credit risk and expected credit losses for Wholesale & Retail portfolio. These economic variables and their associated impact on the PD vary by the portfolio. The rating band / DPD bucket wise PDs are computed through migration analysis using at least 5 years historical transition matrices of respective portfolio. Furthermore, a detailed regression analysis is carried out using Macro Economic variables (i.e. Average Inflation rate and GDP Growth rate were regressed against Bank's Internal Default Rates) in order to attain forward-looking PDs for each following year.

584 | ANNUAL REPORT 2024

In addition to the base economic scenario, the Holding Company also uses other possible scenarios along with scenario weightings. The number of scenarios and their attributes are reassessed at each reporting date. The scenario weightings are determined by a combination of statistical analysis and expert credit judgment, taking account of the range of possible outcomes each chosen scenario is representative of.

For expected credit loss provisions modelled on a collective basis, a grouping of exposures is performed on the basis of shared risk characteristics, such that risk exposures within a group are homogeneous.

In its ECL models, the Holding Company relies on range of the following forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

# The Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is measured on either a 12-month (12M) or Lifetime basis depending on whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred since initial recognition or whether an asset is considered to be credit-impaired. Expected credit losses are the discounted product of the Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD), discounted at an approximation to the EIR, defined as follows:

# Probability of Default (PD)

The Probability of default (PD) represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation, either over the next 12 months (12M PD), or over the remaining lifetime (Lifetime PD) of the obligation.

- For corporate, commercial, SME and agriculture loan portfolios (collectively referred to as the Holding Company has used a obligor risk rating (ORR) transition based approach to determine the segment wise PDs for each ORR.
- For auto loans, housing, personal installment loans and credit cards (collectively referred to as the a days-past-due based migration approach has been used; and these PD's for wholesale & retail portfolio are then adjusted with forward looking information to arrive at point in time (PIT) PDs;
- For other financial assets (i.e. investments, lending to financial institutions, balances with other banks etc.), historical PDs were estimated on the basis of global default Rates taken from s&P rating-wise transition matrices. These annual default Rates were converted into forward-looking PDs using the vasicek model. the forecast global macro-economic variables were derived using historical regression between global macro-economic variables and Pakistan macro-economic variables.

# Exposure at Default (EAD)

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Holding Company has a legal right to call it earlier. The Holding product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail facilities, in which the Holding Company has the right to cancel and / or reduce the facilities with one day notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Holding Company does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the Holding expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the Holding future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

# Loss Given Default (LGD)

LGD represents an estimate of the loss incurred on a facility in the event of default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Holding Company expects to receive. It is expressed as a percentage of the EAD. Holding Company has estimated segment wise LGDs for Corporate/Commercial, SE, ME & Agri Portfolio as well as product wise LGDs for Auto Finance, Personal Loan, Home Finance and Credit Card portfolio. The LGDs are determined using workout approach, based on vintage recovery data for the defaulted portfolio; these recoveries are then discounted back to date of default, to factor in time value of money.

The Holding Company has converted the estimates for segment / product wise historical LGDs (Through the cycle LGDs) into forward looking point in time LGDs, through use of term structure of Point in time PDs.

# 49.1.3.7 ECL Principles, Grouping and Calculations

The ECL is determined by projecting the PD, LGD and EAD for each future repayment date and for each individual exposure. These three components are multiplied together, effectively calculating an ECL for each future repayment date, which is then discounted back to the reporting date and summed.

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective interest rate (at reporting date), the Holding Company uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date).

When estimating the ECLs, the Holding Company considers three scenarios (a base, best and a worst case). Each of these scenario's is based on different macro-economic forecasts and is associated with different set of PDs & LGD.

Furthermore, to mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Holding Company seeks to use collateral, where possible. The Bank considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics:

- History of legal certainty & enforceability
- History of recovery

The Holding Company's management has only considered cash, liquid securities, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals, while calculating EADs. Furthermore, The credit exposure (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

# Impact on Regulatory Capital:

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the Group, which has reduced their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has permitted Banks to opt for transitional arrangement for the ECL impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the 'Application Instructions' issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement.

Accordingly, Holding Company has opted for transition arrangement to phase in ECL impact and below tabulated is the impact on key ratios, had the transitional arrangement not applied.

|Key Ratios|With Transitional arrangement|Without Transitional arrangement|

# 49.1.3.8 ECL Modeling and staging criteria/ Significant increase in ECLs

Significant increase in credit risk (SICR): A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument compared to the risk of default expected at the time of initial recognition. The Holding Company uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR including, inter alia, the deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR), in line with Holding Company's internally approved grid outlining specific notches downgrade for each ORR / external rating, payments being past due by 60 days, and other qualitative factors (such as watchlisting or restructuring of account).

# 49.1.4 Loans and advances definitions and methodologies of categorisation, credit loss allowance stages and movements between stages

Backward Transition: In line with Holding Company's IFRS 9 Policy and Regulatory guidelines, financial assets shall be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they fulfill the criteria outlined in the Prudential Regulations (PR) issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Similarly, financial assets classified under Stage 2 shall be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) no longer exist. However, a minimum period of three months from the initial downgrade is mandatory before any facility can be moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2.

For a facility to transition from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it must meet the declassification requirements specified in the relevant Prudential Regulations. An exposure cannot be directly upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1; instead, it must first transition to Stage 2 and subsequently complete a cooling-off period of three months before being reclassified to Stage 1.

# 49.2      Market Risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to movements in market prices. It results from changes in interest rates, exchange rates and equity prices as well as from changes in the correlations between them. To manage and control market risk, a comprehensive Board approved Market & Liquidity Risk Management Policy, is in place. The policy outlines a well-defined risk control structure, responsibilities of relevant stakeholders with respect to market risk management and methods to measure and control market risk at a portfolio level. These controls include limits on exposure to individual market risk variables as well as limits on concentrations of tenors. This structure is reviewed, adjusted and approved periodically.

Under the BoD approved policy, the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) and Investment Committee (IC) are primarily responsible for the oversight of market risk, supported by Market & Liquidity Risk Department of Risk Management Division (RMD). Furthermore, the Group carries out risk assessment via diversified tools including Value at Risk (VaR), PVBP (Price Value per Basis Point) and Duration on a regular basis. The Group also ascertains the impact of market risk on relevant portfolios through stress testing and the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment processes.

# 49.3      Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange (FX) risk arises from fluctuation in the value of financial instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group manages FX risk by setting and monitoring through approved currency wise net open position limits and Foreign Exchange Exposure Limit (FEEL). Foreign exchange risk is controlled and monitored through limits approved by ALCO, within the overall FEEL limit advised by the SBP.

# Equity Position Risk

Equity position risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in the prices of individual stocks or market indices. The equity investments are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) / available for sale (AFS) and fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) / held for trading (HFT) investments. The objective of classifying investments as FVPL / HFT is to take advantage of short term capital gains, while the FVOCI / AFS portfolio is maintained with a medium term view of capital gains and dividend income. The Investment Committee is primarily responsible for the oversight of the equity investment risk. The Group has an active and regular monitoring mechanism for utilisation against approved portfolio limits, scrip wise limits, sector limits, loss triggers and timely escalation of Management Action Trigger Levels (MAT).

# Yield / Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)-Basel II Specific

Interest Rate Risk is the adverse impact on the Group's shareholder's equity due to changes in the interest rates. It may be further elaborated as changes in the present value of the asset, liabilities and commitments due to changes in interest rates, including changes in the shape of yield curves. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of mismatches in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet interest sensitive instruments within a certain range of maturity or re-pricing (whichever is earlier). The Group has formulated a separate Interest Rate Risk Management (IRRM) framework which establishes aggregate and tenor-wise balance sheet level PVBP (Price Value per basis points) limits to manage interest rate risk within the Board approved risk appetite. Treasury and Capital Markets Group is primarily responsible for management of interest rate risk on a daily basis, and the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) oversees the interest rate risk at Group level. Market Risk Department of Risk Management Division independently monitors, analyses and reports various limits including management action point limits and re-pricing of the assets and liabilities on a regular basis.

# 49.5.1 Operational Risk Disclosures - Basel Specific

The Holding Company is among the first few banks in the industry to secure the SBP approval for adoption of Alternative Standardized Approach (ASA) under Basel guidelines for determining capital charge on operational risk in December 2013. The Holding Company started calculating its capital charge for operational risk using ASA from December 31, 2013.

The SBP approval stipulated a capital floor i.e. operational risk charge under ASA should not fall below as a certain percentage of operational risk capital charge calculated under Basic Indicator Approach for initial three years. These floors were 90% for 2013 and 2014, 80% for 2015 and 70% for 2016. However, removal of capital floor for calculation of capital charge under ASA was extended in line with international developments and consultations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).

Embedding a sustainable risk culture remains our core objective, which includes effective management of operational issues and emerging risks across the Group and in our overseas operations via deployment of required resources, tools and continuous supervision. The new Operational Risk Framework, Policy and Standards, duly approved by the Board, have been rolled out along with new system platforms (Operational Risk System) for recording and tracking of risk events, including non-financial risks. The Group is implementing a new process and risk based Risk & Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) mechanism to ensure effective assessment of controls and to manage operational risks within the organization. The Group has also deployed the First Line Operational Risk teams to perform controls self-assessments and reviews, especially for the processes and activities, that may significantly impact the risk appetite. Furthermore, new and amended products, systems, activities and processes are subject to comprehensive operational risk assessments before implementation and launch.

# 49.5.2 Information Security Risk

Cyber risk is now amongst the top ranked risks that all organizations face and the Holding Company is cognizant of its significance and possible impacts. The Holding Board IT Committee (BITC) and management level IT Steering Committee (ITSC) provide oversight of cyber security matters. The Holding Company has in place a well-defined Information Security Risk Management Policy / Framework, duly approved by the Board of Directors. The framework is supplemented with comprehensive Information Security Risk Management procedures approved by the executive management.

# 49.5.3 Environmental Risk Unit

The Holding Company has integrated sustainable finance approach in its lending activities. In this regard, Green Banking Policy and Environmental & Social Management System (ESMS) have been put in place.

The ESMS Framework essentially requires that any relevant lending opportunity is to be reviewed and evaluated under:

- International Finance Corporation exclusion list;
- Applicable national laws on environment, health, safety and social issues; and
- International Finance Corporation performance standards.

This framework is an integral part of the credit approval process. All relevant credit proposals require Environmental & Social review prior to approval of the competent authority.

During 2022, the SBP has issued Environmental & Social Risk Management (ESRM) Implementation Manual, based on IFC performance standards, which is applicable to all banks in Pakistan. From November 20, 2023, the Holding Company has implemented the afore-mentioned SBP manual in letter and spirit.

# 49.5.4 Country risk

Country risk refers to the possibility that economic and political conditions in a foreign country could adversely impact the exposure in that country. For the Group, country risk arises as a result of the net investment in foreign operations, foreign currency lending, trade and treasury business with counterparties domiciled in other countries as well as investments and capital transactions. In order to manage the risk, Group has in place a comprehensive country risk management framework. Under this framework, the transfer risk is measured using financial market and economic factors. Political risk is measured using a variety of indicia indicative of willingness to honour its foreign obligations. Based on this framework, risk limits are assigned to countries within the Board approved limits. The limits and their utilisation are monitored and managed at head office level and country risk exposures are reported to the relevant committees at a defined frequency.

# 49.6 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity is a financial capacity to meet its obligations as they fall due without incurring losses. Liquidity risk is the risk to an earnings, capital and reputation arising from its inability (real or perceived) to meet its contractual obligations in a timely manner without incurring unacceptable losses when they come due.

With reference to the SBP Basel III Liquidity Standards issued under BPRD circular # 08 dated June 23, 2016, the Group calculates Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) on a monthly basis. Based on the financial statements as at December 31, 2024, the LCR is 1.35 or 135% against the SBP minimum requirement of 100%, with Total Stock of High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) of Rs. 1,002,124.577 million and Net Cash Outflows of Rs. 741,767.855 million.

Moreover, under the same circular the Banks are expected to calculate Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) on quarterly basis. Based on December 31, 2024 numbers the NSFR is 1.26 or 126% against SBP minimum requirement of 100%, with Total Available Stable Funding of Rs. 1,690,754.449 million and Total Required Stable Funding of Rs. 1,340,991.900 million.

The Group manages and controls liquidity risk through a detailed risk management framework, which includes BoD approved policy, the management level procedural document and Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) level guidelines. Under this framework, various liquidity metrics are implemented and monitored on a regular basis.

The Board approves the Holding overall liquidity risk appetite and broad liquidity risk strategy through Annual Business Plan. The ALCO is primarily responsible for the implementation of Board's strategy through oversight of the first line of defence against liquidity risk. Under Risk Management Division, Liquidity Risk Management Department is responsible for independent monitoring of the overall liquidity risk in line with regulatory requirements and own risk appetite.

The overall funding strategy is based on the principles of diversification and stability. The Group has a diverse funding base, which includes stable funding in the form of equity, sub-ordinated loans, retail and small business deposits and non-stable funding in form of large volume depositors. The Group has in place internally approved limits to monitor and manage risk emanating from volatile funding concentration. Moreover, the Group is fully compliant with Basel III LCR and NSFR, which ensure sufficient stock of high quality liquidity assets in relation to its liability profile.

Stress testing is used in an attempt to highlight the vulnerability of the statement of financial position to hypothetical stress events and scenarios. Based on the scenarios, liquidity risk factors are given major shocks and their resulting impact on the statement of financial position is calculated. The Group carries out the stress testing based on SBP stress tests and internal defined scenarios to gauge the potential impacts of different liquidity stress scenarios and share the results with the senior management, the BoD and the regulator.

At the Group, Contingency Funding Plan (CFP), are in place for all jurisdictions to address liquidity issues in times of stress / crises situations. The Treasury division prepares the CFPs for all operations on annual basis for identifying the stress scenarios and the funding plan for such scenarios along with early warning indicators. These plans are reviewed by the Risk Management Division and are approved by the ALCO annually.

Main drivers of LCR results are High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) and Net Cash Outflow. HQLA is defined by the liquidity quality of the assets and net cash outflow is mainly determined through volatility of the liability profile.

|HQLA*|Market Value|Weighted Amount|
|---|---|---|
|Level 1 Assets|990,177,457|990,177,457|
|Level 2A Assets|3,174,211|2,698,080|
|Level 2B Assets|17,572,037|9,249,041|
|Total|Total|1,010,923,705|
| | |1,002,124,578|

* These have been defined in detail in the SBP Circular No. 08, dated June 23, 2016.

# 50 AFGHANISTAN OPERATIONS

Bank Alfalah maintains a two-branch presence in Afghanistan. The Board and the management of the Holding Company continue to closely monitor the evolving situation in Afghanistan which has been hampered due to the country's frozen reserves and uncertainty regarding international recognition which prevent normal flows in and out of Afghanistan. The Holding Company has taken impairment against net assets where there is an indication that carrying amount may be higher than its recoverable amount. The Holding Company remains focused on maintaining its control standards i.e. both onshore and through Head Office oversight.
