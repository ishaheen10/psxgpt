# Macroeconomic Review

Pakistan experienced a broad-based economic recovery in FY’24, with growth and confidence exhibiting a nascent turnaround. Following a contraction in FY’23, GDP is forecasted to grow by around 2% in FY’24. The industrial sector remains subdued with suppressed demand as a result of high interest rates and energy prices; the Large-Scale Manufacturing Index declined by 0.5% during 8MFY’24 compared to the same period last year. Headline inflation has moderated to a 22-month low of 20.7% in Mar’24 from peak levels of 38.0% in May’23 on the back of a stable currency, easing global commodity prices and a high base effect. This led to real interest rates turning positive for the first time since Jan’21. Average inflation for 9MFY’24 was 27.2%, the same level as for 9MFY’23. The SBP has revised its average CPI forecast for FY’24 from 20-22% to 23-25%.

For 8MFY’24, weak demand and easing international commodity prices manifested a 9% contraction in the import bill. Meanwhile exports increased by 10% during the same period, mainly led by food exports. Hence, the overall trade deficit narrowed to USD 13.5 billion, 28% lower than in 8MFY’23. In Q1FY’24, remittances had declined by 20%. The subsequent crackdown on illegal activity and new reforms for exchange companies has fully offset this; remittances for 9MFY’24 showed an increase of 0.9%, with March 2024 posting a 23-month high of nearly $3 billion. The reduction in the trade deficit, along with stable remittance flows, drove a significant decline in the current account deficit, which reduced by 74% YoY, to USD 1.0 billion in 8MFY’24.

Foreign exchange reserves of $8 billion remain stable. Pakistan successfully repaid its $ 1 billion Eurobond at maturity on April 12, 2024. Fitch and Moody’s maintained Pakistan’s credit rating with a Stable Outlook recognizing stabilization efforts and good performance on the Standby Arrangement (SBA). The second and final review of the SBA was successfully completed with a Staff Level Agreement reached. The newly elected government remains committed to reform efforts, particularly on energy, taxation and privatization of state-owned enterprises and is actively working with the IMF on a successor medium-term program. Improved external buffers and market confidence has led to an appreciation of the Rupee which gained ~1.3% during 2024, currently trading at Rs 278/$.

The bull run in the equity market, which commenced in Q4’23 has extended into 2024, with the KSE100 Index up 13% as of April 15, 2024 and continuing to break new records, crossing 70,000. Market sentiments remained strong, backed by the formation of a new government, clarity on acceleration of economic reforms under the new Finance Minister and the successful final review under the SBA.

The SBP continued with a status quo approach to the policy rate, keeping it unchanged at its March 2024 meeting. The MPC noted that although inflation had reduced considerably, the absolute level remained high along with upside risks still present. It highlighted that inflation expectations of consumers and businesses remain elevated, emanating from upward adjustments in energy prices and implementation of IMF warranted fiscal measures. Therefore, in order to tame inflation to its target range of 5-7% by Sep’25 a continued tight monetary stance was warranted. In 2024, a 1.6% decline in private sector credit from Dec’23 levels has resulted in a 3.1% fall in banking sector advances as of Mar’24. Industry deposits increased by 1.7% in Q1’24.

# Financial Performance

HBL’s consolidated profit before tax of Rs 30.1 billion for Q1’24 has increased by 40% over the same period last year. The performance was underpinned by excellent results in both the domestic and the international businesses. The Bank’s profit after tax rose to Rs 15.0 billion, increasing 13% over Q1’23. Earnings per share improved from Rs 9.00 in Q1’23 to Rs 10.37 in Q1’24.

The Bank’s balance sheet stood at Rs 5.5 trillion with total deposits growing by Rs 234 billion over Dec’23 to Rs 4.4 trillion. Domestic deposits increased to Rs 3.7 trillion, primarily led by a growth of Rs 115 billion in low-cost deposits. Credit demand has remained muted in the tight monetary policy environment, with domestic advances reducing to Rs 1.3 trillion; total advances of the Bank as at March 31, 2024 were Rs 1.7 trillion. Nevertheless, the Bank’s market-leading consumer portfolio remained on a growth trajectory, increasing to Rs 130.0 billion.
---
The average domestic balance sheet grew by Rs 522 billion to Rs 4.1 trillion; the impact was somewhat diluted by lower margins as market rates have come off their peak, leading to a 6% growth in net interest income over the first quarter of 2023. Strong performance from the international business, supported by wider margins, returned a growth of 27%, bringing the Bank’s total net interest income for Q1’24 to Rs 60.5 billion, an increase of 8% over Q1’23. Non-fund income increased to Rs 20.2 billion in Q1’24, driven by HBL’s superior fee business which delivered excellent results, growing 27% to Rs 11.9 billion. While the flagship Cards franchise continued to lead the fee growth, the trade and branch banking businesses also posted stellar double-digit increases. HBL’s total revenue thus rose by 25%, to Rs 80.7 billion.

Continued high inflation has increased administrative expenses by 18% to Rs 46.2 billion; however, consistent revenue growth has improved the cost to income ratio from 60.8% in Q1’23 to 57.2% in Q1’24. A slowdown in loan growth and higher non-performing loans have induced an uptick in the infection ratio to 5.6%; total coverage remains above 100%.

# Dividend

The Board of Directors, in its meeting held on April 23, 2024, has declared an interim cash dividend of Rs 4.0 per share (40%) for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

# Future Outlook

Looking ahead, elevated domestic and external financing needs will limit the ability of the government to promote a growth-oriented policy, while the private sector is already facing headwinds from lower domestic demand and rising cost pressures. As a result, we expect growth to remain sluggish for FY’24. Utility prices are on an upswing due to the need to reduce circular debt in the energy chain. While this will provide some upward impetus to inflation, we believe it will be more than offset by the impact of the base effect carry over from last year. While inflation is decelerating and is anticipated to ease off further from Q2’24 onwards, upside risks from geopolitical factors remain.

# To overcome Pakistan’s macroeconomic imbalances

The focus needs to be on improving governance and successful implementation of necessary reforms. Tax collection has improved over the years, but it is entirely due to over-taxing the already taxed. The government actively needs to introduce new taxation reforms, improve efficiency and broaden the tax base by introducing technology and simplifying the process. Financial support to loss making and inefficient SOEs are a major drag on the fiscal resources of the country and improving governance towards their eventual privatization should be a critical priority. Finally, the importance of graduating from the SBA to a larger and longer Extended Fund Facility cannot be overemphasized as this will provide both the fiscal space as well as the external stability for the Government to carry out much-needed structural reforms.

# HBL has demonstrated resilience

HBL has demonstrated resilience in a challenging environment, with the strong results a testament to the loyalty of our customers. HBL’s digital footprint and presence continues to grow exponentially, from Konnect to cash management to Treasury solutions. Over 4 million users of HBL Mobile and Internet Banking transacted over Rs 1.6 trillion in just the first quarter of 2024. Over the last few years, the Bank has played a pivotal role in strengthening Pakistan’s agriculture sector through its unique interventions which have doubled farmer incomes. In Q1’24 HBL formally launched HBL Zarai Services in Burewala, which will provide agriculture extension services to empower farmers and enhance productivity throughout the entire value chain. This is another landmark initiative by HBL and will Insha Allah transform the agriculture landscape of the country.

# 3.1.1

Classification of Financial Assets

The Group classifies its financial assets, other than its investments in subsidiaries and associates, into the following categories:

- at Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)
- at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)
- at Amortised Cost

## Chunk 31


# Classification of Equity instruments

Equity securities that are traded in an active market and are held for trading purposes will be classified as FVTPL. Equity securities that are not held for trading purposes will be classified as FVOCI; however, gains and losses on disposal of securities classified as FVOCI will not be recycled through the profit and loss account. The classification decision is made on a case by case basis at the time of purchase, is documented, and is irrevocable.

## Chunk 32


# Classification of other Financial Assets

Financial Assets other than equity will be classified based on their cash flow characteristics and business model assessment:

- Amortised Cost: These will be classified as amortised cost if the objective is to hold the asset only for collecting contractual cash flows (principal and interest).
- FVOCI: These will be classified at FVOCI when the objective is to collect contractual cash flows (principal and interest) and also to potentially sell the same depending on market conditions. Any unrealized profit or loss on debt instruments classified as FVOCI is reflected in other comprehensive income and is recycled through the profit and loss account when the investment is sold.
- FVTPL: This includes financial assets:
- a. which are not classified as either at amortised cost or FVOCI
- b. which do not have a fixed maturity

In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

# Subsequent Measurement

# Equity and debt securities classified as FVTPL

These securities are subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these securities are taken through the profit and loss account.

## Chunk 34


# Equity and debt securities classified as FVOCI

These securities are subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in OCI. When a debt security is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to the profit and loss account. When an equity security is derecognised, gains and losses previously recognised in OCI are not recycled through the profit and loss account but are transferred directly to retained earnings.

# Other financial assets classified at amortised cost

Other financial assets initially classified at amortised cost continue to be subsequently measured at amortised cost.

# 3.1.2 Classification of Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified at FVTPL, when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value.

Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method.

# 3.1.3 Impairment

An ECL provision will be calculated on financial assets designated at FVOCI or at Amortised cost in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9 and the guidelines issued by the SBP. Credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework.

Equity securities are not subject to impairment.

# 3.1.4 Transitional Impact

The Bank has elected to follow the modified retrospective approach for restatement i.e. comparative figures have not been restated on the initial application of IFRS 9. Instead, the cumulative impact has been recorded as an adjustment to equity as of January 01, 2024. Accordingly, the information presented as of December 31, 2023 and for the period ended March 31, 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9.

# 3.2 Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance and fair valuation of unlisted equity securities

The measurement of the ECL allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and at FVOCI is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behavior. A number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such

- Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL;
- Establishing groups of similar financial assets for the purpose of measuring ECL;
- Establishing the number and relative weightages of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios for each segment and the associated ECL; and
- Determining whether an asset shows a significant increase in credit risk.

# 3.3 Fair valuation of unlisted equity securities

The measurement of the fair value of investments in unquoted equity securities involves the use of different methodologies and assumptions. The Group uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation techniques incorporate all the factors that market participants would consider in pricing a transaction.

When observable inputs are not readily available, the fair value is determined using valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models.

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

# FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024

For the three months ended March 31, 2024

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements are categorised within the following fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:

- Level 1 - Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 - Fair value measurements using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the assets or liabilities either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 - Fair value measurements using inputs that are not based on observable market data.

Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within Level 2 and Level 3:

- Federal Government securities: The fair values of Federal Government securities are determined on the basis of rates / prices sourced from Reuters.
- Non-Government debt securities: Non-Government debt securities denominated in Rupees are valued on the basis of rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP). Non-Government debt securities denominated in other currencies are valued on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg / Reuters.
- Foreign Government debt securities: The fair values of foreign Government debt securities are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg/ Reuters.
- Unquoted equity securities: The fair values of unquoted equity investments are estimated using the adjusted break-up value of the investee company. These are further discounted for marketability concerns. Where the agreed / indicative prices are available the Bank uses the same as an estimate for fair value.
- Units of mutual funds: The fair values of units of mutual funds are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of each business day.
- Derivatives: The Group enters into derivatives contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques based on market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.
- Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions: The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.
- Property and equipment and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims: Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity, required for Level 3 assets, has not been presented in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

# Macroeconomic Review

Pakistan experienced a broad-based economic recovery in FY’24, with growth and confidence exhibiting a nascent turnaround. Following a contraction in FY’23, GDP is forecasted to grow by around 2% in FY’24. The industrial sector remains subdued with suppressed demand as a result of high interest rates and energy prices; the Large-Scale Manufacturing Index declined by 0.5% during 8MFY’24 compared to the same period last year. Headline inflation has moderated to a 22-month low of 20.7% in Mar’24 from peak levels of 38.0% in May’23 on the back of a stable currency, easing global commodity prices and a high base effect. This led to real interest rates turning positive for the first time since Jan’21. Average inflation for 9MFY’24 was 27.2%, the same level as for 9MFY’23. The SBP has revised its average CPI forecast for FY’24 from 20-22% to 23-25%.

For 8MFY’24, weak demand and easing international commodity prices manifested a 9% contraction in the import bill. Meanwhile exports increased by 10% during the same period, mainly led by food exports. Hence, the overall trade deficit narrowed to USD 13.5 billion, 28% lower than in 8MFY’23. In Q1FY’24, remittances had declined by 20%. The subsequent crackdown on illegal activity and new reforms for exchange companies has fully offset this; remittances for 9MFY’24 showed an increase of 0.9%, with March 2024 posting a 23-month high of nearly $3 billion. The reduction in the trade deficit, along with stable remittance flows, drove a significant decline in the current account deficit, which reduced by 74% YoY, to USD 1.0 billion in 8MFY’24.

Foreign exchange reserves of $8 billion remain stable. Pakistan successfully repaid its $ 1 billion Eurobond at maturity on April 12, 2024. Fitch and Moody’s maintained Pakistan’s credit rating with a Stable Outlook recognizing stabilization efforts and good performance on the Standby Arrangement (SBA). The second and final review of the SBA was successfully completed with a Staff Level Agreement reached. The newly elected government remains committed to reform efforts, particularly on energy, taxation and privatization of state-owned enterprises and is actively working with the IMF on a successor medium-term program. Improved external buffers and market confidence has led to an appreciation of the Rupee which gained ~1.3% during 2024, currently trading at Rs 278/$.

The bull run in the equity market, which commenced in Q4’23 has extended into 2024, with the KSE100 Index up 13% as of April 15, 2024 and continuing to break new records, crossing 70,000. Market sentiments remained strong, backed by the formation of a new government, clarity on acceleration of economic reforms under the new Finance Minister and the successful final review under the SBA.

The SBP continued with a status quo approach to the policy rate, keeping it unchanged at its March 2024 meeting. The MPC noted that although inflation had reduced considerably, the absolute level remained high along with upside risks still present. It highlighted that inflation expectations of consumers and businesses remain elevated, emanating from upward adjustments in energy prices and implementation of IMF warranted fiscal measures. Therefore, in order to tame inflation to its target range of 5-7% by Sep’25 a continued tight monetary stance was warranted. In 2024, a 1.6% decline in private sector credit from Dec’23 levels has resulted in a 3.1% fall in banking sector advances as of Mar’24. Industry deposits increased by 1.7% in Q1’24.

# Financial Performance

HBL’s Unconsolidated profit before tax of Rs 29.7 billion for Q1’24 has increased by 13% over the same period last year. The performance was underpinned by excellent results in both the domestic and the international businesses. Earnings per share declined slightly from Rs 10.4 in Q1’23 to Rs 10.0 in Q1’24 due to a higher applicable tax rate.

The Bank’s balance sheet stood over Rs 5.1 trillion with total deposits growing by Rs 234 billion over Dec’23 to Rs 4.1 trillion. Domestic deposits increased to Rs 3.7 trillion, primarily led by a growth of Rs 115 billion in low-cost deposits. Credit demand has remained muted in the tight monetary policy environment, with domestic advances reducing to Rs 1.3 trillion; total advances of the Bank as at March 31, 2024 were Rs 1.6 trillion. Nevertheless, the Bank’s market-leading consumer portfolio remained on a growth trajectory, increasing to Rs 130.0 billion.

# HBL Quarterly Report | March 2024

The average domestic balance sheet grew by Rs 522 billion to Rs 4.1 trillion; the impact was somewhat diluted by lower margins as market rates have come off their peak, leading to a 6% growth in net interest income over the first quarter of 2023. Strong performance from the international business, supported by wider margins, returned a growth of 26%, bringing the Bank’s total net interest income for Q1’24 to Rs 55.9 billion, an increase of 8% over Q1’23. Non-fund income increased to Rs 18.2 billion in Q1’24, driven by HBL’s superior fee business which delivered excellent results, growing 28% to Rs 10.5 billion. While the flagship Cards franchise continued to lead the fee growth, the trade and branch banking businesses also posted stellar double-digit increases. HBL’s total revenue thus rose by 16%, to Rs 74.0 billion.

Continued high inflation has increased administrative expenses by 18% to Rs 41.6 billion; cost to income ratio thus increased from 55.2% in Q1’23 to 56.1% in Q1’24. A slowdown in loan growth and higher non-performing loans have induced an uptick in the infection ratio to 5.7%; total coverage remains above 100%.

# Future Outlook

Looking ahead, elevated domestic and external financing needs will limit the ability of the government to promote a growth-oriented policy, while the private sector is already facing headwinds from lower domestic demand and rising cost pressures. As a result, we expect growth to remain sluggish for FY’24. Utility prices are on an upswing due to the need to reduce circular debt in the energy chain. While this will provide some upward impetus to inflation, we believe it will be more than offset by the impact of the base effect carry over from last year. While inflation is decelerating and is anticipated to ease off further from Q2’24 onwards, upside risks from geopolitical factors remain.

# To overcome Pakistan’s macroeconomic imbalances

The focus needs to be on improving governance and successful implementation of necessary reforms. Tax collection has improved over the years, but it is entirely due to over-taxing the already taxed. The government actively needs to introduce new taxation reforms, improve efficiency and broaden the tax base by introducing technology and simplifying the process. Financial support to loss making and inefficient SOEs are a major drag on the fiscal resources of the country and improving governance towards their eventual privatization should be a critical priority. Finally, the importance of graduating from the SBA to a larger and longer Extended Fund Facility cannot be overemphasized as this will provide both the fiscal space as well as the external stability for the Government to carry out much-needed structural reforms.

# HBL’s Performance

HBL has demonstrated resilience in a challenging environment, with the strong results a testament to the loyalty of our customers. HBL’s digital footprint and presence continues to grow exponentially, from Konnect to cash management to Treasury solutions. Over 4 million users of HBL Mobile and Internet Banking transacted over Rs 1.6 trillion in just the first quarter of 2024. Over the last few years, the Bank has played a pivotal role in strengthening Pakistan’s agriculture sector through its unique interventions which have doubled farmer incomes. In Q1’24 HBL formally launched HBL Zarai Services in Burewala, which will provide agriculture extension services to empower farmers and enhance productivity throughout the entire value chain. This is another landmark initiative by HBL and will Insha Allah transform the agriculture landscape of the country.

# Community Engagement

Q1’24 saw the successful conclusion of HBL PSL 9, an event now firmly established on the international cricket calendar; HBL’s nearly decade-long support to this major event has played a crucial role in normalizing cricket in Pakistan. In line with our commitment to give back to the community, HBL’s employees completed 2,000 volunteering hours in projects from tree planting to clean up drives to blood camps.

# Leadership Changes

Muhammad Aurangzeb, HBL’s President and CEO, stepped down from the Bank with effect from March 11, 2024 to take up the position of Minister for Finance and Revenue. HBL is extremely proud of Aurangzeb responding to the call of national service to carry forward the much-needed reform agenda. The Board wishes to place on record its appreciation for his enormous contributions to the Bank and stands firm in its resolve to providing support in the progress of Pakistan. The Board has appointed Muhammad Nassir Salim, who was serving as the Chief Operating Officer, as HBL’s President and CEO and wishes him every success in his new role.

# Appreciation and Acknowledgement

On behalf of the Board and management, we would like to place on record our appreciation for the efforts of our regulators and the Government of Pakistan, in particular the State Bank of Pakistan, the Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan. In these unprecedented and challenging times, they have stepped up with policies and measures that are prudent, proactive and balanced, protecting the economy, customers and people of Pakistan, while also safeguarding the integrity and soundness of the banking and financial services industry.

We are indebted to our customers, many of whom have banked with us for generations, and who continue to entrust us with their business and confidence. Our shareholders have provided steadfast support and to them, and to all our stakeholders, we are deeply grateful. The Board and the management remain committed to maintaining the highest standards of governance and we assure our stakeholders that we will be industry leaders in this area.

Lastly, but certainly not the least, we express our deepest appreciation and gratitude to our employees and their families, especially in customer facing units and branches, who continually go the extra mile, even at personal cost, to ensure that our customers are able to meet their critical needs. They are our heroes and heroines and we salute them for their dedication and tireless efforts.

On behalf of the Board

# 2.3 New standards and amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become effective in the current year

As directed by SBP via BPRD Circular letter no. 7 of 2023, IFRS 9, Financial Instruments is effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. IFRS 9 has been applicable in several overseas jurisdictions at various effective dates starting from January 1, 2018. The requirements of this standard are already incorporated in the Bank’s financial statements for the jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted. The results of those overseas operations where IFRS 9 is not applicable will be directly incorporated in the Bank’s financial statements as per the respective host country's regulations, for the year ending December 31, 2024.

Except for the implementation of IFRS 9 in Pakistan, as discussed in note 3.1, the Bank expects that amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards will not affect its financial statements in the period of initial application.

# 3.1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

# 3.1.1 Classification of Financial Assets

The Bank classifies its financial assets, other than its investments in subsidiaries and associates, into the following categories:

- at Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL);
- at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI);
- at Amortised Cost.

## Chunk 149


# Classification of Equity Instruments

Equity securities that are traded in an active market and are held for trading purposes will be classified as FVTPL. Equity securities that are not held for trading purposes will be classified as FVOCI; however, gains and losses on disposal of securities classified as FVOCI will not be recycled through the profit and loss account. The classification decision is made on a case by case basis at the time of purchase, is documented, and is irrevocable.

## Chunk 150


# Classification of other Financial Assets

Financial Assets other than equity will be classified based on their cash flow characteristics and business model assessment:

- Amortised Cost: These will be classified as amortised cost if the objective is to hold the asset only for collecting contractual cash flows (principal and interest).
- FVOCI: These will be classified at FVOCI when the objective is to collect contractual cash flows (principal and interest) and also to potentially sell the same depending on market conditions. Any unrealized profit or loss on debt instruments classified as FVOCI is reflected in other comprehensive income and is recycled through the profit and loss account when the investment is sold.

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

# FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024

For the three months ended March 31, 2024

- FVTPL: This includes financial assets:

1. which are not classified as either at amortised cost or FVOCI;
2. which do not have fixed maturity.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

# Subsequent Measurement

# Equity and debt securities classified as FVTPL

These securities are subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these securities are taken through the profit and loss account.

## Chunk 152


# Equity and debt securities classified as FVOCI

These securities are subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in OCI. When a debt security is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to the profit and loss account. When an equity security is derecognised, gains and losses previously recognised in OCI are not recycled through the profit and loss account but are transferred directly to retained earnings.

# Other financial assets classified at amortised cost

Other financial assets initially classified at amortised cost continue to be subsequently measured at amortised cost.

## Chunk 153


# 3.1.2 Classification of Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified at FVTPL, when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method.

---

{"chunk_number": 154, "financial_data": "yes", "financial_statement_scope": "unconsolidated", "is_statement": "no", "statement_type": "none", "is_note": "yes", "note_link": "none", "auditor_report": "no", "director_report": "no", "annual_report_discussion": "no", "file_name": "Habib_Bank_Limited_Quarterly_2024-03-31_chunks.md", "ticker": "HBL", "entity_name": "Habib Bank Limited", "filing_type": "quarterly", "filing_period": ["Q1-2024", "Q1-2023"]}
## Chunk 154


# 3.1.3 Impairment

An ECL provision will be calculated on financial assets designated at FVOCI or at Amortised cost in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9 and the guidelines issued by the SBP. Credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Equity securities are not subject to impairment.

## Chunk 155


# 3.1.4 Transitional Impact

The Bank has elected to follow the modified retrospective approach for restatement i.e. comparative figures have not been restated on the initial application of IFRS 9. Instead, the cumulative impact has been recorded as an adjustment to equity as of January 01, 2024. Accordingly, the information presented as of December 31, 2023 and for the period ended March 31, 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9.

# 3.2 Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance

The measurement of the ECL allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and at FVOCI is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behavior. A number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such as:

- Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL;
- Establishing groups of similar financial assets for the purpose of measuring ECL;
- Establishing the number and relative weightages of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios for each segment and the associated ECL; and
- Determining whether an asset shows a significant increase in credit risk.

# 3.3 Fair valuation of unlisted equity securities

The measurement of the fair value of investments in unquoted equity securities involves the use of different methodologies and assumptions. The Bank uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation techniques incorporate all the factors that market participants would consider in pricing a transaction.

| |The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term advances, fixed term deposits and borrowings, other assets and other liabilities, cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments and therefore, are not reported as part of this disclosure.| | |
| |In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings, are frequently repriced.| | |
| |All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements are categorised within the following fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.| | |
| |Level 1 - Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.| | |
| |Level 2 - Fair value measurements using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).| | |
| |Level 3 - Fair value measurements using inputs that are not based on observable market data.| | |

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within Level 2 and Level 3

Federal Government securities The fair values of Federal Government securities are determined on the basis of rates / prices sourced from Reuters.

Non-Government debt securities Non-Government debt securities denominated in Rupees are valued on the basis of rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP). Non-Government debt securities denominated in other currencies are valued on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg / Reuters.

Foreign Government debt securities The fair values of Foreign Government debt securities are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg / Reuters.

Unquoted equity securities The fair values of unquoted equity investments are estimated using the adjusted break-up value of the investee company. These are further discounted for marketability concerns. Where the agreed / indicative prices are available, the Bank uses the same as an estimate for fair value.

Units of mutual funds The fair values of units of mutual funds are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of each business day.

Derivatives The Bank enters into derivatives contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques based on market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.

Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.

Property and equipment and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity, required for Level 3 assets, has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.
