# Economy Review

2024 was a pivotal year of recovery and stabilization in Pakistan’s economy. Post general elections in February 2024, a new coalition government took charge in March 2024. Subsequently, the country successfully reached a Staff-Level Agreement for a USD 7 billion, 37-month EFF IMF program in September 2024, ensuring vital financial support on the external front.

The country's external account position improved remarkably in 2024, with the current account posting a surplus of USD 912 million. This is the first annual current account surplus achieved since 2004. A major driver of the external account stability was worker remittances, which grew by 32% YoY to total USD 34.7bn in 2024. Although the trade deficit did increase to USD 23.4 billion this year from USD 19.5 billion in the previous year, a healthy 11% growth was witnessed in exports.

The Credit Risk Division is responsible for managing and overseeing risk across corporate, SME, financial institutions, and international portfolios. It plays a pivotal role in reviewing and approving credit proposals, ensuring that the bank maintains a high standard of credit quality through effective portfolio management. Additionally, the division actively monitors ongoing credit performance, identifying potential risks and raising timely alerts when necessary.

During the year, several initiatives such as selective onboarding of high-quality assets within advances, focus on cost efficiencies, proactive portfolio management, mapping of policies with domestic structure as well as gap analysis of local regulatory guidelines continued.

The Consumer Credit portfolio has continued to sustain its steady growth under a well-managed risk environment. The controlled level of portfolio delinquencies is owed to robust portfolio management for NPLs including but not limited to stress testing. Periodic review of policies along with automation in risk management procedures ensured a well aligned risk and reward profile of the portfolio.

The role of Market & Treasury Risk includes defining and implementing a market risk management framework to systematically identify, assess, monitor, mitigate, and report market related risks. The day-to-day market risk management activities are being performed through use of effective risk management tools and processes. The aim of risk identification and assessment is to mitigate the risk impacts on bank’s financial earnings, long-term strategic goals, and institution reputation with a mindset to facilitate business growth within a controlled and transparent overall risk management framework.

The objective of the Bank’s liquidity risk management framework is to ensure that the Bank is able to fulfill its payment obligations at all times and manage its liquidity risk within the defined tolerance level. The framework entails a comprehensive Liquidity Risk Procedural Manual and well-defined procedures along with an effective Contingency Funding Plan.

We are only required and have ensured compliance of this requirement to the extent of the approval of the related party transactions by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the Statement of Compliance does not appropriately reflect the Bank's compliance, in all material respects, with the requirements contained in the Regulations as applicable to the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2024.

# Key Audit Matters

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

|Key audit matters|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|
|1. Expected credit loss against advances|As disclosed in Note 9 to the unconsolidated financial statements, the Bank’s advances represent 17.9% of its total assets as of 31 December 2024. During the year, the Bank has adopted IFRS 9 - “Financial Instruments” (as applicable in Pakistan), which requires a forward-looking approach to estimate the Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”) against advances and other financial instruments. As allowed under IFRS 9, the Bank has adopted the requirements of the standard retrospectively, without restating the previous year’s financial information. The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in a transition adjustment to the retained earnings as of 1 January 2024 of Rs. 4,327.814 million. The impact of transition is explained in Note 2.6.1.3 to the unconsolidated financial statements. In view of the significance of this area in terms of its impact on the unconsolidated financial statements, and level of involvement of management’s estimates and judgments, we identified adequacy and completeness of ECL against advances as a key audit matter. - We applied a range of audit procedures including the following:
- We reviewed the management’s process of assessment of allowance for ECL against advances including the Bank’s accounting policy and ECL model methodology adopted during the year.
- We performed procedures to test: - the governance of ECL models and their validation, including relevant approvals.
- completeness and accuracy of critical data inputs into the ECL models and calculations.
- timely identification of SICR and the determination of individually impaired exposures.
- the management’s assessment of recoverable cash flows, including the impact of collateral, if any, and ECL computation for exposures.
- Where required, we involved our experts to assist us in reviewing model calculations, evaluating interrelated inputs (including EADs, PDs and LGDs) and assessing reasonableness of assumptions used in the ECL models.
We also assessed adequacy of disclosures as included in Note 9.4 to the unconsolidated financial statements regarding the ECL made against advances in accordance with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework.|

# Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

There are certain amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become applicable to the Bank for accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2024.

# 2.6.1 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

# 2.6.1.1

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 (read with IFRS 9 application instructions issued by SBP) retrospectively with date of initial application as January 01, 2024, which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements. In terms of the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening unappropriated profit and other reserves at the beginning of the current period without restating the comparative figures. Therefore, the comparative information for 2023 is not comparable for 2024. The impact on carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities is disclosed in Note 2.6.1.3.

# 2.6.1.2 Scope of IFRS 9 application

IFRS 9 has been applicable in several overseas jurisdictions at various effective dates starting from January 01, 2018. The requirements of this standard were already incorporated in the Bank’s financial statements for the jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted in accordance with the financial reporting regimes of their respective jurisdictions. The results of those overseas operations where IFRS 9 is not applicable will be directly incorporated in the Bank’s financial statements as per the respective jurisdiction's regulations, for the year ending December 31, 2024. As per the SBP IFRS 9 application instructions, all overseas jurisdictions will be subject to the IFRS 9 requirements from next financial year.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

The following explains how applying the new classification requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Bank as shown in the table above:

---

{"chunk_number": 134, "financial_data": "yes", "financial_statement_scope": "unconsolidated", "is_statement": "no", "statement_type": "none", "is_note": "yes", "note_link": "balance_sheet", "auditor_report": "no", "director_report": "no", "annual_report_discussion": "no", "file_name": "United_Bank_Limited_Annual_2024_chunks.md", "ticker": "UBL", "entity_name": "United Bank Limited", "filing_type": "annual", "filing_period": ["2024", "2023"]}
## Chunk 134


# (A) Debt instruments previously classified as available for sale (AFS) but which fail the SPPI test

The Bank held a portfolio of debt instruments amounting to Rs. 1,864.933 million that failed to meet the SPPI requirement for amortised cost classification under IFRS 9. These instruments contain provisions that, in certain circumstances, can allow the issuer to defer interest payments, but which do not accrue additional interest. This clause breaches the criterion that interest payments should only be consideration for credit risk and the time value of money on the principal. As a result these are required to be classified as FVTPL under IFRS 9.

# (B) Designation of equity instruments at FVOCI

The Bank has elected to irrevocably designate investments in listed securities and strategic investments in unquoted securities as FVOCI amounting to Rs. 10,228.156 million and Rs. 720.004 million, respectively. These securities were previously classified as available for sale. The changes in fair value of such securities will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss when they are disposed of.

# (C) Reclassification from retired categories with no change in measurement

In addition to the above, the following debt instruments have been reclassified to new categories under IFRS 9, as their previous categories under existing local regulations were ‘retired’, with no changes to their measurement basis:

- Those previously classified as available for sale and now classified as measured at FVOCI;
- Those previously classified as held to maturity and now classified as measured at amortised cost; and
- Those previously classified as held for trading and now classified as measured at FVTPL.

The impact of transition to IFRS 9 on unappropriated profit and surplus on revaluation of investments is as follows:

|Surplus / (Deficit) on revaluation|Unappropriated profit|Total (Rupees in '000)| | | | | | |

# 2.8 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Significant accounting estimates and areas where judgments were made by management in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

- i) Fair valuation of financial assets (notes 4.2.2.2, 4.2.2.3, 4.2.2.4 and 8).
- ii) Expected credit loss allowance against financial assets (notes 4.2.6, 8.3, 9.4 and 9.6).
- iii) Income taxes (notes 4.18 and 35).
- iv) Defined benefit plans (notes 4.20 and 39).
- v) Fair value of derivatives (note 4.4 and 25).
- vi) Revaluation and depreciation of property and equipment (notes 4.12 and 10).
- vii) Amortisation of intangible assets (note 4.14 and 12).
- viii) Incremental borrowing rate for leases (notes 4.13).
- ix) Valuation of non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims (note 4.15).

# Initial measurement

On initial recognition, financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) are initially measured at their fair value. The initial measurement of other financial instruments is based on their fair value, but adjusted in respect of any transaction costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial instrument. Other assets and Other liabilities are measured at the transaction price.

When the transaction price of the instrument differs from the fair value at origination and the fair value is based on a valuation technique using only inputs observable in market transactions, the Bank recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value in profit and loss account. In those cases where fair value is based on models for which some of the inputs are not observable, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value is deferred and is only recognised in profit and loss account when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

# 4.2.2 Classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets

Financial assets are classified into following categories for measurement subsequent to initial recognition:

- Equity instruments at 'fair value through other comprehensive income' FVOCI
- Financial assets at 'fair value through profit or loss' FVTPL

# 4.2.2.1 Financial assets at amortised cost

The Bank classifies its financial assets at amortized cost only if both of the following conditions are met:

- The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows
- The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

## Chunk 146


# 4.2.2.2 Debt instruments at FVOCI

The Bank applies this new category under IFRS 9 when both of the following conditions are met:

- The instrument is held within a business model, the objective of which is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
- The contractual terms of the financial asset meet the SPPI test

FVOCI debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising due to changes in fair value recognised in OCI. Interest income at EIR and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account.

The ECLs for debt instruments measured at FVOCI do not reduce the carrying amount of these financial assets in the statement of financial position, which remains at fair value. Instead, an amount equal to the allowance that would arise if the assets were measured at amortised cost is recognised in OCI as an accumulated impairment amount, with a corresponding charge to profit and loss account. The accumulated loss recognised in OCI is recycled to the profit and loss account upon derecognition of the assets.

# 4.2.2.3 Equity instruments at FVOCI

Upon initial recognition, the Bank elects to classify irrevocably some of its equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI when they meet the definition of 'Equity' under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable.

Gains and losses on these equity instruments are never recycled to profit and loss account. Dividends are recognised in profit and loss account when the right of the payment has been established, except when the Bank benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment.

# 4.2.2.4 Financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL

Financial assets and financial liabilities in this category are those that are:

- held for trading, that is, they have been purchased or issued primarily for short-term profit-making through trading activities or form part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together, for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit taking, or
- not held for trading and have been either designated by management upon initial recognition, or mandatorily required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9

Financial assets are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in profit and loss account. Interest and dividend income or expense is recorded in net trading income according to the terms of the contract, or when the right to payment has been established.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Bank's original expectations, the Bank does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.

# 4.2.3 Derecognition of financial assets

# 4.2.3.1 Derecognition due to substantial modification of terms and conditions

The Bank derecognises a financial asset, such as a loan to a customer, when the terms and conditions have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new loan, with the difference recognised as a derecognition gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The newly recognised loan is classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes, unless it is deemed to be purchased originated credit impaired. When assessing whether or not to derecognise a loan to a customer, amongst others, the Bank considers qualitative factors such as change in currency of the loan, introduction of an equity feature, change in counterparty, or if the modification is such that the instrument would no longer meet the SPPI criterion.

If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different, the modification does not result in derecognition. Based on the change in cash flows discounted at the original EIR, the Bank records a modification gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded.

# 4.2.3.2 Derecognition other than due to substantial modification of terms and conditions

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The Bank also derecognises the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition. The difference between the carrying value (including impairment) of a financial asset and the consideration received is recognized in profit and loss account.

# 4.2.4 Derecognition of financial liabilities

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. The difference between the carrying value of the financial liability and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss account.

# 4.2.5 Write-offs

Financial assets are written off when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. The amount so written-off is a book entry and does not necessarily prejudice the Bank's right of recovery against the defaulter.

# 4.2.6 Impairment of financial assets

# 4.2.6.1 Overview of the ECL principles

The adoption of IFRS 9 has fundamentally changed the Bank’s loan loss impairment method by replacing the incurred loss approach of the local regulations with a forward-looking ECL approach. The Bank has been recording the allowance for expected credit losses for all advances and other debt financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI, together with loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantee contracts. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under IFRS 9. Under the SBP's instructions, local currency credit exposures guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss (LTECL)), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its financial assets into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

- Stage 1: When loans are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 loans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 2.
- Stage 2: When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination (SICR), the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 3.
- Stage 3: Loans considered credit-impaired. The Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs with PD set at 100%. Under SBP's instructions, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, Stage 3 allowance would be taken as as higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under Prudential Regulations.

# 4.2.6.2 The calculation of ECLs

The key elements of ECL calculations are as follows:

- The Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Through the yearly review of the internally rated advances (Corporate and Commercial/SME portfolios) and non-rated Consumer portfolios, Staff Loans and Investments, the Bank has drawn an yearly transition matrix of ratings and DPD buckets, respectively, to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the last ten years. For externally rated Investments PD tables from External Rating Agencies are used. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.
- The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, accrued interest from missed payments and amortization.
- The Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive. The Bank estimates LGD based on the history of recovery rates and considers the recovery of any liquid collateral for each group of financial instruments. LGDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.

The interest rate used to discount the ECLs would be based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three probability-weighted scenarios (a base case, a best case, and a worse case).

Each of these is associated with different PDs, EADs and LGDs. These expected probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. This calculation is made for each of the three scenarios. With the exception of credit cards and other revolving facilities, the maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has the legal right to call it earlier. For credit cards and revolving facilities based on past experience and the Bank’s expectations, the Bank calculates ECL for these products over their behavioral life. Impairment losses and releases are accounted for and disclosed separately from modification losses or gains that are accounted for as an adjustment of the financial asset’s gross carrying value.

# 4.2.6.3 Significant increase in credit risk

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank uses both qualitative and quantitative criteria for determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. These include comparing lifetime PD at the reporting date with the lifetime PD at the initial recognition of the financial asset, a backstop of thirty days past due on the contractual payments, considerable deterioration in the internal or external rating (as the case maybe), moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. However, for certain portfolios, the Bank rebutts 30 days past due presumption based on behavioural analysis of its borrowers.

# 4.2.6.4 Definition of default

The Bank considers a financial instrument defaulted for ECL calculations in all cases when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments, except for agricultural loans which are considered defaulted at 365 days past due. The Bank also considers a variety of instances that may indicate unlikeliness to pay. When such events occur, the Bank carefully considers whether the event should result in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as Stage 3 for ECL calculations or whether Stage 2 is appropriate.

# 4.3.1.10 Impairment of available for sale equity investments

Available for sale equity investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in their fair value below their cost. The determination of what is significant or prolonged requires judgment. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates, among other factors, the normal volatility in share price. A subsequent increase in the fair value of a previously impaired listed equity security is recorded in the statement of financial position in the surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities account and only recorded through the profit and loss account when realised on disposal.

The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The lease liability is also remeasured to reflect any reassessment or lease modification.

Receivables under Murabaha financing represent cost price plus an agreed profit on deferred sale arrangement. Profit could be recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the instalments.

Ijarah financing represents arrangements whereby the Bank (being the owner of assets) transfers its usufruct to its customers for an agreed period at an agreed consideration (rentals). Assets leased out under Ijarah are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. These are depreciated over the term of the lease. Ijarah income is recognised on an accrual basis.

Diminishing Musharakah is partnership agreement between the Bank and its customer for long term financing of assets. The receivable is recorded to the extent of Bank's share in the purchase of asset. Income is recognised on accrual basis.

Istisna is a sale contract where the Bank places an order to the manufacturer / builders to produce certain assets and the sale is completed upon the delivery of the assets to the ultimate buyer.

Running Musharakah facility is to finance the working capital requirement of the customer whereas partnership is based on particular operations of the business.

# 4.12 Property and equipment

Property and equipment, other than land (which is not depreciated) and capital work-in-progress, are stated at cost or revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Land is carried at revalued amount less impairment losses while capital work-in-progress is stated at cost less impairment losses. The cost and the accumulated depreciation of property and equipment of overseas branches include exchange differences arising on currency translation at the year-end rates of exchange.

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the depreciable amount of the assets over their expected useful lives at the rates specified in note 10.2 to these unconsolidated financial statements. The depreciation charge for the year is calculated on a straight line basis after taking into account the residual value, if any. The residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.

Depreciation on additions is charged from the month the asset is available for use. No depreciation is charged in the month of disposal.

Land and buildings are revalued by independent, professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. An increase arising on revaluation is credited to the surplus on revaluation of fixed assets account. A decrease arising on revaluation of fixed assets is adjusted against the surplus of that asset or, if no surplus exists, is charged to the profit and loss account as an impairment of the asset. A surplus arising subsequently on an impaired asset is reversed through the profit and loss account up to the extent of the original impairment.

All direct costs of acquiring title to asset are charged to the profit and loss account. Gains and losses on sale of non-banking assets are included in the profit and loss account, except that the related surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets (net of deferred tax) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation. These assets are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. A surplus arising on revaluation of property is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets' account. A decrease arising on revaluation of non-banking asset is adjusted against the surplus of that asset or, if no surplus exists, is charged to the profit and loss account as an impairment of the asset.

# 4.17 Impairment of investments in subsidiaries and associates

The Bank considers that a decline in the recoverable value of the investment in a subsidiary or an associate below its cost may be evidence of impairment. Recoverable value is calculated as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable value falls below the carrying value and is charged to the profit and loss account. A subsequent reversal of an impairment loss, up to the cost of the investment in the subsidiary or the associate, is credited to the profit and loss account.

# 4.20.2 Remeasurement of defined benefit obligations

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method on all major temporary differences between the amounts attributed to assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply to the period when the differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income when they occur with no subsequent recycling through the profit and loss account. Remeasurement gains and losses pertaining to long term compensated absences are recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.

# 4.21 Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognised to the extent that the economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the Bank and the revenue can be reliably measured. The following recognition criteria must be met before revenue is recognised.

# 4.21.2 Lease financing

Income from lease financing is accounted for using the financing method. Under this method, the unearned lease income (defined as the sum of total lease rentals and estimated residual value less the cost of the leased assets) is deferred and taken to income over the term of the lease so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding net investment in the lease. Gains or losses on termination of lease contracts are recognised through the profit and loss account when these are realised. Unrealised lease income and other fees on classified leases are recognised on a receipt basis.

# 4.21.3 Dividend income

# 22.3

In 2007, the Bank was admitted to the official list of the UK Listing Authority and to the London Stock Exchange Professional Securities Market for trading of Global Depository Receipts (GDRs), each representing four ordinary shares issued by the Bank. The GDRs constitute an offering in the United States only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S Securities Act of 1933 and an offering outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. Holders of GDRs are entitled, subject to the provisions of the depository agreement, to receive dividends, if any, and rank pari passu with other equity shareholders in respect of such entitlement. However, the holders of GDRs have no voting rights or other direct rights of shareholders with respect to the ordinary shares underlying such GDRs. Subject to the terms and restrictions set out in the offering circular dated June 25, 2007, the deposited ordinary shares in respect of which the GDRs were issued may be withdrawn by the GDR holders from the depository facility. Upon withdrawal, the holders will rank pari passu with other ordinary shareholders in respect of voting powers. As at December 31, 2024, 242,278 (2023: 242,278) GDRs, representing 969,112 (2023: 969,112) shares are in issue.

# 39.14 Significant Risks

The significant risks associated with the staff retirement benefit schemes are as follows:

- Asset Volatility: The risk arises due to inclusion of risky assets in the funds portfolio, inflation, interest rate volatility and change in price.
- Changes in Bond Yields: The risk arises when bond yield is lower than the expected return on the planned assets (duration based PIB discount rate).
- Price Risk: The risk arises when there is volatility in market price of the equity instrument invested by Funds.
- Inflation Risk: The salary inflation is the major risk that the Gratuity and Compensated absences liability carries.
- Withdrawal Risk: Withdrawal risks is the risk of higher or lower withdrawal experience than assumed.
- Other Risks: Though, not imminent and generally observable, over long term there are some risks that may crystallise.

# 42. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to collect model, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as "held to collect" are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

# Notes to and forming part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 42.1 The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

|Non-Government debt securities|The fair value of non-government debt securities is determined using the prices / rates from MUFAP.|
|Foreign debt securities|The fair value of foreign corporate and foreign government securities is determined using the rates from Bloomberg.|
|Mutual Fund units|The fair values of investments in units of mutual funds are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of each business day.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities|The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.|
|Derivatives|The fair valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.|
|Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these unconsolidated financial statements.|

The SBP through its BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 has prescribed the minimum paid-up capital (net of accumulated losses) for Banks to be raised to Rs.10,000 million by the year ending December 31, 2015. The paid-up capital of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2024 stood at Rs.12,241.797 million (2023: Rs.12,241.797 million) and is in compliance with SBP requirements. Banks are also required to maintain a minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 10.0% plus capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of the risk weighted exposures of the Bank.

In order to dampen the effects of COVID-19, the State Bank of Pakistan under BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020 has given a regulatory relief and reduced the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) as prescribed vide BPRD Circular No. 6 of August 15, 2013, for the time being, from its existing level of 2.5% to 1.5%, till further instructions.

Furthermore, under Basel III instructions, Banks are also required to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio and Tier 1 ratio of 6.0% and 7.5%, respectively, as at December 31, 2024. The Bank is fully compliant with prescribed ratios as the Bank’s CAR is 20.31% whereas CET 1 and Tier 1 ratios stood at 14.63% and 15.26% respectively.

Under the current capital adequacy regulations, credit risk and market risk exposures are measured using the Standardised Approach and operational risk is measured using the Basic Indicator Approach. Credit risk mitigants are applied against the Bank’s exposures based on eligible collateral under comprehensive approach.

The Capital Adequacy Ratio excluding the transition benefit of ECL (net of tax) on adoption of IFRS 9 would be lower by 29bps as at December 31, 2024.

The full disclosures on the CAPITAL ADEQUACY, LEVERAGE RATIO & LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS as per SBP instructions issued from time to time are placed on the website. The link to the full disclosure is available at https://www.ubldigital.com/Investor-Relations/CAR-Statements.aspx.

The SBP through its BPRD circular letter no. 2 of 2025 dated January 24, 2025 has instructed to treat Foreign Exchange Translation Reserve as part of Common Equity Tier-1 (CET-1) capital with effect from December 31, 2024. The foreign exchange translation had been reported as TIER II capital for all periods prior to December 31, 2024.

# 47.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange (FX) risk arises from the fluctuation in the value of assets and liabilities due to the changes in foreign exchange rates.

The FX risk and associated concentration risk is managed through approved currency wise net open position limits, tenor and currency wise Gap limits and an overall Foreign Exchange Exposure Limit (FEEL).

The currency risk is effectively monitored against the applicable regulatory limits. Market risk monitors the FX exposure to ensure that it remains within the limits prescribed by SBP and internal limits approved by GALCO.

Interest rate risk is the risk that fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in interest rates, including changes in the shape of yield curves. Interest rate risk is inherent in the overall business of the Bank and arises from mismatches between the contractual maturities and the re-pricing of on and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities.

Interest rate risk is monitored and managed by performing periodic gap analysis, sensitivity analysis and stress testing. In case of any distressed event the results and corresponding action plan is presented at the relevant management / BoD committee.

# Operational risk

Operational risk is recognized as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. In compliance with the Regulatory Guidelines, an Operational Risk Division is established within Risk & Credit Policy Group. Operational Risk Division is primarily responsible for the oversight of operational risk management across the Bank including International locations. The implementation of operational risk management framework is supported by operational risk management system and designated operational risk coordinators within different units across the Bank. The framework is in line with regulatory guidelines, international best practices, flexible enough to implement in stages and permits the overall approach to evolve in response to organizational learning and future requirements.

In accordance with the Operational Risk framework, a database covering losses, control breaches and near misses is being maintained by the division. Major risk events are analysed from the control breach perspective and mitigating controls are assessed on design and operating effectiveness. Quarterly updates on Operational Risk events are being presented to the Senior Management and Board Risk & Compliance Committee of the Bank. Periodic workshops are conducted for Risk & Control Self-Assessment and key risk exposures are identified and assessed against existing controls to evaluate improvement opportunities. Key Risk Indicators are also defined for monitoring of risk exposures. New products, systems, activities and processes, are subject to comprehensive operational risk assessments, before implementation.

Business Continuity Plans have been implemented across the Bank, clearly defining the roles and responsibilities of respective stakeholders, and covering recovery strategy, IT and structural backups, scenario and impact analyses and testing directives. Business Continuity Plans (BCP) for respective areas are in place and tested under domain of Operations Group.

# Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that a bank, though solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet all its obligations and commitments as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive costs.

# Bank’s treasury banks

UBL actively manages the risk through a set of qualitative and quantitative risk management techniques. The Global Assets and Liabilities Management Committee (GALCO) of the Bank is responsible for the oversight of liquidity management and meets at least on a monthly basis or more frequently, if required. A centralized approach is adopted, based on an integrated framework incorporating an assessment of all material known and expected cash flows and the availability of collateral which could be used to secure additional funding if required. The framework entails careful monitoring and control of the daily liquidity position, and regular liquidity stress testing under a variety of scenarios. These encompass both normal and stressed market conditions, including general market crises and the possibility that access to markets could be impacted by a stress event affecting some part of the Bank’s business.

It is the policy to maintain adequate liquidity at all times, in order to meet all obligations, repay depositors and fulfill commitments to lend under both normal and stressed conditions.

Liquidity risk measures comprises of various risk management tools including concentration ratios, Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) and liquidity gaps.

The Bank has a comprehensive Contingency Funding Plan in place which clearly defines and identifies the trigger events that could cause a liquidity crisis and describes the actions to be taken to manage the crisis and return the Bank to business as usual.

# Liquidity risk

Derivatives transactions, usually being non-funded in nature, do not carry a specific funding liquidity risk. The liquidity risk arises from the fact that in Pakistan, interest rate derivatives generally have a uni-directional demand, and no perfect hedge is available. The Bank mitigates its risk by limiting the portfolio in terms of tenor, notional and sensitivity limits, and can also hedge its risk by taking on and off balance sheet positions in the interbank market, where available.

# Operational risk

The staff involved in the trading, settlement and risk management of derivatives is carefully trained to deal with the complexities involved in the process. Adequate systems and controls are in place to carry out derivatives transactions smoothly. Each transaction is processed in accordance with the product program or a transaction memo, which contains detailed guidance on the accounting and operational aspects of the transaction to further mitigate operational risk. In addition, M&TR and the Compliance and Control Department are assigned the responsibility of monitoring any deviation from policies and procedures. The Bank’s Audit and Inspection Group also reviews this function, with a regular review of systems, transactional processes, accounting practices and end-user roles and responsibilities.

# 48. YEMEN OPERATIONS

Despite risky situation and continued operational losses the Bank has been striving to honor liabilities for past eight years. However, on account of several factors, including but not limited to fragile political and economic situation in Yemen, bankruptcy of CBY Sana’a, existence of two Central Banks (i.e. CBY Sana’a and CBY Aden), has resulted in illiquid market, which does not appears to be reversed in near future.

It is no longer possible for the Bank to continue its operations in Yemen due to reasons not attributable to the Bank and caused by circumstances entirely beyond the Bank’s control. Therefore, Bank has completely exited from Yemen. The Bank is cognizant of the associated risks arising out of its exit from Yemen.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Pakistan. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants as adopted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (the Code) and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# 1. Expected credit loss against advances

As disclosed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group’s advances represent 17.9% of its total assets as of 31 December 2024. During the year, the Group has adopted IFRS 9 ‐ “Financial Instruments” (as applicable in Pakistan), which requires a forward‐looking approach to estimate the Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”) against advances and other financial instruments. As allowed under IFRS 9, the Group has adopted the requirements of the standard retrospectively, without restating the previous year’s financial information. The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in a transition adjustment to the retained earnings as of 1 January 2024 of Rs. 4,327.814 million. The impact of transition is explained in Note 2.6.1.3 to the consolidated financial statements.

In view of the significance of this area in terms of its impact on the consolidated financial statements, and level of involvement of management’s estimates and judgments, we identified adequacy and completeness of ECL against advances as a key audit matter. The accounting policy and disclosures related to the ECL against advances are included in Notes 4.2 and 9.4 respectively to the consolidated financial statements.

We applied a range of audit procedures including the following:

- We reviewed the management’s process of assessment of allowance for ECL against advances including the Group’s accounting policy and ECL model methodology adopted during the year.
- We performed procedures to test:
- the governance of ECL models and their validation, including relevant approvals.
- completeness and accuracy of critical data inputs into the ECL models and calculations.
- timely identification of SICR and the determination of individually impaired exposures.
- the management’s assessment of recoverable cash flows, including the impact of collateral, if any, and ECL computation for exposures.
- Where required, we involved our experts to assist us in reviewing model calculations, evaluating interrelated inputs (including EADs, PDs and LGDs) and assessing reasonableness of assumptions used in the ECL models.
- We also assessed adequacy of disclosures as included in Note 9.4 to the consolidated financial statements regarding the ECL made against advances in accordance with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework.

# Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Omer Chughtai.

# 2.6.1 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

# 2.6.1.1 The Bank has adopted IFRS 9

(read with IFRS 9 application instructions issued by SBP) retrospectively with date of initial application as January 01, 2024, which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements. In terms of the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening unappropriated profit and other reserves at the beginning of the current period without restating the comparative figures. Therefore, the comparative information for 2023 is not comparable for 2024. The impact on carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities is disclosed in Note 2.6.1.3.

# IFRS 18 - Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements

In April 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 18, which replaces IAS 1. IFRS 18 introduces new requirements for presentation of various items within the statement of profit or loss, including specified totals and subtotals. Narrow-scope amendments have been made to IAS 7, which include changing the starting point for determining cash flows from operations under the indirect method, from ‘profit or loss’ to ‘operating profit or loss’ and removing the optionality around classification of cash flows from dividends and interest. In addition, there are consequential amendments to several other standards. Earlier application is permitted and must be disclosed. IFRS 18 will apply retrospectively. The Bank is currently working to identify all impacts the amendments will have on the consolidated financial statements of future period and notes thereto.

# 2.8 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

# 4.2.1 Initial recognition

Date of initial recognition: Advances are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ accounts. The Bank recognises Deposits and Bills payable when funds are transferred to the Bank. Other financial assets and liabilities, are initially recognised on the trade date. This includes regular way trades.

Initial measurement: On initial recognition, financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) are initially measured at their fair value. The initial measurement of other financial instruments is based on their fair value, but adjusted in respect of any transaction costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial instrument. Other assets and Other liabilities are measured at the transaction price.

When the transaction price of the instrument differs from the fair value at origination and the fair value is based on a valuation technique using only inputs observable in market transactions, the Bank recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value in profit and loss account. In those cases where fair value is based on models for which some of the inputs are not observable, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value is deferred and is only recognised in profit and loss account when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

# 4.2.2.1 Financial assets at amortised cost

The Bank classifies its financial assets at amortized cost only if both of the following conditions are met:

- The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows
- The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding

The details of these conditions are outlined below:

# 4.2.2.5 Financial liabilities at amortised cost

These include Bills payable, Borrowings, Deposits, Subordinated debts and certain items within Other Liabilities.

# 4.2.3 Derecognition of financial assets

# 4.2.3.1 Derecognition due to substantial modification of terms and conditions

The Bank derecognises a financial asset, such as a loan to a customer, when the terms and conditions have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new loan, with the difference recognised as a derecognition gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The newly recognised loan is classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes, unless it is deemed to be purchased originated credit impaired. When assessing whether or not to derecognise a loan to a customer, amongst others, the Bank considers qualitative factors such as change in currency of the loan, introduction of an equity feature, change in counterparty, or if the modification is such that the instrument would no longer meet the SPPI criterion.

If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different, the modification does not result in derecognition. Based on the change in cash flows discounted at the original EIR, the Bank records a modification gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded.

# 4.2.3.2 Derecognition other than due to substantial modification of terms and conditions

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The Bank also derecognises the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.

The difference between the carrying value (including impairment) of a financial asset and the consideration received is recognized in profit and loss account.

# 4.2.4 Derecognition of financial liabilities

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. The difference between the carrying value of the financial liability and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss account.

# 4.2.5 Write-offs

Financial assets are written off when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. The amount so written-off is a book entry and does not necessarily prejudice the Bank's right of recovery against the defaulter.

# 4.2.6 Impairment of financial assets

# 4.2.6.1 Overview of the ECL principles

The adoption of IFRS 9 has fundamentally changed the Bank’s loan loss impairment method by replacing the incurred loss approach of the local regulations with a forward-looking ECL approach. The Bank has been recording the allowance for expected credit losses for all loans and other debt financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI, together with loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantee contracts. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under IFRS 9. Under the SBP's instructions, local currency credit exposures guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss (LTECL)), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL).

The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.

# 4.2.6.2 The calculation of ECLs

The key elements of ECL calculations are as follows:

- The Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the last 7 years. PDs for Non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.

# 4.2.6.1 Exposure at Default (EAD)

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, accrued interest from missed payments and amortization.

# 4.2.6.2 Loss Given Default (LGD)

The Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive. The Bank estimates LGD based on the history of recovery rates and considers the recovery of any liquid collateral for each group of financial instruments. LGDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.

The interest rate used to discount the ECLs would be based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities.

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three probability-weighted scenarios (a base case, a best case, and a worse case). Each of these is associated with different PDs, EADs and LGDs. These expected probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. This calculation is made for each of the three scenarios.

With the exception of credit cards and other revolving facilities, the maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has the legal right to call it earlier. For credit cards and revolving facilities based on past experience and the Bank’s expectations, the Bank calculates ECL for these products over their behavioral life.

Impairment losses and releases are accounted for and disclosed separately from modification losses or gains that are accounted for as an adjustment of the financial asset’s gross carrying value.

# 4.2.6.3 Significant increase in credit risk

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument.

The Bank uses both qualitative and quantitative criteria for determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. These include comparing lifetime PD at the reporting date with the lifetime PD at the initial recognition of the financial asset, a backstop of thirty days past due on the contractual payments, considerable deterioration in the internal or external rating (as the case maybe), moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. However, for certain portfolios, the Bank rebutts 30 days past due presumption based on behavioural analysis of its borrowers.

# 4.2.6.4 Definition of default

The Bank considers a financial instrument defaulted for ECL calculations in all cases when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments, except for agricultural loans which are considered defaulted at 365 days past due. The Bank also considers a variety of instances that may indicate unlikeliness to pay. When such events occur, the Bank carefully considers whether the event should result in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as Stage 3 for ECL calculations or whether Stage 2 is appropriate.

# 4.2.6.5 Forward looking information

The Bank formulates a base case view of the future direction of relevant economic variables and a representative range of other possible forecast scenarios and consideration of a variety of external actual and forecast information. This process involves developing three different economic scenarios, which represent a range of scenarios linked to GDP growth, CPI and Gross government debt and Unemployment rate.

# 4.3.1.4 Initial measurement

All “regular way” purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Bank commits to purchase or sell the investment. Regular way purchases or sales of investments require delivery within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

Investments are initially recognised at fair value which, in the case of investments other than held for trading, includes transaction costs associated with the investments. Transaction costs on investments held for trading are expensed as incurred.

# 4.3.1.5 Subsequent measurement

# 4.3.1.6 Held for trading

These are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Gains and losses on re-measurement are included in the profit and loss account.

# 4.3.1.7 Held to maturity

These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment loss recognised to reflect irrecoverable amounts.

# 4.3.1.8 Available for sale

Quoted securities classified as available for sale investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Any surplus or deficit arising thereon is kept in a separate account shown in the statement of financial position as part of the equity and is taken to the profit and loss account when realised upon disposal or when the investment is considered to be impaired.

Unquoted equity securities are valued at the lower of cost and break-up value. The break-up value of these securities is calculated with reference to the net assets of the investee company as per the latest available audited financial statements. A decline in the carrying value is charged to the profit and loss account. A subsequent increase in the carrying value, up to the cost of the investment, is credited to the profit and loss account. Investments in other unquoted securities are valued at cost less impairment, if any.

# 4.3.1.9 Impairment

# 4.3.1.10 Impairment of available for sale equity investments

Available for sale equity investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in their fair value below their cost. The determination of what is significant or prolonged requires judgment. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates, among other factors, the normal volatility in share price. A subsequent increase in the fair value of a previously impaired listed equity security is recorded in the statement of financial position in the surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities account and only recorded through the profit and loss account when realised on disposal.

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (Repo) at a specified future date are not derecognised from the statement of financial position as the Bank retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. The corresponding cash received is recognized in the statement of financial position as an asset with a corresponding obligation to return it, including accrued interest within 'Borrowings', reflecting the transaction’s economic substance as a loan to the Bank. The difference between the sale and repurchase prices is recorded as 'Interest expense' and is accrued over the life of the agreement using the contractual rate. When the counterparty has the right to sell or re-pledge the securities, the Bank reclassifies those securities in its statement of financial position to indicate that they are pledged as collateral.

# 4.9 Basis of consolidation

# 4.9.1 Subsidiaries

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Bank and its subsidiary companies. All subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group until the date that control ceases.

The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Holding Company, using accounting policies that are consistent with those of the Holding Company, except for non-banking subsidiaries in Pakistan which follow the requirements of IFRS 9 and IAS 40, and overseas subsidiaries which are required to comply with local regulations enforced within the respective jurisdictions.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

The Group recognises non-controlling interests (NCI) in subsidiaries at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the net assets. NCI in the equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated profit and loss account, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of changes in equity.

# 4.10 Cash and cash equivalents

# 4.12 Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control. This is generally the case where the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, after initially being recognised at cost.

Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit or loss, and the Group’s share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.

When the Group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in these entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

# 4.14 Islamic financings and related assets

Receivables under Murabaha financing represent cost price plus an agreed profit on deferred sale arrangement. Profit could be recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the instalments.

Ijarah financing represents arrangements whereby the Group (being the owner of assets) transfers its usufruct to its customers for an agreed period at an agreed consideration (rentals). Assets leased out under Ijarah are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. These are depreciated over the term of the lease. Ijarah income is recognised on an accrual basis.

Diminishing Musharakah is partnership agreement between the Group and its customer for long term financing of assets. The receivable is recorded to the extent of Group's share in the purchase of asset. Income is recognised on accrual basis.

Istisna is a sale contract where the Group places an order to the manufacturer / builders to produce certain assets and the sale is completed upon the delivery of the assets to the ultimate buyer.

Running Musharakah facility is to finance the working capital requirement of the customer whereas partnership is based on particular operations of the business.

# 4.15 Property and equipment

Property and equipment, other than land (which is not depreciated) and capital work-in-progress, are stated at cost or revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Land is carried at revalued amount less impairment losses while capital work-in-progress is stated at cost less impairment losses. The cost and the accumulated depreciation of property and equipment of overseas branches and subsidiaries include exchange differences arising on currency translation at the year-end rates of exchange.

Depreciation is calculated so as to write-off the depreciable amount of the assets over their expected useful lives at the rates specified in note 10.2 to these consolidated financial statements. The depreciation charge for the year is calculated on a straight line basis after taking into account the residual value, if any. The residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.

Depreciation on additions is charged from the month the asset is available for use. No depreciation is charged in the month of disposal.

Land and buildings are revalued by independent, professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. An increase arising on revaluation is credited to the surplus on revaluation of property and equipment account. A decrease arising on revaluation of property and equipment account is adjusted against the surplus of that asset or, if no surplus exists, is charged to the profit and loss account as an impairment of the asset. A surplus arising subsequently on an impaired asset is reversed through the profit and loss account up to the extent of the original impairment.

Surplus on revaluation of property and equipment (net of associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit.

Gains and losses on sale of property and equipment are included in the profit and loss account, except that the related surplus on revaluation of property and equipment (net of deferred tax) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

Major renewals and improvements that increase the useful life of an asset are capitalised and the assets so replaced, if any, are retired. Normal repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account as and when incurred.

# 4.16 Lease liability and Right-of-use asset

The Group enters into leasing arrangements for its branches, ATMs and warehouses. Rental contracts are typically for a fixed period and may have extension options as described below. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not be terminated).

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate.

The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The lease liability is also remeasured to reflect any reassessment or lease modification.

On initial recognition, right-of-use assets are measured at an amount equal to initial lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost model. The right of use asset is depreciated on a straight line method over the lease term as this method most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits. The right-of-use asset is reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The Group has elected to apply the practical expedient not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The lease payments associated with these leases is recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.

The amortisation charge for the year is calculated on a straight line basis after taking into account the residual value, if any. Amortisation on additions is charged from the month the asset is available for use. No amortisation is charged in the month of disposal.

Gains and losses on sale of intangible assets are included in the profit and loss account.

# 4.18 Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation. These assets are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. A surplus arising on revaluation of property is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets' account. A decrease arising on revaluation of non-banking asset is adjusted against the surplus of that asset or, if no surplus exists, is charged to the profit and loss account as an impairment of the asset. A surplus arising subsequently on an impaired asset is reversed through the profit and loss account up to the extent of the original impairment.

All direct costs of acquiring title to asset are charged to the profit and loss account. Gains and losses on sale of non-banking assets are included in the profit and loss account, except that the related surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets (net of deferred tax) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

# Deferred

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method on all major temporary differences between the amounts attributed to assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply to the period when the differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.

The Group also recognises deferred tax asset / liability on the deficit / surplus on revaluation of property and equipment / non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims and securities which is adjusted against the related deficit / surplus in accordance with the requirements of IAS 12, Income Taxes.

Provision for off balance sheet obligations is recognised when intimated and reasonable certainty exists that the Bank will be required to settle the obligation. The provision is charged to the profit and loss account net of expected recovery and the obligation is classified under other liabilities.

Provisions are reviewed at each statement of financial position date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.

* The Other Assets Especially Mentioned category pertains to agriculture and small enterprises financing.

** Not past due but impaired category mainly represents restructured exposures.

The FSV benefit availed is not available for the distribution of cash or stock dividend to shareholders.

These represent non-performing advances for agriculture financing which have been classified as loss, are fully provided and are in default for more than 3 years. These non-performing advances have been charged off by extinguishing them against the provision held in accordance with the SBP's Prudential Regulations for Agriculture Financing. This charge off does not, in any way, prejudice the Bank's right of recovery from these customers.

In 2007, the Bank was admitted to the official list of the UK Listing Authority and to the London Stock Exchange Professional Securities Market for trading of Global Depository Receipts (GDRs), each representing four ordinary shares issued by the Bank. The GDRs constitute an offering in the United States only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S Securities Act of 1933 and an offering outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S.

Holders of GDRs are entitled, subject to the provisions of the depository agreement, to receive dividends, if any, and rank pari passu with other equity shareholders in respect of such entitlement. However, the holders of GDRs have no voting rights or other direct rights of shareholders with respect to the ordinary shares underlying such GDRs. Subject to the terms and restrictions set out in the offering circular dated June 25, 2007, the deposited ordinary shares in respect of which the GDRs were issued may be withdrawn by the GDR holders from the depository facility. Upon withdrawal, the holders will rank pari passu with other ordinary shareholders in respect of voting powers. As at December 31, 2024 242,278 (2023: 242,278) GDRs, representing 969,112 (2023: 969,112) shares, are in issue.

# 25.3.1 Claims against the Group not acknowledged as debts

|Note|2024|2023|
|---|---|---|
|25.3.2|15,960,716|16,116,861|

These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Group from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security).

Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, management is confident that the matters will be decided in favour of the Group and the possibility of any outcome against the Group is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these consolidated financial statements.

This includes, penalties amounting to Rs. 4,089 million (2023: Rs.4,089 million) were levied by the FE Adjudication Court of the State Bank of Pakistan relating to alleged contraventions of the requirements of foreign exchange regulations with respect to issuance and certification of E-Forms by the Bank to certain customers (exporters) who failed to submit the export documents there against. Consequently, foreign exchange on account of export proceeds have not been repatriated. The Bank maintains that it fully discharged its liability, in accordance with the law and has filed a civil suit in the High Court of Sindh challenging the levy of the penalty. The High Court has granted a stay on action being taken against the Bank. The management, based on the advice from legal counsel, is confident that the view of the Bank will prevail and the Bank will not be exposed to any loss on this account.

Funding Policy

The Bank endeavours to ensure that liabilities under the various employee benefit schemes are covered by the Fund on any valuation date, based on various actuarial assumptions.

# 41.14

The significant risks associated with the staff retirement benefit schemes are as follows:

# Asset Volatility

The risk arises due to inclusion of risky assets in the funds portfolio, inflation, interest rate volatility and change in price.

# Changes in Bond Yields

The risk arises when bond yield is lower than the expected return on the planned assets (duration based PIB discount rate).

# Price Risk

The risk arises when there is volatility in market price of the equity instrument invested by Funds.

## Chunk 472


# Inflation Risk

The salary inflation is the major risk that the Gratuity and Compensated Absences liability carries. In pension fund the increase has been determined by the Supreme Court and does not carry this risk as the benefit is practically no longer exposed to future salary increases. Some of the post-retirement medical benefits are capped to a proportion of Pension, thus carrying no salary inflation risk. However, the hospitalisation benefit is susceptible to medical inflation risk.

# Other Risks

Though, not imminent and generally observable, over long term there are some risks that may crystallise. These include:

- Retention Risk – The risk that employee will not be motivated to continue the service or start working with the Bank if no market comparable retirement benefit is provided.
- Final Salary Risk – The risk, for defined benefit gratuity, that any disproportionate salary merit increases in later service years will give rise to a multiplicative increase in the gratuity liability as such increase is applicable to all the past years of service.
- Model Risk – The defined benefit gratuity liability is valued by actuary each year. Further, the assets in the Fund are also marked to market. This two-tier valuation gives rise to the model risk.
- Operational Risk related to a separate entity - Retirement benefits are funded through a separate trust fund which is a different legal entity than the Bank. Generally, the protocols, processes, and conventions used throughout the Bank are not applicable or are not actively applied to the retirement benefit Funds. This gives rise to some specific operational risks.
- Compliance Risk – The risk that retirement benefits offered by the Bank do not comply with minimum statutory requirements.
- Legal / Political Risk – The risk that the legal / political environment changes and as a result, the Bank is required to offer additional or different retirement benefits than what the Bank projected. Specifically, in the light of recent Supreme Court decisions, this risk has materialised.

# 41.15 UBL Fund Managers Limited

# 41.15.1 Principal actuarial assumptions

UBL FM operates an approved funded gratuity scheme for all its permanent employees. The benefits under the gratuity scheme are payable on retirement at the age of 60 years or earlier cessation of service in lump sum. The benefit is equal to one month's last drawn basic salary for each year of eligible service. The minimum qualifying eligible service for gratuity is 3 years for employees and executives. The latest actuarial valuation of the subsidiary's defined benefit plan, based on Projected Unit Credit Actuarial Cost Method, was carried out as at December 31, 2024. The main assumptions used in the actuarial valuation are as follows:

| |2024|2023|
|---|---|---|
|Discount rate|12.25%|15.50%|
|Expected rate of salary increase|20.00%|15.50%|

# 44. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The SBP through its BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 has prescribed the minimum paid-up capital (net of accumulated losses) for Banks to be raised to Rs.10,000 million by the year ending December 31, 2015. The paid-up capital of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2024 stood at Rs.12,241.797 million (2023: Rs.12,241.797 million) and is in compliance with SBP requirements. Banks are also required to maintain a minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 10.0% plus capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of the risk weighted exposures of the Bank.

In order to dampen the effects of COVID-19, the State Bank of Pakistan under BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020 has given a regulatory relief and reduced the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) as prescribed vide BPRD Circular No. 6 of August 15, 2013, for the time being, from its existing level of 2.5% to 1.5%, till further instructions.

Furthermore, under Basel III instructions, Banks are also required to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio and Tier 1 ratio of 6.0% and 7.5%, respectively, as at December 31, 2024. The Bank is fully compliant with prescribed ratios as the Bank’s CAR is 20.59 % whereas CET 1 and Tier 1 ratios stood at 14.83% and 15.45% respectively.

Furthermore, under the SBP’s Framework for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) introduced vide BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2018 dated April 13, 2018, UBL has been designated as a D-SIB under letter BSD-3/Bank/UBL/751777/2024 dated 31,034 August 29, 2024. In line with this framework, the Bank is required to meet the Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA) capital charge of 1.0%, in the form of Additional CET 1 capital, on a standalone as well as consolidated level. The prescribed HLA under D-SIB shall remain effective till the next D-SIB designation announcement is made by State Bank of Pakistan.

Under the current capital adequacy regulations, credit risk and market risk exposures are measured using the Standardised Approach and operational risk is measured using the Basic Indicator Approach. Credit risk mitigants are applied against the Bank’s exposures based on eligible collateral under comprehensive approach.

The Capital Adequacy Ratio excluding the transition benefit of ECL (net of tax) on adoption of IFRS 9 would be lower by 23 bps as at December 31, 2024.

# 49.2 Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of changes in market conditions that may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, following a negative impact on earnings. Market risk mainly arises from trading activities carried out by Treasury and Capital Market (TCM) like lending / borrowing, Investments and client facilitating activities.

To ensure effective management of Market Risk, a robust Risk Management Policy, which includes management of market risk, has been formulated and sanctioned by the Board of Directors. This policy delineates the appropriate risk metrics, control mechanisms, and methodologies employed for proactive market risk management.

The Bank carries out market risk management through effective risk measurement tools including Value at Risk (VaR), Price Value per Basis Point (PVBP), Duration, Beta, and Expected Shortfall on regular basis. Bank also ascertains the impact of changes in market factors on Bank’s earnings through regular stress testing and Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Processes (ICAAP).

# 49.2.4 Yield / Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) - Basel II Specific

Interest rate risk is the risk that fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in interest rates, including changes in the shape of yield curves. Interest rate risk is inherent in the overall business of the Bank and arises from mismatches between the contractual maturities and the re-pricing of on and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities. Interest rate risk is monitored and managed by performing periodic gap analysis, sensitivity analysis and stress testing. In case of any distressed event the results and corresponding action plan is presented at the relevant management / BoD committee.

# Operational risk

Operational risk is recognized as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.

In compliance with the Regulatory Guidelines, an Operational Risk Division is established within Risk & Credit Policy Group. Operational Risk Division is primarily responsible for the oversight of operational risk management across the Bank including International locations. The implementation of operational risk management framework is supported by operational risk management system and designated operational risk coordinators within different units across the Bank. The framework is in line with regulatory guidelines, international best practices, flexible enough to implement in stages and permits the overall approach to evolve in response to organizational learning and future requirements.

In accordance with the Operational Risk framework, a database covering losses, control breaches and near misses is being maintained by the division. Major risk events are analysed from the control breach perspective and mitigating controls are assessed on design and operating effectiveness. Quarterly updates on Operational Risk events are being presented to the Senior Management and Board Risk & Compliance Committee of the Bank. Periodic workshops are conducted for Risk & Control Self-Assessment and key risk exposures are identified and assessed against existing controls to evaluate improvement opportunities. Key Risk Indicators are also defined for monitoring of risk exposures. New products, systems, activities and processes, are subject to comprehensive operational risk assessments, before implementation.

Business Continuity Plans have been implemented across the Bank, clearly defining the roles and responsibilities of respective stakeholders, and covering recovery strategy, IT and structural backups, scenario and impact analyses and testing directives. Business Continuity Plans (BCP) for respective areas are in place and tested under domain of Operations Group.

# Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that a bank, though solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet all its obligations and commitments as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive costs.

UBL actively manages the risk through a set of qualitative and quantitative risk management techniques. The Global Assets and Liabilities Management Committee (GALCO) of the Bank is responsible for the oversight of liquidity management and meets at least on a monthly basis or more frequently, if required. A centralized approach is adopted, based on an integrated framework incorporating an assessment of all material known and expected cash flows and the availability of collateral which could be used to secure additional funding if required. The framework entails careful monitoring and control of the daily liquidity position, and regular liquidity stress testing under a variety of scenarios. These encompass both normal and stressed market conditions, including general market crises and the possibility that access to markets could be impacted by a stress event affecting some part of the Bank’s business.

It is the policy to maintain adequate liquidity at all times, in order to meet all obligations, repay depositors and fulfill commitments to lend under both normal and stressed conditions.

# Maturities of assets and liabilities - based on expected maturities of the assets and liabilities of the Group

Assets and Liabilities having contractual maturity dates are bucketed as per their respective maturities. The maturity profile of non-contractual deposits and bills payable is estimated using an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average model based on historical data. The methodology and the assumptions used to derive the maturity profile of non-contractual liabilities has been approved by Global Asset and Liabilities Committee (GALCO).

# 49.5 Information Security Risk

Information security risk is the probability of exposure or loss resulting from a cyberattack or data breach on the Bank. It is the potential for unauthorised use, disruption, modification or destruction of information such incidents can violate privacy, disrupt business, damage assets and facilitate other crimes like frauds.

UBL has a dedicated Information Security Division, functioning within Risk and Credit Policy Group which manages information security risks to protect the technology and information assets by preventing, detecting and responding to threats, both internal and external.

Offensive security unit within the information security division manages Penetration Testing by simulating the real world hacking scenarios. This unit remains responsible for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information / cyber security management system through control design and controls validation, primarily in the domain of applications / network penetration testing, and also supporting the other domains of information security i.e. security monitoring and threat hunting.

Moreover, to overcome social engineering frauds, extensive awareness campaigns are launched to provide specific training and guidance on information security related matters such as phishing, identity theft, online transaction frauds, etc. through various mechanisms such as social media, website, email advisories, SMS, webinars, phishing simulation exercises, new joiner’s orientation, and targeted awareness sessions for executive leadership. These initiatives by Governance, Risk and Compliance Unit are focused on elevating level of awareness for both internal as well as external customers to better equip them to counter security challenges. This unit manages the security compliance efforts, risk management and the development and implementation of information security policies, procedures, guidelines and standards. Cyber & Infrastructure Security unit ensures that the IT Infrastructure function and services are resilient, secure, well-designed, accessible, and adaptable to the organisation's changing demands. This unit is responsible for the continuous improvement of information / cyber security architecture that protects against both internal and external threats.

Significant progress has been made in securing the international territories as well by deploying 24/7 Security Operation Center (SOC) at UBL. This unit deals with security issues. The unit continuously shares awareness news, alerts, announcements, advisories and threats intelligence research reports to relevant stakeholder for securing the bank’s assets.

Application Security in Information Security (IS) manages IS Risk Analysis on software applications, APIs, Mobile Apps, Digital Channels, Cloud Computing, ATM including review of security aspects of assets, enterprise architecture design controls of the Applications in accordance with applicable policies, standards & controls.

Further, The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) program was initiated which aims to enhance security for customer card data by setting guidelines for any company that accepts, stores, processes, or transmits card information. This compliance framework is an industry-mandated set of standards intended to keep customer card data safe when it is used by merchants and service providers.

Moving ahead, Bank’s main focus remains on the continuous improvement of UBL’s security posture and to effectively prevent, monitor and rapidly respond to emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

# 49.6 Financial Crime Compliance (FCC) risk management and Pakistan FATF & APG action plan

The Bank monitors key risks on an ongoing basis to strengthen risk management in an effort to meet challenges emanating from a volatile market environment and the complexity driven by the changing Regulatory frameworks. By utilising comprehensive risk management processes and sophisticated control systems, the Bank aims to minimise the negative impact that may arise from varied degrees of risk exposures.

In response to changing landscape around FCC risks across the globe and in response to Financial Action Task Force (FATF) & Asia Pacific Group (APG) action plan and State Bank of Pakistan's Anti-Money Laundering, Combatting the Financing of Terrorism & Countering Proliferation Financing (AML / CFT / CPF) Regulations, the Bank embarked upon a comprehensive Financial Crime Compliance Transformation Program under the guidance of Board of Directors (BOD), specifically geared towards uplifting FCC Framework and fortifying controls across Process, People and Technology (Regtech) work streams in line with international best practices and Standards. Targeted investments were done across these work streams, brief highlights are as under:

1. Under FCC Process Workstream; the Bank uplifted the framework at Design level with key deliverables as:
- FCC Strategy
- Bank’s FCC Risk Appetite Statement
- Target Operating Model (TOM) across three lines of defense
- FCC Policies & Standards
- Enterprise Wide FCC Risk Assessment Methodologies/Internal Risk Assessment Review (EWRA/IRAR) with focus on AML, CFT, Sanctions / CPF & Transnational Risks etc.
- Management Information (MI) Suite.
2. The Bank rolled out comprehensive Role based FCC training modules and Staff capacity assessment carried out under FCC Transformation People Workstream.
3. On Regtech work stream, the Bank upgraded and implemented best in class Transaction Monitoring (TM) and payments screening systems. These systems were independently reviewed by a reputed international third party expert.
4. Effective risk governance sets a solid foundation for comprehensive risk management discipline. The Bank’s risk governance framework is based on “three line of defense” governance model, wherein each line has a specific role with defined responsibilities and work in close collaboration to identify, assess and mitigate risks. Key management and board committee covering FCC and compliance matters is Compliance Committee of Management (CCM) and Board Risk & Compliance Committee (BRCC).

Moreover, FCC Transformation & Controls Fortification Programme is an ongoing initiative that is managed by Compliance Governance team in consultation with FCC teams across first and second line of defence.

# 49.7 Derivative Risk

# Credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk of non-performance or default by a party to a derivatives transaction, resulting in an adverse impact on the Bank’s profitability. Credit risk associated with derivatives transactions is categorised into settlement risk and pre-settlement risk. Credit proposals for derivatives transactions are approved by the Credit Committee. The credit exposure of each counterparty is estimated and monitored against approved counterparty limits by Treasury Middle Office (TMO) on a daily basis.

# Market risk

The Bank, as a policy, hedges back-to-back all options transactions. In addition, the Bank does not carry any exchange risk on its Cross Currency Swaps portfolio as it hedges the exposure in the interbank market. To manage the interest rate risk of Interest Rate Derivatives, the Bank has implemented various limits which are monitored and reported by TMO on a daily basis.

# Liquidity risk

Derivatives transactions, usually being non-funded in nature, do not carry a specific funding liquidity risk. The liquidity risk arises from the fact that in Pakistan, interest rate derivatives generally have a uni-directional demand, and no perfect hedge is available. The Bank mitigates its risk by limiting the portfolio in terms of tenor, notional and sensitivity limits, and can also hedge its risk by taking on and off balance sheet positions in the interbank market, where available.

# Operational risk

The staff involved in the trading, settlement and risk management of derivatives is carefully trained to deal with the complexities involved in the process. Adequate systems and controls are in place to carry out derivatives transactions smoothly. Each transaction is processed in accordance with the product program or a transaction memo, which contains detailed guidance on the accounting and operational aspects of the transaction to further mitigate operational risk. In addition, TMO and the Compliance and Control Department are assigned the responsibility of monitoring any deviation from policies and procedures. The Bank’s Audit and Inspection Group also reviews this function, with a regular review of systems, transactional processes, accounting practices and end-user roles and responsibilities.

The Bank uses FX and Derivatives module of Treasury System which provides an end-to-end valuation solution, supports the routine transactional process and provides analytical tools to measure various risk exposures, carry out stress tests and sensitivity analysis. TMO produces various reports on a periodic basis which are reviewed by senior management. These reports provide details of the derivatives business profile such as outstanding positions, profitability, risk exposures and the status of compliance with limits.

# 50. YEMEN OPERATIONS

Despite risky situation and continued operational losses the Bank has been striving to honor liabilities for past eight years. However, on account of several factors, including but not limited to fragile political and economic situation in Yemen, bankruptcy of CBY Sana'a, existence of two Central Banks (i.e. CBY Sana'a and CBY Aden), has resulted in illiquid market, which does not appears to be reversed in near future. It is no longer possible for the Bank to continue its operations in Yemen due to reasons not attributable to the Bank and caused by circumstances entirely beyond the Bank's control. Therefore, Bank has completely exited from Yemen. The Bank is cognizant of the associated risks arising out of its exit from Yemen.

|---|---|
|(b) For non-filers of income tax returns:|30.00%|

To enable UBL to make tax deduction on the amount of cash dividend @ 15.00% instead of 30.00%, all the shareholders whose names are not entered/appring into the Active Taxpayers List (ATL) provided on the website of the Federal Board of Revenue (“FBR”), despite the fact that they are filers, are advised to make sure that their names are entered/appring into ATL before the date of issuance of Dividend Warrants, otherwise tax on their cash dividend will be deducted @ 30.00%.

# 5. Additional Information

The Basel III Circular prescribes a mandatory loss absorption feature for Additional Tier I capital instruments pursuant to which the Proposed Sukuk Issuance or Proposed TFC Issuance, as the case may be, will, if directed by the SBP, be subject to mandatory conversion into ordinary shares of the Bank, on the occurrence of the following trigger events: (i) the CET 1 Trigger Event (described below); (ii) if directed by the SBP, the PONV Event (described below); or (iii) if directed by the SBP, failure by the Issuer to comply with the Non-Cumulative Feature or Lock-In Clause (as specified in paragraph (iii)(g) of Annexure 2 of the Basel III Circular). Accordingly, the Bank will be under an obligation to mandatorily convert the Sukuk or TFCs, as the case may be, on the occurrence of any of the aforementioned trigger events.

Note: The Basel III Circular can be accessed from http://www.sbp.org.pk/bprd/2013/Basel_III_instructions.pdf

To secure the Bank’s obligation to convert the Sukuks or TFCs, as the case may be, the Basel III Circular expressly requires that there should be no impediments (legal or other) to the conversion i.e. the Bank should have all prior authorizations (sufficient room in authorized capital etc.) including regulatory approvals to issue the common shares upon conversion. To the extent ordinary shares will be issued to the Sukuk holders or TFC holders, as the case may be, on a without rights basis at the time of conversion of the Sukuks or TFCs, as the case may be, the Bank is required to comply with Section 83(1)(b) of the Companies Act, 2017 which requires the Bank to obtain the approval of its shareholders and the SECP. Such approvals are, in terms of the Basel III Circular required to be procured before the issuance of the Sukuks or TFCs, as the case may be.

The shareholders are therefore requested to consider and give their approval by way of special resolution for the issuance otherwise than by way of rights of ordinary shares of the Bank upon conversion of the Proposed Sukuk Issuance or the Proposed TFC Issuance, as the case may be. The terms of conversion of the Proposed Sukuk Issuance or the Proposed TFC Issuance, as the case may be, are set out in more detail herein below:
