# 3.1 Changes in accounting policies and transition disclosures

# 3.1.1 Impact of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Bank has opted for modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening retained earnings and other reserves at the beginning of the current year without restating the comparative figures. For notes disclosures, the consequential amendments to IFRS 7 disclosures as a result of adoption of IFRS 9 have also only been applied to the current period. The comparative period notes disclosures repeat those disclosures made in the prior year. The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in the accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 also significantly amends other standards dealing with financial instruments such as IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.

# 3.1.3 Explanation of changes in classification of certain financial assets

The following explains how applying the new classification requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Bank as shown in the table above:

(A) Debt instruments previously classified as available for sale (AFS) but which fail the SPPI test. The Bank holds a portfolio of debt instruments that failed to meet the ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ (SPPI) requirement for amortised cost classification under IFRS 9. These instruments contain provisions that, in certain circumstances, can allow the issuer to defer interest payments, but which do not accrue additional interest. This clause breaches the criterion that interest payments should only be consideration for credit risk and the time value of money on the principal. As a result, available for sale instruments, which amounted to Rs. 1,864.988 million respectively, were classified as FVPL from the date of initial application.

(B) Investment in debt securities previously designated at fair value through profit or loss. The Bank holds investment of Rs. 78,956.749 million in a portfolio of debt securities which had previously been designated at fair value through profit or loss as the debt securities were managed on a fair value basis. As part of the transition to IFRS 9, these securities are part of an ‘other’ business model and so required to be classified as FVPL category under IFRS 9, instead of designated FVPL category under existing local regulations.

(C) Designation of equity instruments at FVOCI. The Bank has elected to irrevocably designate strategic investments of Rs. 720.004 million in unquoted securities as permitted under IFRS 9. These securities were previously classified as available for sale. The changes in fair value of such securities will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss when they are disposed of. The Bank has elected to irrevocably designate Rs. 9,611.924 million in listed securities as permitted under IFRS 9. These securities were previously classified as available for sale. The changes in fair value of such securities will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss when they are disposed of.

(E) Reclassification from retired categories with no change in measurement. In addition to the above, the following debt instruments have been reclassified to new categories under IFRS 9, as their previous categories under existing local regulations were ‘retired’, with no changes to their measurement basis: (i) Those previously classified as available for sale and now classified as measured at FVOCI; and (ii) Those previously classified as held to maturity and now classified as measured at amortised cost.

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The significant judgments made by management in applying its accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The financial risk management objectives and policies adopted by the Bank are consistent with those disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debts

|Note|------- (Rupees in '000) -------|
|---|---|
|24.3.2|16,444,035|

These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security). Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, management is confident that the matters will be decided in the Bank's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Bank is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 24.3.2

During 2016, penalties amounting to Rs. 4.089 billion were levied by the FE Adjudication Court of the State Bank of Pakistan relating to alleged contraventions of the requirements of foreign exchange regulations with respect to issuance and certification of E-Forms by the Bank to certain customers (exporters) who failed to submit the export documents there against. Consequently, foreign exchange on account of export proceeds have not been repatriated. The Bank maintains that it fully discharged its liability, in accordance with the law and has filed a civil suit in the High Court of Sindh challenging the levy of the penalty. The High Court has granted a stay on action being taken against the Bank. The management, based on the advice from legal counsel, is confident that the view of the Bank will prevail and the Bank will not be exposed to any loss on this account.

# 37. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to collect, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to collect are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 37.1

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Federal Government securities|The fair value of Federal Government securities is determined using the prices / rates available on Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) / Bloomberg.|
|Non-Government debt securities|The fair value of non-government debt securities is determined using the prices / rates from MUFAP.|
|Foreign debt securities|The fair value of foreign corporate and foreign government securities is determined using the rates from Bloomberg.|
|Mutual Fund units|The fair values of investments in mutual fund units are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of each business day.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions|The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.|
|Derivatives|The fair valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.|
|Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.|

The SBP through its BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 has prescribed the minimum paid-up capital (net of accumulated losses) for Banks to be raised to Rs.10,000 million by the year ending December 31, 2015. The paid-up capital of the Bank for the period ended March 31, 2024 stood at Rs.12,241.797 million (December 31, 2023: Rs.12,241.797 million) and is in compliance with SBP requirements. Banks are also required to maintain a minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 10.0% plus capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of the risk weighted exposures of the Bank.

In order to dampen the effects of COVID-19, the State Bank of Pakistan under BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020 has given a regulatory relief and reduced the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) as prescribed vide BPRD Circular No. 6 of August 15, 2013, for the time being, from its existing level of 2.5% to 1.5%, till further instructions.

Further, under Basel III instructions, Banks are also required to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio and Tier 1 ratio of 6.0% and 7.5%, respectively, as at March 31, 2024. The Bank is fully compliant with prescribed ratios as the Bank’s CAR is 17.45% whereas CET 1 and Tier 1 ratios stood at 12.34% and 13.15% respectively.

Furthermore, under the SBP’s Framework for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) introduced vide BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2019 dated April 13, 2019, UBL has been designated as a D-SIB under letter BSD-3/Bank/UBL/394468/2022 dated December 20, 2022. In line with this framework, the Bank is required to meet the Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA) capital charge of 0.5%, in the form of Additional CET 1 capital, on a standalone as well as consolidated level. The prescribed HLA under D-SIB shall remain effective till the next D-SIB designation announcement is made by State Bank of Pakistan.

The Capital Adequacy Ratio as at March 31, 2024 includes the impact arising on the adoption of IFRS 9 effective on January 01, 2024, that resulted in an increase of 54bps to the CAR of the Bank.

# YEMEN OPERATIONS

Despite risky situation and continued operational losses the Bank has been striving to honor liabilities for past eight years. However, on account of several factors, including but not limited to fragile political and economic situation in Yemen, bankruptcy of CBY Sana’a, existence of two Central Banks (i.e. CBY Sana’a and CBY Aden), has resulted in illiquid market, which does not appears to be reversed in near future.

It is no longer possible for the Bank to continue its operations in Yemen due to reasons not attributable to the Bank and caused by circumstances entirely beyond the Bank’s control. Therefore, Bank has completely exited from Yemen. The Bank is cognizant of the associated risks arising out of its exit from Yemen.

# 3.1 Changes in accounting policies and transition disclosures

# 3.1.1 Impact of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Bank has opted for modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening retained earnings and other reserves at the beginning of the current year without restating the comparative figures. For notes disclosures, the consequential amendments to IFRS 7 disclosures as a result of adoption of IFRS 9 have also only been applied to the current period. The comparative period notes disclosures repeat those disclosures made in the prior year. The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in the accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 also significantly amends other standards dealing with financial instruments such as IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.

# 3.1.3 The following explains how applying the new classification requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Bank as shown in the table above:

(A) Debt instruments previously classified as available for sale (AFS) but which fail the SPPI test. The Bank holds a portfolio of debt instruments that failed to meet the ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ (SPPI) requirement for amortised cost classification under IFRS 9. These instruments contain provisions that, in certain circumstances, can allow the issuer to defer interest payments, but which do not accrue additional interest. This clause breaches the criterion that interest payments should only be consideration for credit risk and the time value of money on the principal. As a result, available for sale instruments, which amounted to Rs. 1,864.988 million respectively, were classified as FVPL from the date of initial application.

(B) Investment in debt securities previously designated at fair value through profit or loss. The Bank holds investment of Rs. 78,956.749 million in a portfolio of debt securities which had previously been designated at fair value through profit or loss as the debt securities were managed on a fair value basis. As part of the transition to IFRS 9, these securities are part of an ‘other’ business model and so required to be classified as FVPL category under IFRS 9, instead of designated FVPL category under existing local regulations.

In addition to the above, the following debt instruments have been reclassified to new categories under IFRS 9, as their previous categories under existing local regulations were ‘retired’, with no changes to their measurement basis:

- (i) Those previously classified as available for sale and now classified as measured at FVOCI; and
- (ii) Those previously classified as held to maturity and now classified as measured at amortised cost.

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.

# 24.3.1 Claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debts

16,444,035

These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security). Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, management is confident that the matters will be decided in the Bank's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Bank is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 24.3.2

During 2016, penalties amounting to Rs. 4,089 million were levied by the FE Adjudication Court of the State Bank of Pakistan relating to alleged contraventions of the requirements of foreign exchange regulations with respect to issuance and certification of E-Forms by the Bank to certain customers (exporters) who failed to submit the export documents there against. Consequently, foreign exchange on account of export proceeds have not been repatriated. The Bank maintains that it fully discharged its liability, in accordance with the law and has filed a civil suit in the High Court of Sindh challenging the levy of the penalty. The High Court has granted a stay on action being taken against the Bank. The management, based on the advice from legal counsel, is confident that the view of the Bank will prevail and the Bank will not be exposed to any loss on this account.

# 24.3.3

# 37. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified under held to collect, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified under held to collect model are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 37.1

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Federal Government securities|The fair value of Federal Government securities is determined using the prices / rates available on Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) / Bloomberg.|
|Non-Government debt securities|The fair value of non-government debt securities is determined using the prices / rates from MUFAP.|
|Foreign debt securities|The fair value of foreign corporate and foreign government securities is determined using the rates from Bloomberg.|
|Mutual Fund units|The fair values of investments in mutual fund units are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of each business day.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions|The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.|
|Derivatives|The fair valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.|
|Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.|

The SBP through its BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 has prescribed the minimum paid-up capital (net of accumulated losses) for Banks to be raised to Rs.10,000 million by the year ending December 31, 2015. The paid-up capital of the Bank for the three months ended March 31, 2024 stood at Rs.12,241.797 million (December 31, 2023: Rs.12,241.797 million) and is in compliance with SBP requirements. Banks are also required to maintain a minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 10.0% plus capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of the risk weighted exposures of the Bank.

In order to dampen the effects of COVID-19, the State Bank of Pakistan under BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020 has given a regulatory relief and reduced the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) as prescribed vide BPRD Circular No. 6 of August 15, 2013, for the time being, from its existing level of 2.5% to 1.5%, till further instructions.

Further, under Basel III instructions, Banks are also required to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio and Tier 1 ratio of 6.0% and 7.5%, respectively, as at March 31, 2024. The Bank is fully compliant with prescribed ratios as the Bank’s CAR is 15.24% whereas CET 1 and Tier 1 ratios stood at 10.91% and 11.53% respectively.

Furthermore, under the SBP’s Framework for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) introduced vide BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2019 dated April 13, 2019, UBL has been designated as a D-SIB under letter BSD-3/Bank/UBL/394468/2022 dated December 20, 2022. In line with this framework, the Bank is required to meet the Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA) capital charge of 0.5%, in the form of Additional CET 1 capital, on a standalone as well as consolidated level. The prescribed HLA under D-SIB shall remain effective till the next D-SIB designation announcement is made by State Bank of Pakistan.

The Capital Adequacy Ratio as at March 31, 2024 includes the impact arising on the adoption of IFRS 9 effective on January 01, 2024, that resulted in an increase of 40bps to the Consolidated CAR of the Bank.

# YEMEN OPERATIONS

Despite risky situation and continued operational losses the Bank has been striving to honor liabilities for past eight years. However, on account of several factors, including but not limited to fragile political and economic situation in Yemen, bankruptcy of CBY Sana’a, existence of two Central Banks (i.e. CBY Sana’a and CBY Aden), has resulted in illiquid market, which does not appears to be reversed in near future. It is no longer possible for the Bank to continue its operations in Yemen due to reasons not attributable to the Bank and caused by circumstances entirely beyond the Bank’s control. Therefore, Bank has completely exited from Yemen. The Bank is cognizant of the associated risks arising out of its exit from Yemen.
