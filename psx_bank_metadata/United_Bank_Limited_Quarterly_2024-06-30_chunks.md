# Performance Overview

UBL recorded an unconsolidated Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 57.7 billion for the half year ended June 30, 2024, representing a 14% year on year growth. Profit After Tax (PAT) stood at Rs. 29.4 billion for H1’24, compared to Rs. 26.3 billion in H1’23 with Earnings per share (EPS) of Rs. 24.05 compared to Rs. 21.50 for the corresponding period last year.

UBL reported consolidated PAT of Rs. 31.4 billion (H1’23: Rs. 27.5 billion) with consolidated EPS of Rs. 25.15 (H1’23: Rs. 22.01).

The Board of Directors of UBL declared an interim cash dividend of Rs. 11.0 per share in their meeting in Islamabad held on July 31, 2024, along with the results for the half year ended June 30, 2024.

Net mark-up income stood at Rs. 53.6 billion, while non-mark-up income was recorded at Rs. 38.7 billion in H1’24, with overall gross revenues at Rs. 92.3 billion for H1’24, an increase of 9% over H1’23.

Fee-based revenues maintained the overall business momentum with a 15% increase over the same period last year. Domestic current deposits averaged close to Rs. 1 Trillion, increasing by 24% year on year, with enhanced focus on network sales and service levels.

The Bank’s operating expenses recorded a 20% increase over H1’23 to Rs. 35.8 billion, in line with high inflation levels. Staff costs stood at Rs. 14.5 billion, increasing by 23%, resulting from growth across branches and hiring mainly within front office functions. Property related expenses were recorded at Rs. 4.9 billion, up 9%.

The Bank recorded a net provision reversal of Rs. 2.4 billion for H1’24 versus a net provision charge of Rs. 3.0 billion in the same period last year.

# Capital Ratios - Consolidated

UBL remains well capitalized with adequate buffers over regulatory requirements. The consolidated CAR stood at 15.0% at Jun’24 (Dec’23: 14.6%), 3.0% over the minimum regulatory requirement of 12.0%. The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET-1) ratio stood at 10.8% at Jun’24 (Dec’23: 10.5%). Tier 1 Capital ratio was measured at 11.4% at Jun’24 (Dec’23: 11.1%).

The transaction for the sale of the Bank’s shareholding in United National Bank Limited (UNBL UK) was concluded subsequent to the reporting period date. The disposal of this investment would increase the Consolidated Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of the Bank by around 200 basis points.

# Report on Review of Unconsolidated Condensed Interim Financial Information

# Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position of United Bank Limited (the Bank) as at 30 June 2024, the related unconsolidated condensed interim profit and loss account, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated condensed interim cash flow statement, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of changes in equity, and notes to the financial information for the six-months period then ended (here-in-after referred to as the “interim financial information”). Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of this interim financial information in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the financial information based on our review. The figures of the unconsolidated condensed interim profit and loss account and unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income for the quarters ended 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023 have not been subject to limited scope review by us as we are only required to review the cumulative figures for the six-months period ended 30 June 2024.

## Chunk 10


# Scope of review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

# Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim financial information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor’s review report is Arslan Khalid.

The SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 2 dated February 09, 2023 specified the new format for interim financial statements of banking companies. The new format has revised the disclosure requirements of the Bank for the half year ended June 30, 2024 which has resulted in additional disclosures relating to IFRS 9 and reclassification of Lease liabilities and Right of use assets on the face of Statement of Financial Position out of Property and equipment and Other Liabilities, respectively in these financial statements.

# 3.2 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 (read with IFRS 9 application instructions issued by SBP) retrospectively with date of initial application as January 01, 2024, which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements. In terms of the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening unappropriated profit and other reserves at the beginning of the current period without restating the comparative figures. The impact on carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities is disclosed in Note 3.2.4.

# 3.2.1 Scope of IFRS 9 application

IFRS 9 has been applicable in several overseas jurisdictions at various effective dates starting from January 01, 2018. The requirements of this standard were already incorporated in the Bank’s financial statements for the jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted. The results of those overseas operations where IFRS 9 is not applicable will be directly incorporated in the Bank’s financial statements as per the respective country's regulations, for the year ending December 31, 2024. As per the SBP IFRS 9 application instructions, all overseas Jurisdictions will be subject to the IFRS 9 requirements from next financial year.

Upon implementation of IFRS 9, the Banking Industry sought certain technical clarifications from SBP and also identified practical difficulties in certain areas of implementation of IFRS 9, such as valuation of unquoted equity securities, fair valuation of concessional loans, recognition of interest income/expense on financial instruments, modification accounting of financial assets and expected credit loss on foreign currency balances with SBP. The SBP vide its Circular No.16 dated July 29, 2024 has allowed temporary extension in timeline for most of the above referred matters with directions to implement IFRS 9 requirements before the end of the financial year other than valuation of unquoted equity securities which is required to be implemented from next financial year. However, the Banking Industry will continue to engage SBP on remaining matters in the coming months to have more clarity on such areas. Accordingly, the Bank has continued to apply previous accounting practices in such areas for the purposes of preparation of these interim financial statements.

# 3.2.2 Significant differences from accounting policies applicable till 31 December 2023 before adoption of IFRS 9

# 3.2.2.1 Classification of financial assets

IFRS 9 introduced a new classification model for financial assets that is more principle-based than the previous requirements. Financial assets are classified according to their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business models under which they are held. Instruments will be classified either at amortised cost, the newly established measurement category fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). For equity investment that are not held for trading, an election is available to the Bank to classify these either though FVTPL or FVOCI. The previous accounting policies were based on instrument by instrument classification into Held for trading, Held to maturity and Available for Sale categories as disclosed in Note 4.3 to the annual financial statements of the Bank.

# 3.2.2.2 Impairment of debt investments and loans and advances

The new IFRS 9 impairment requirements eliminate the previous threshold for the recognition of credit losses, i.e., it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. Instead, an entity always accounts for ECLs, and updates the loss allowance for changes in these ECLs at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition. Consequently, the holder of the financial asset needs to take into account more timely and forward-looking information in order to provide users of financial statements with useful information about the ECLs on financial instruments that are in the scope of these impairment requirements. The previous impairment requirements were based solely on Prudential regulations of SBP as disclosed in Note 4.9 to the annual financial statements of the Bank.

# 3.2.2.3 Impairment of equity investments

Previously, investments classified as available for sale were required to be tested for impairment and if there is an objective evidence of impairment, impairment was required to be booked. Under IFRS 9 regime, no impairment is required against such investments which are carried at FVOCI as the gain or loss on remeasurement will permanently remain in OCI/Surplus on revaluation of Investments. The previous accounting policies are disclosed in Note 4.9 to the annual financial statements of the Bank.

# 3.2.3 Material accounting policies applicable from 01 January 2024 as a result of adoption of IFRS 9

# 3.2.3.1 Financial assets – initial recognition

Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value. When the transaction price of the instrument differs from the fair value at origination and the fair value is based on a valuation technique using only inputs observable in market transactions, the Bank recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value in profit and loss account. In those cases where fair value is based on models for which some of the inputs are not observable, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value is deferred and is only recognised in profit and loss account when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

# 3.2.3.3 Financial assets at amortised cost

The Bank classifies its financial assets at amortized cost only if both of the following conditions are met:

- The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows
- The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding

## Chunk 33


# a) Business model

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Bank's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Bank's Board/ Board Committees
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank’s assessment

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stresscase’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Bank's original expectations, the Bank does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.

## Chunk 34


# b) The SPPI test

As a second step of its classification process the Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial asset to identify whether they meet the SPPI test.

The assessment of SPPI aims to identify whether the contractual cash flows are ‘solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding’.

‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset. The most significant elements of 'interest' within a lending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest rate is set.

In contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than de minimis exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding. In such cases, the financial asset is required to be measured at FVTPL.

After initial measurement, these financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost.

# 3.2.3.4 Debt instruments at FVOCI

The Bank applies this new category under IFRS 9 when both of the following conditions are met:

- The instrument is held within a business model, the objective of which is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
- The contractual terms of the financial asset meet the SPPI test

FVOCI debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising due to changes in fair value recognised in OCI. Interest income at EIR and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account.

The ECLs for debt instruments measured at FVOCI do not reduce the carrying amount of these financial assets in the statement of financial position, which remains at fair value. Instead, an amount equal to the allowance that would arise if the assets were measured at amortised cost is recognised in OCI as an accumulated impairment amount, with a corresponding charge to profit and loss account. The accumulated loss recognised in OCI is recycled to the profit and loss account upon derecognition of the assets.

On derecognition, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in OCI are reclassified from OCI to profit and loss account.

# 3.2.3.5 Equity instruments at FVOCI

Upon initial recognition, the Bank elects to classify irrevocably some of its equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI when they meet the definition of 'Equity' under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable.

Gains and losses on these equity instruments are never recycled to profit and loss account. Dividends are recognised in profit and loss account when the right of the payment has been established, except when the Bank benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment.

# 3.2.3.6 Financial assets and financial liabilities at FVPL

Financial assets and financial liabilities in this category are those that are:

- held for trading, that is, they have been purchased or issued primarily for short-term profit-making through trading activities or form part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together, for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit taking, or
- not held for trading and have been either designated by management upon initial recognition, or mandatorily required to be measured at fair value

Financial assets are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in profit and loss account. Interest and dividend income or expense is recorded in net trading income according to the terms of the contract, or when the right to payment has been established.

# 3.2.3.7 Financial liabilities at amortised cost

Financial liabilities with a fixed maturity are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. These include Bills payable, Borrowings, Deposits and certain items within Other Liabilities.

# 3.2.3.8 Derecognition of financial assets

# 3.2.3.8.1 Derecognition due to substantial modification of terms and conditions

The Bank derecognises a financial asset, such as a loan to a customer, when the terms and conditions have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new loan, with the difference recognised as a derecognition gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The newly recognised loan is classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes, unless it is deemed to be purchased originated credit impaired. When assessing whether or not to derecognise a loan to a customer, amongst others, the Bank considers qualitative factors such as change in currency of the loan, introduction of an equity feature, change in counterparty, or if the modification is such that the instrument would no longer meet the SPPI criterion.

If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different, the modification does not result in derecognition. Based on the change in cash flows discounted at the original EIR, the Bank records a modification gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded.

The gain/(loss) on derecognition of financial asset has been calculated as the difference between the book value (including impairment) and the proceeds received.

# 3.2.3.10 Impairment of financial assets

# 3.2.3.10.1 Overview of the ECL principles

The adoption of IFRS 9 has fundamentally changed the Bank’s loan loss impairment method by replacing the incurred loss approach of the local regulations with a forward-looking ECL approach. The Bank has been recording the allowance for expected credit losses for all loans and other debt financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI, together with loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantee contracts. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under IFRS 9. Under the SBP's instructions, local currency credit exposures guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL.

# 3.2.3.10.2 The calculation of ECLs

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss (LTECL)), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its financial assets into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

- Stage 1: When loans are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 loans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 2.
- Stage 2: When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination (SICR), the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 3.
- Stage 3: Loans considered credit-impaired. The Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs with PD set at 100%. Under SBP's instructions, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, Stage 3 allowance would be taken as the higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under Prudential Regulations.

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for the subject borrower. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. However, for certain portfolios, the Bank has rebutted the 30 DPD presumption based on behavioural analysis of its borrowers.

The key elements of ECL calculations are as follows:

- The Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the last 7 years. PDs for Non-rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward-looking information.
- The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.
- The Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in various forms, such as cash, securities, letters of credit/guarantees, real estate, receivables, inventories and other non-financial assets. For IFRS 9, the Bank only considers the liquid collaterals.

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UN-AUDITED)

# FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

The interest rate used to discount the ECLs would be based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities.

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three probability-weighted scenarios (a base case, a best case, and a worse case). Each of these is associated with different PDs, EADs and LGDs. These expected probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. This calculation is made for each of the three scenarios. When relevant, the assessment of multiple scenarios also incorporates how defaulted loans are expected to be recovered, including the probability that the loans will cure and the value of collateral or the amount that might be received for selling the asset.

The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has the legal right to call it earlier.

Impairment losses and reversals are accounted for and disclosed separately from modification losses or gains that are accounted for as an adjustment of the financial asset’s gross carrying value.

# 3.2.4 Transition disclosures

This note sets out the impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the statement of financial position, unappropriated profit and surplus on revaluation of investments.

The following table reconciles the carrying amounts of financial assets, from their previous measurement category in accordance with Prudential Regulations to their new measurement categories upon transition to IFRS 9 on January 01, 2024:

The following explains how applying the new classification requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Bank as shown in the table above:

(A) Debt instruments previously classified as available for sale (AFS) but which fail the SPPI test

The Bank held a portfolio of debt instruments amounting to Rs. 1,864.973 million that failed to meet the SPPI requirement for amortised cost classification under IFRS 9. These instruments contain provisions that, in certain circumstances, can allow the issuer to defer interest payments, but which do not accrue additional interest. This clause breaches the criterion that interest payments should only be consideration for credit risk and the time value of money on the principal. As a result these are required to be classified as FVTPL under IFRS 9.

(B) Designation of equity instruments at FVOCI

The Bank has elected to irrevocably designate investments in listed securities and strategic investments in unquoted securities as FVOCI amounting to Rs. 9,611.924 million and Rs. 720.004 million, respectively. These securities were previously classified as available for sale. The changes in fair value of such securities will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss when they are disposed of.

(C) Reclassification from retired categories with no change in measurement

In addition to the above, the following debt instruments have been reclassified to new categories under IFRS 9, as their previous categories under existing local regulations were ‘retired’, with no changes to their measurement basis:

(i) Those previously classified as available for sale and now classified as measured at FVOCI; and

(ii) Those previously classified as held to maturity and now classified as measured at amortised cost.

(iii) Those previously classified as held for trading and now classified as measured at FVTPL.

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The significant judgments made by management in applying its accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for the adoption of IFRS 9 w.e.f January 01, 2024. These are disclosed in Note 4.1

# 4.1 Impairment losses on financial assets

Determination of expected credit losses is a significant estimate and involves the following judgments:

- Development of ECL models, including the various formulas and the choice of inputs
- The segmentation of financial assets when their ECL is assessed on a collective basis
- The Bank’s internal credit grading model based on which PDs are assigned to the individual grades
- Qualitative and quantitative indicators used as SICR triggers
- The definition of default against which parameters of ECL model such as PD, LGD and EAD are evaluated
- Selection of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weightings
- Determination of economic inputs, such as GDP growth and CPI

# 5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The financial risk management objectives and policies adopted by the Bank are consistent with those disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# 24.3 Other contingent liabilities

# 24.3.1 Claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debts

These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security). Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, management is confident that the matters will be decided in the Bank's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Bank is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 24.3.2

During 2016, penalties amounting to Rs. 4.089 billion were levied by the FE Adjudication Court of the State Bank of Pakistan relating to alleged contraventions of the requirements of foreign exchange regulations with respect to issuance and certification of E-Forms by the Bank to certain customers (exporters) who failed to submit the export documents there against. Consequently, foreign exchange on account of export proceeds have not been repatriated. The Bank maintains that it fully discharged its liability, in accordance with the law and has filed a civil suit in the High Court of Sindh challenging the levy of the penalty. The High Court has granted a stay on action being taken against the Bank. The management, based on the advice from legal counsel, is confident that the view of the Bank will prevail and the Bank will not be exposed to any loss on this account.

# 36.1.1 Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2 and level 3.

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Federal Government securities|The fair value of Federal Government securities is determined using the prices / rates available on Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) / Bloomberg.|
|Non-Government debt securities|The fair value of non-government debt securities is determined using the prices / rates from MUFAP.|
|Foreign debt securities|The fair value of foreign corporate and foreign government securities is determined using the rates from Bloomberg.|
|Mutual Fund units|The fair values of investments in mutual fund units are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of each business day.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions|The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.|
|Derivatives|The fair valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.|
|Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.|

The SBP through its BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 has prescribed the minimum paid-up capital (net of accumulated losses) for Banks to be raised to Rs.10,000 million by the year ending December 31, 2015. The paid-up capital of the Bank for the period ended June 30, 2024 stood at Rs.12,241.797 million (December 31, 2023: Rs.12,241.797 million) and is in compliance with SBP requirements. Banks are also required to maintain a minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 10.0% plus capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of the risk weighted exposures of the Bank.

Furthermore, under the SBP’s Framework for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) introduced vide BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2019 dated April 13, 2019, UBL has been designated as a D-SIB under letter BSD-3/Bank/UBL/394468/2022 dated December 20, 2022. In line with this framework, the Bank is required to meet the Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA) capital charge of 0.5%, in the form of Additional CET 1 capital, on a standalone as well as consolidated level. The prescribed HLA under D-SIB shall remain effective till the next D-SIB designation announcement is made by State Bank of Pakistan.

Separate pool(s) are created where the customers desire to invest in high yield assets. These pool(s) rates are higher than the general pool depending on the assets. In case of loss in special pool, the loss will be borne by the special pool members. The net return on the pool is arrived at after deduction of direct costs from the gross return earned on the pool. From the net return, profit is paid to the Mudarib in the ratio of the Mudarib’s equity in the pool to the total pool. The balance represents the distributable profit.

# YEMEN OPERATIONS

Despite risky situation and continued operational losses the Bank has been striving to honor liabilities. However, on account of several factors, including but not limited to fragile political and economic situation in Yemen, bankruptcy of CBY Sana’a, existence of two Central Banks (i.e. CBY Sana’a and CBY Aden), has resulted in illiquid market, which does not appears to be reversed in near future.

It is no longer possible for the Bank to continue its operations in Yemen due to reasons not attributable to the Bank and caused by circumstances entirely beyond the Bank’s control. Therefore, Bank has completely exited from Yemen. The Bank is cognizant of the associated risks arising out of its exit from Yemen.

# 3.1 Changes in reporting format

The SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 2 dated February 09, 2023 specified the new format for interim financial statements of banking companies. The new format has revised the disclosure requirements of the Bank for the half year ended June 30, 2024 which has resulted in additional disclosures relating to IFRS 9 and reclassification of Lease liabilities and Right of use assets on the face of Statement of Financial Position out of Property and equipment and Other Liabilities, respectively in these financial statements.

# 3.2 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 (read with IFRS 9 application instructions issued by SBP) retrospectively with date of initial application as January 01, 2024, which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements. In terms of the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening unappropriated profit and other reserves at the beginning of the current period without restating the comparative figures. The impact on carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities is disclosed in Note 3.2.4.

# 3.2.1 Scope of IFRS 9 application

IFRS 9 has been applicable in several overseas jurisdictions at various effective dates starting from January 01, 2018. The requirements of this standard were already incorporated in the Bank’s financial statements for the jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted. The results of those overseas operations where IFRS 9 is not applicable will be directly incorporated in the Bank’s financial statements as per the respective country's regulations, for the year ending December 31, 2024. As per the SBP IFRS 9 application instructions, all overseas Jurisdictions will be subject to the IFRS 9 requirements from next financial year.

Upon implementation of IFRS 9, the Banking Industry sought certain technical clarifications from SBP and also identified practical difficulties in certain areas of implementation of IFRS 9, such as valuation of unquoted equity securities, fair valuation of concessional loans, recognition of interest income/expense on financial instruments, modification accounting of financial assets and expected credit loss on foreign currency balances with SBP. The SBP vide its Circular No.16 dated July 29, 2024 has allowed temporary extension in timeline for most of the above referred matters with directions to implement IFRS 9 requirements before the end of the financial year other than valuation of unquoted equity securities which is required to be implemented from next financial year. However, the Banking Industry will continue to engage SBP on remaining matters in the coming months to have more clarity on such areas. Accordingly, the Bank has continued to apply previous accounting practices in such areas for the purposes of preparation of these interim financial statements.

# 3.2.2 Significant differences from accounting policies applicable till 31 December 2023 before adoption of IFRS 9

# 3.2.2.1 Classification of financial assets

IFRS 9 introduced a new classification model for financial assets that is more principles-based than the previous requirements. Financial assets are classified according to their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business models under which they are held. Instruments will be classified either at amortised cost, the newly established measurement category fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). For equity investment that are not held for trading, an election is available to the Bank to classify these either through FVTPL or FVOCI. The previous accounting policies were based on instrument by instrument classification into Held for trading, Held to maturity and Available for Sale categories as disclosed in Note 4.4 to the annual financial statements of the Bank.

# 3.2.2.2 Impairment of debt investments and loans and advances

The new IFRS 9 impairment requirements eliminate the previous threshold for the recognition of credit losses, i.e., it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. Instead, an entity always accounts for ECLs, and updates the loss allowance for changes in these ECLs at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition. Consequently, the holder of the financial asset needs to take into account more timely and forward-looking information in order to provide users of financial statements with useful information about the ECLs on financial instruments that are in the scope of these impairment requirements. The previous impairment requirements were based solely on Prudential regulations of SBP as disclosed in Note 4.10 to the annual financial statements of the Bank.

# 3.2.2.3 Impairment of equity investments

Previously, investments classified as available for sale were required to be tested for impairment and if there is an objective evidence of impairment, impairment was required to be booked. Under IFRS 9 regime, no impairment is required against such investments which are carried at FVOCI as the gain or loss on remeasurement will remain in OCI/Surplus on revaluation of Investments. The previous accounting policies are disclosed in Note 4.10 to the annual financial statements of the Bank.

# 3.2.3.1 Financial assets – initial recognition

Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value. When the transaction price of the instrument differs from the fair value at origination and the fair value is based on a valuation technique using only inputs observable in market transactions, the Bank recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value in profit and loss account. In those cases where fair value is based on models for which some of the inputs are not observable, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value is deferred and is only recognised in profit and loss account when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

# 3.2.3.3 Financial assets at amortised cost

The Bank classifies its financial assets at amortized cost only if both of the following conditions are met:

- The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows
- The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding

The details of these conditions are outlined below:

# a) Business model assessment

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective. The Bank's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Bank's Board/Board Committees
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank’s assessment

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UN-AUDITED)

# FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Bank's original expectations, the Bank does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.

# b) The SPPI test

As a second step of its classification process the Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial asset to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. The assessment of SPPI aims to identify whether the contractual cash flows are ‘solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding’. ‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset. The most significant elements of 'interest' within a lending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest rate is set.

In contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than de minimis exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding. In such cases, the financial asset is required to be measured at FVTPL. After initial measurement, these financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost.

# 3.2.3.4 Debt instruments at FVOCI

The Bank applies this new category under IFRS 9 when both of the following conditions are met:

- The instrument is held within a business model, the objective of which is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
- The contractual terms of the financial asset meet the SPPI test

FVOCI debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising due to changes in fair value recognised in OCI. Interest income at EIR and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account. The ECLs for debt instruments measured at FVOCI do not reduce the carrying amount of these financial assets in the statement of financial position, which remains at fair value. Instead, an amount equal to the allowance that would arise if the assets were measured at amortised cost is recognised in OCI as an accumulated impairment amount, with a corresponding charge to profit and loss account. The accumulated loss recognised in OCI is recycled to the profit and loss account upon derecognition of the assets. On derecognition, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in OCI are reclassified from OCI to profit and loss account.

# 3.2.3.5 Equity instruments at FVOCI

Upon initial recognition, the Bank elects to classify irrevocably some of its equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI when they meet the definition of 'Equity' under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable. Gains and losses on these equity instruments are never recycled to profit and loss account. Dividends are recognised in profit and loss account when the right of the payment has been established, except when the Bank benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment.

# 3.2.3.6 Financial assets and financial liabilities at FVPL

Financial assets and financial liabilities in this category are those that are:

- held for trading, that is, they have been purchased or issued primarily for short-term profit-making through trading activities or form part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together, for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit taking, or
- not held for trading and have been either designated by management upon initial recognition, or mandatorily required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9

Financial assets are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in profit and loss account. Interest and dividend income or expense is recorded in net trading income according to the terms of the contract, or when the right to payment has been established.

# 3.2.3.7 Financial liabilities at amortised cost

Financial liabilities with a fixed maturity are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. These include Bills payable, Borrowings, Deposits and certain items within Other Liabilities.

# 3.2.3.8 Derecognition of financial assets

# 3.2.3.8.1 Derecognition due to substantial modification of terms and conditions

The Bank derecognises a financial asset, such as a loan to a customer, when the terms and conditions have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new loan, with the difference recognised as a derecognition gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The newly recognised loan is classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes, unless it is deemed to be purchased originated credit impaired. When assessing whether or not to derecognise a loan to a customer, amongst others, the Bank considers qualitative factors such as change in currency of the loan, introduction of an equity feature, change in counterparty, or if the modification is such that the instrument would no longer meet the SPPI criterion.

If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different, the modification does not result in derecognition. Based on the change in cash flows discounted at the original EIR, the Bank records a modification gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The gain/(loss) on derecognition of financial asset has been calculated as the difference between the book value (including impairment) and the proceeds received.

# 3.2.3.10 Impairment of financial assets

# 3.2.3.10.1 Overview of the ECL principles

The adoption of IFRS 9 has fundamentally changed the Bank’s loan loss impairment method by replacing the incurred loss approach of the local regulations with a forward-looking ECL approach. The Bank has been recording the allowance for expected credit losses for all loans and other debt financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI, together with loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantee contracts. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under IFRS 9. Under the SBP's instructions, local currency credit exposures guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL.

# 3.2.3.10.2 The calculation of ECLs

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss (LTECL)), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its financial assets into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

- Stage 1: When loans are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 loans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 2.
- Stage 2: When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination (SICR), the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 3.
- Stage 3: Loans considered credit-impaired. The Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs with PD set at 100%. Under SBP's instructions, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, Stage 3 allowance would be taken as the higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under Prudential Regulations.

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for the subject borrower. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. However, for certain portfolios, the Bank has rebutted the 30 DPD presumption based on behavioral analysis of its borrowers.

The key elements of ECL calculations are as follows:

- The Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the last 7 years. PDs for Non-rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward-looking information.
- The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.
- The Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in various forms, such as cash, securities, letters of credit/guarantees, real estate, receivables, inventories and other non-financial assets. For IFRS 9, the Bank only considers the liquid collaterals.

The interest rate used to discount the ECLs would be based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities.

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three probability-weighted scenarios (a base case, a best case, and a worse case). Each of these is associated with different PDs, EADs and LGDs. These expected probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. This calculation is made for each of the three scenarios. When relevant, the assessment of multiple scenarios also incorporates how defaulted loans are expected to be recovered, including the probability that the loans will cure and the value of collateral or the amount that might be received for selling the asset.

The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has the legal right to call it earlier. Impairment losses and reversals are accounted for and disclosed separately from modification losses or gains that are accounted for as an adjustment of the financial asset’s gross carrying value.

The following explains how applying the new classification requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Bank as shown in the table above:

## Chunk 165


# (A) Debt instruments previously classified as available for sale (AFS) but which fail the SPPI test

The Bank held a portfolio of debt instruments amounting to Rs. 1,864.973 million that failed to meet the SPPI requirement for amortised cost classification under IFRS 9. These instruments contain provisions that, in certain circumstances, can allow the issuer to defer interest payments, but which do not accrue additional interest. This clause breaches the criterion that interest payments should only be consideration for credit risk and the time value of money on the principal. As a result these are required to be classified as FVTPL under IFRS 9.

## Chunk 166


# (B) Designation of equity instruments at FVOCI

The Bank has elected to irrevocably designate investments in listed securities and strategic investments in unquoted securities as FVOCI amounting to Rs. 9,611.924 million and Rs. 720.004 million, respectively. These securities were previously classified as available for sale. The changes in fair value of such securities will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss when they are disposed of.

## Chunk 167


# (C) Reclassification from retired categories with no change in measurement

In addition to the above, the following debt instruments have been reclassified to new categories under IFRS 9, as their previous categories under existing local regulations were ‘retired’, with no changes to their measurement basis:

- Those previously classified as available for sale and now classified as measured at FVOCI;
- Those previously classified as held to maturity and now classified as measured at amortised cost;
- Those previously classified as held for trading and now classified as measured at FVTPL.

The impact of transition to IFRS 9 on unappropriated profit and surplus on revaluation of investments is as follows:

|Unappropriated profit|Surplus / (Deficit) on revaluation Investments|Total| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Balance as at December 31, 2023| | | |90,492,296|3,753,667|94,245,963|

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The significant judgments made by management in applying its accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for the adoption of IFRS 9 w.e.f January 01, 2024. These are disclosed in Note 4.1

## Chunk 169


# 4.1 Impairment losses on financial assets

Determination of expected credit losses is a significant estimate and involves the following judgments:

- Development of ECL models, including the various formulas and the choice of inputs
- The segmentation of financial assets when their ECL is assessed on a collective basis
- The Bank’s internal credit grading model based on which PDs are assigned to the individual grades
- Qualitative and quantitative indicators used as SICR triggers
- The definition of default against which parameters of ECL model such as PD, LGD and EAD are evaluated
- Selection of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weightings
- Determination of economic inputs, such as GDP growth and CPI

# 5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The financial risk management objectives and policies adopted by the Bank are consistent with those disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

|June 30, 2024|December 31,| | |
|24.3.1|Claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debts|16,222,810|16,116,861|

These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security). Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, management is confident that the matters will be decided in the Bank's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Bank is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

24.3.2 During 2016, penalties amounting to Rs. 4.089 billion were levied by the FE Adjudication Court of the State Bank of Pakistan relating to alleged contraventions of the requirements of foreign exchange regulations with respect to issuance and certification of E-Forms by the Bank to certain customers (exporters) who failed to submit the export documents there against. Consequently, foreign exchange on account of export proceeds have not been repatriated. The Bank maintains that it fully discharged its liability, in accordance with the law and has filed a civil suit in the High Court of Sindh challenging the levy of the penalty. The High Court has granted a stay on action being taken against the Bank. The management, based on the advice from legal counsel, is confident that the view of the Bank will prevail and the Bank will not be exposed to any loss on this account.

24.3.3 exposed to any loss on this account. For contingencies relating to taxation, refer note 22.1.

|36.|FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS| | | | |
| |The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified under held to collect, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified under held to collect model are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.| | | | |
| |The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.| | | | |
| |In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.| | | | |
|36.1|The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:| | | | |
| |Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.| | | | |
| |Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).| | | | |
| |Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).| | | | |

The SBP through its BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 has prescribed the minimum paid-up capital (net of accumulated losses) for Banks to be raised to Rs.10,000 million by the year ending December 31, 2015. The paid-up capital of the Bank for the six months ended June 30, 2024 stood at Rs.12,241.797 million (December 31, 2023: Rs.12,241.797 million) and is in compliance with SBP requirements. Banks are also required to maintain a minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 10.0% plus capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of the risk weighted exposures of the Bank.

In order to dampen the effects of COVID-19, the State Bank of Pakistan under BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020 has given a regulatory relief and reduced the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) as prescribed vide BPRD Circular No. 6 of August 15, 2013, for the time being, from its existing level of 2.5% to 1.5%, till further instructions.

Further, under Basel III instructions, Banks are also required to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio and Tier 1 ratio of 6.0% and 7.5%, respectively, as at June 30, 2024. The Bank is fully compliant with prescribed ratios as the Bank’s CAR is 15.03% whereas CET 1 and Tier 1 ratios stood at 10.77% and 11.38% respectively.

Furthermore, under the SBP’s Framework for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) introduced vide BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2019 dated April 13, 2019, UBL has been designated as a D-SIB under letter BSD-3/Bank/UBL/394468/2022 dated December 20, 2022. In line with this framework, the Bank is required to meet the Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA) capital charge of 0.5%, in the form of Additional CET 1 capital, on a standalone as well as consolidated level. The prescribed HLA under D-SIB shall remain effective till the next D-SIB designation announcement is made by State Bank of Pakistan.

The Consolidated Capital Adequacy Ratio excluding the transition benefit of ECL (net of tax) on adoption of IFRS 9 would be lower by 31bps as at June 30, 2024.

# YEMEN OPERATIONS

Despite risky situation and continued operational losses the Bank has been striving to honor liabilities. However, on account of several factors, including but not limited to fragile political and economic situation in Yemen, bankruptcy of CBY Sana’a, existence of two Central Banks (i.e. CBY Sana’a and CBY Aden), has resulted in illiquid market, which does not appears to be reversed in near future.

It is no longer possible for the Bank to continue its operations in Yemen due to reasons not attributable to the Bank and caused by circumstances entirely beyond the Bank’s control. Therefore, Bank has completely exited from Yemen. The Bank is cognizant of the associated risks arising out of its exit from Yemen.
