## Chunk 6

# Economic Review

The year 2024 commenced amidst a backdrop of mixed developments and uncertain expectations for economic recovery. Despite ongoing geopolitical conflicts and lingering supply chain disruptions from the pandemic, global economic activity demonstrated resilience. Central banks worldwide continued to implement high-interest-rate policies aimed at curbing inflation. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reflected this cautious outlook in its latest update. In the April 2024 World Economic Outlook, the IMF adjusted its projection for global growth in 2024 upward to 3.2%, a marginal increase of 0.1% from its earlier forecast in January 2024.

According to the IMF, Global headline inflation is expected to decrease from an annual average of 6.8% in 2023 to 5.9% in 2024. In contrast, domestic headline inflation is projected to be 24.8% for 2024, up by 1.2% from the previous projection in October WEO of the IMF.

Domestically, Pakistan is navigating a series of challenges including uncertain political climate, high inflation and weakened business confidence. Despite these difficulties, there are short-term signs of economic improvement. The IMF projects Pakistan’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.0% for 2024 and 3.5% for 2025. Similarly, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) anticipates GDP growth to remain in the range of 2% to 3% for 2024.

Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) showed a year-on-year increase of 1.8% in January 2024, which is a significant improvement compared to a decline of 5.6% observed in January 2023. During Jul-Jan FY’24, 12 out of 22 sectors recorded positive growth. These sectors include Food, Beverages, Apparel, Leather, Wood products, Coke & Petroleum Products, Chemicals, Pharmaceuticals, Rubber.

Pakistan’s total foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 13.4 billion at the end of March 2024, compared to US$ 9.2 billion at the end of March 2023 showing an increase of 46%. Whereas, reserves with SBP increased by 91% to US$ 8.0 billion at the end of March 2024 from US$ 4.2 billion at the end of March 2023.

# Allied Bank Limited

During Jul-Feb FY’24, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) amounted to US$ 820.6 million, showing a decrease of 17% compared to US$ 990.2 million in the same period last year. However, in February 2024, FDI witnessed a growth of 16% to record at US$ 131 million from US$ 113 million in the same month last year. Power sector attracted the highest FDI share of 30%, whereas Oil & Gas exploration and Financial Business sectors attracted 18% and 15% respectively of total FDI. Foreign Portfolio Investment recorded an inflow of US$ 111.7 million during Jul-Feb FY’24 as against an outflow of US$ 1,017.4 million in the same period last year.

Considering various developments on the political and economic fronts, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) experienced positive performance in February 2024. The benchmark KSE-100 index closed at 64,579 points on February 29, 2024. Additionally, the market capitalization of the PSX was recorded at Rs. 9.35 trillion in March 2024. Money supply (M2) stood at Rs. 33,739 billion at the end of March 2024, compared to Rs. 28,814 billion at the end of March 2023 depicting a growth of 17%. Currency in Circulation (CIC) was recorded at Rs. 8,651 billion by the end of March 2024 increased by 5% from Rs. 8,271 billion at the end of March 2023.

For March 2024, the National Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained at a 20.7% increase on a YoY basis, compared to a 23.1% increase in the previous month. On a MoM basis, it increased by 1.7% in March 2024, compared to no change observed in the previous month. Considering the moderate pickup in economic activity, along with the rebound in agriculture output, improvements in external account balance, a downward trend in inflation and modest trend in commodity prices, the monetary policy committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy rate at 22% in its recent meeting. However, despite the decline in inflation in February 2024, the level of inflation remains high and its outlook is still vulnerable.

# Director’s Review

# Future Outlook

Global growth is showing signs of improvement earlier than expected due to moderating risks. The IMF’s recent April 24 WEO projects global growth at 3.2% for 2025 and 3.1% for 2029. However, inflation for 2025 is expected to be 4.5%, slightly higher by 0.1% than the earlier projection of 4.4% in the IMF’s January 2024 outlook.

Despite a deceleration in domestic inflation in February 2024, the level of inflation remains high. Fully aware of this concern, the MPC has maintained its current stance with the aim of reducing inflation to the target range of 5-7% by September 2025.

# Entity Rating

Pakistan Credit Rating Agency (PACRA) maintained the Bank’s long-term and short-term credit rating at the highest level of “AAA” (Triple A) and “A1+” (A One Plus) respectively.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in preparing the audited annual unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for the adoption of the IFRS 9 Financial Instruments w.e.f January 01, 2024.

## Chunk 26

# 3.1 New Standards, Interpretations and amendments adopted by the Bank

# Impact of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Bank has opted for modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening retained earnings and other reserves at the beginning of the current year without restating the comparative.

For notes disclosures, the consequential amendments to IFRS 7 disclosures as a result of adoption of IFRS 9 have also only been applied to the current period. The comparative period notes disclosures repeat those disclosures made in the prior year.

The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in the accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 also significantly amends other standards dealing with financial instruments such as IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.

## Chunk 28

# 3.1.2 Impact on equity and regulatory capital on adoption of IFRS 9

The total estimated adjustment (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Bank’s equity as at January 01, 2024 is a reduction in equity of approximately Rs. 2,722.8 million, with corresponding impacts as follows:

- A decrease of Rs. 3,115.641 million net of tax related to impairment requirements;
- An increase of Rs. 392.841 million net of tax related to classification and measurement changes.

In order to mitigate the impact of ECL provisioning on capital, a transitional arrangement is allowed to the banks to absorb the impact on regulatory capital. Accordingly, banks which choose to apply this transitional arrangement may implement this in accordance with SBP’s Guideline for absorption of ECL for CAR purposes as mentioned in Annexure-B of BPRD Circular no. 3 of 2022.

The estimated impact of initial adoption of IFRS 9 on the Bank’s capital ratios, without accounting for the allowed transitional arrangement, is as follows:

- Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Adequacy Ratio - 19.74%
- Tier 1 Capital Adequacy Ratio - 19.74%
- Total Capital Adequacy Ratio - 26.18%

---

## Chunk 29

# 3.1.3

The following explains how applying the new classification requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Bank as shown in the table above:

- (a) Open ended mutual funds previously classified as available for sale (AFS) but which fail the SPPI test. The Bank holds a portfolio of mutual funds investments which was earlier classified as available for sale investments. However, these investments do not meet the definition of equity investment from holders perspective therefore IFRS 9 classification requirements of debt instruments have been applied to these.

---

## Chunk 30

# 1st Quarterly Report – March 2024

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements

# (Un-audited) for the three months period ended March 31, 2024

Financial assets. The business model of this portfolio is hold to collect and sell, however contractual cash flows failed to meet the ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ (SPPI) test requirement for classification as FVOCI under IFRS 9. Therefore, these financial assets having a carrying value of Rs. 34.454 million have been reclassified mandatorily as FVTPL.

---

## Chunk 31

# (b) Debt investments previously classified as available for sale (AFS) reclassified to amortized cost

At the date of initial application of IFRS 9, an entity shall assess the business model and the contractual terms of the financial asset on the basis of facts and circumstances that exist at the transition date. The Bank has identified certain portfolio of federal government securities under AFS category which have been held to collect the contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. As a result, financial assets having fair value amounting to Rs. 104,223.092 million have been reclassified to Amortized cost at Rs. 120,334.806 million, instead of FVOCI.

---

## Chunk 32

# (c) Investment in debt securities previously designated at held for trading

The Bank holds investment of Rs. 20,049.848 million in a portfolio of debt securities which had previously been designated at held for trading as the debt securities were managed on a fair value basis. As part of the transition to IFRS 9, these securities are part of an ‘other’ business model and so required to be classified as FVTPL category under IFRS 9, instead of designated FVTPL category under existing local regulations.

---

## Chunk 33

# (d) Designation of equity instruments at FVOCI

The Bank has elected to irrevocably designate equity investments of Rs. 18,798.989 million in listed and unquoted securities as permitted under IFRS 9. These securities were previously classified as available for sale. The changes in fair value of such securities will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss when they are disposed of.

---

## Chunk 34

# (e) Reclassification from retired categories with no change in measurement

In addition to the above, the following debt instruments have been reclassified to new categories under IFRS 9, as their previous categories under existing local regulations were ‘retired’, with no changes to their measurement basis:

- (i) Those previously classified as available for sale and now classified as measured at FVOCI; and
- (ii) Those previously classified as held to maturity and now classified as measured at amortised cost.

Several amendments apply for the first time in 2024, but do not have an impact on the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements of the Bank:

|Effective date|(periods beginning on or after)|
|---|---|
|IAS 1 - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and ‘Non-current Liabilities with Covenants - (Amendments)|January 01, 2024|
|IAS 7 and IFRS 7 - Disclosures: Supplier Finance Arrangements - Amendments|January 01, 2024|
|IFRS 16 - Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback - Amendments|January 01, 2024|

|IAS 21 - Lack of exchangeability - Amendments|January 01, 2025|

# 37 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# 37.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance Certificates and Forward Government & Exchange Contracts.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in preparing the audited annual unconsolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for the adoption of the IFRS 9 Financial Instruments w.e.f January 01, 2024.

## Chunk 111

# 3.1 New Standards, Interpretations and amendments adopted by the Group

# Impact of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group has opted for modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening retained earnings and other reserves at the beginning of the current year without restating the comparative. For notes disclosures, the consequential amendments to IFRS 7 disclosures as a result of adoption of IFRS 9 have also only been applied to the current period. The comparative period notes disclosures repeat those disclosures made in the prior year. The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in the accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 also significantly amends other standards dealing with financial instruments such as IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.

## Chunk 112

# 3.1.1 Reconciliation of statement of financial position balances from existing local regulations to IFRS 9

'The following table reconciles the carrying amount of financial assets from their previous measurement category in accordance with existing local regulations to their new measurement categories upon transition to IFRS 9 on January 01, 2024.

# (Un-audited) for the three months period ended March 31, 2024

# 3.1.2 Impact on equity and regulatory capital on adoption of IFRS 9

The total estimated adjustment (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Group's equity as at January 01, 2024 is a reduction in equity of approximately Rs. 2,722.8 million, with corresponding impacts as follows:

- A decrease of Rs. 3,115.641 million net of tax related to impairment requirements;
- An increase of Rs. 392.841 million net of tax related to classification and measurement changes.

In order to mitigate the impact of ECL provisioning on capital, a transitional arrangement is allowed to the Groups to absorb the impact on regulatory capital. Accordingly, Groups which choose to apply this transitional arrangement may implement this in accordance with SBP's Guideline for absorption of ECL for CAR purposes as mentioned in Annexure-B of BPRD Circular no. 3 of 2022.

The estimated impact of initial adoption of IFRS 9 on the Bank’s capital ratios, without accounting for the allowed transitional arrangement, is as follows:

- Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Adequacy Ratio - 19.74%
- Tier 1 Capital Adequacy Ratio - 19.74%
- Total Capital Adequacy Ratio - 26.18%

## Chunk 114

# 3.1.3 Changes in classification of certain financial assets

The following explains how applying the new classification requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Group as shown in the table above:

1. (a) Open ended mutual funds previously classified as available for sale (AFS) but which fail the SPPI test

The Group holds a portfolio of mutual funds investments which was earlier classified as available for sale investments. However, these investments do not meet the definition of equity investment from holders perspective therefore IFRS 9 classification requirements of debt instruments have been applied to these financial assets. The business model of this portfolio is hold to collect and sell, however contractual cash flows failed to meet the ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ (SPPI) test requirement for classification as FVOCI under IFRS 9. Therefore, these financial assets having a carrying value of Rs. 34.454 million have been reclassified mandatorily as FVTPL.
2. (b) Debt investments previously classified as available for sale (AFS) reclassified to amortized cost

At the date of initial application of IFRS 9, an entity shall assess the business model and the contractual terms of the financial asset on the basis of facts and circumstances that exist at the transition date. The Bank has identified certain portfolio of federal government securities under AFS category which have been held to collect the contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. As a result, financial assets having fair value amounting to Rs. 104,223.092 million have been reclassified to Amortized cost at Rs. 120,334.806 million, instead of FVOCI.
3. (c) Investment in debt securities previously designated at held for trading

The Group holds investment of Rs. 20,049.848 million in a portfolio of debt securities which had previously been designated at held for trading as the debt securities were managed on a fair value basis. As part of the transition to IFRS 9, these securities are part of an ‘other’ business model and so required to be classified as FVTPL category under IFRS 9, instead of designated FVTPL category under existing local regulations.
4. (d) Designation of equity instruments at FVOCI

The Group has elected to irrevocably designate equity investments of Rs. 18,798.989 million in listed and unquoted securities as permitted under IFRS 9. These securities were previously classified as available for sale. The changes in fair value of such securities will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss when they are disposed of.

# Allied Bank Limited

# Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements

# (Un-audited) for the three months period ended March 31, 2024

# (e) Reclassification from retired categories with no change in measurement

In addition to the above, the following debt instruments have been reclassified to new categories under IFRS 9, as their previous categories under existing local regulations were ‘retired’, with no changes to their measurement basis:

1. Those previously classified as available for sale and now classified as measured at FVOCI; and
2. Those previously classified as held to maturity and now classified as measured at amortised cost.

Several amendments apply for the first time in 2024, but do not have an impact on the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements of the Group:

|Effective date|(periods beginning on or after)|
|---|---|
|IAS 1 - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and ‘Non-current Liabilities with Covenants - (Amendments)|January 01, 2024|
|IAS 7 and IFRS 7 - Disclosures: Supplier Finance Arrangements - Amendments|January 01, 2024|
|IFRS 16 - Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback - Amendments|January 01, 2024|

---

## Chunk 116

# 3.2 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective

The following amendments to existing accounting standards will be effective from the dates mentioned below against the respective standard or amendment:

|Effective date|(periods beginning on or after)|
|---|---|
|IAS 21 - Lack of exchangeability - Amendments|January 01, 2025|
|IFRS 10 and IAS 28 - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor|Not yet announced|

The above mentioned amendments are not likely to have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.

|25.3.2|The income tax assessments of the Group have been finalized up to and including tax year 2023 for local, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan operations. While finalizing income tax assessments up to tax year 2023, income tax authorities made certain add backs with aggregate tax impact of Rs. 35,111 million (2023: Rs.34,866 million). As a result of appeals filed by the Group before appellate authorities, most of the add backs have been deleted. However, the Group and Tax Department are in appeals/references before higher forums against unfavorable decisions. Pending finalization of appeals/references no provision has been made by the Group on aggregate sum of Rs.35,111 million (2023: Rs.34,866 million). The management is confident that the outcome of these appeals/references will be in favor of the Group. Tax Authorities have conducted proceedings of withholding tax audit under section 161/205 of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for tax year 2003 to 2006 and tax year 2008 to 2018 and created an arbitrary demand of Rs.2,049 million (2023: Rs.2,049 million). The Group's appeals before CIR(A)/Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that these appeals will be decided in favor of the Group; therefore, no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs.2,049 million (2023: Rs.2,049 million). Tax authorities have also issued orders under Federal Excise Act, 2005/Sales Tax Act, 1990, Punjab Sales Tax on Services Act, 2012 and Sindh Sales Tax on Services Act, 2011 for the year 2008 to 2017 and 2021 thereby creating arbitrary aggregate demand of Rs.1,149 million (2023: Rs.1,144 million). The Group's appeals before CIR(A)/Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that aforesaid demand will be deleted by appellate authorities and therefore no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs.1,149 million (2023: Rs.1,144 million).| | |
|25.3.3|While adjudicating foreign exchange repatriation cases of exporter namely: Fateh Textile Mills Limited, the Foreign Exchange Adjudicating Court (FEAC) of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has arbitrarily adjudicated penalties against various banks including Rs.2,173 million in aggregate against Allied Bank Limited (the Bank). Against the said judgments, the Bank had filed appeals before the Appellate Board and Constitutional Petitions (CP) in the High Court of Sindh, Karachi. The Honorable High Court granted relief to the Bank by way of interim orders. Meanwhile, along with other banks, Bank filed a further CP whereby vires of section 23C of the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act, 1947 was sought to be declared ultra vires. On November 8, 2018, the Honorable court was pleased to order that the Appellate Board shall not finally decide the appeals. Subsequently, the earlier CP was disposed of vide order dated January 15, 2019 with a direction to the Appellate Board to first decide the stay application of the Bank and till then, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Department has been restrained from taking any coercive action against the Bank. Based on merits of the appeals, the management is confident that these appeals shall be decided in favor of the Bank and therefore no provision has been made against the impugned penalty.| | |
