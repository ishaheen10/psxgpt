# CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I present my first review report as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Askari Bank since assuming the role in April 2024.

I am pleased to inform our shareholders that Mr. Zia Ijaz has been appointed as President & CEO of Askari Bank Limited. I am confident that his leadership will be foundational for the growth and transformation of Askari Bank as a leading brand in the years ahead.

Looking back on 2024, Askari Bank delivered resilient operating performance. After a moderate first half of the year, management delivered a positive operating leverage during the second half with good revenue growth, cost discipline and improved efficiency. Net assets increased by 25 percent during the year and I am pleased to inform that the Board has recommended a dividend of 30 percent for the year for our shareholders.

In the broader economy, inflation and interest rates have declined sharply, encouraging fundamentals for sustainable growth. The year ahead requires careful and deliberate management to capitalize on the growing confidence for enhanced economic activity leading to greater stability.

The Board continued to take a long-term view of Askari Bank’s progress against strategic objectives while closely tracking the short-term performance. During the year, the Board maintained focus on liquidity and capital for an inclusive and sustainable value creation in an environment of elevated sectoral risks that needed to be stabilized to pave the way for normalcy and growth.

Strong governance is the Board’s top priority. The Board of Directors with its balanced representation of knowledge and experience has been assisted by dedicated Board committees that supervised specialized verticals with strategic insight enabled by an effective policy framework and terms of engagement. During the year, the Board and Board Committees remained actively engaged with the leadership team holding frequent in-depth reviews, providing prudent oversight and guidance on the strategies and progress, building resilience in both financial and non-financial dimensions of risk and compliance across the business lines.

The Board’s oversight is integral to the Bank’s delivery of enduring value for all stakeholders – clients, teams, communities and shareholders.

The global economic growth is moderating in a complex landscape as inflation and interest rates decline gradually. The growth trends vary amongst advanced economies; in the US, underlying demand remains robust, reflecting strong wealth effects, a less restrictive monetary policy, and supportive financial conditions; in Europe growth is expected to pick up but at a gradual pace as geopolitical tensions continue to weigh on sentiment. The developing economies are faced with headwinds due to high debt burdens, weak investment and productivity growth, rising geopolitical tensions and mounting dangers of climate change. Growth in developing economies is expected to remain lower and insufficient to foster progress necessary to alleviate poverty and achieve wider development goals, thus warranting domestic reforms to quicken private investment, deepen trade relations, and promote more efficient use of capital, talent and energy.

Pakistan’s economy continued its gradual recovery supported by global prices, monetary easing stable exchange rate, and upgrade in sovereign rating. GDP growth accelerated to 2.5 percent for the fiscal year 2024, and moderating for first quarter of the current fiscal year due to high base effect in agriculture. Inflation has been on a downturn since the beginning of the year, CPI dropped sharply from 29.7 to 4.1 percent during 2024, primarily driven by declining food inflation, favourable global commodity prices and high base effect. The pace of disinflation, fiscal and external sector stability and improving indicators prompted sharp reduction in SBP policy rate from 22 to 13 percent during the year in review, leading to a surge in the private sector lending.

The Board of Directors is keen to ensure that the effectiveness of its performance is periodically evaluated and reviewed. The regulatory guidance prescribes such evaluation on an annual basis, and by an external independent evaluator at least once every three years.

Quantitative techniques were used, where a scaled questionnaire was provided for each director’s feedback. Assessments were carried out for the overall Board, Chairman, and President and CEO, board committees and individual directors. A Likert scale from 1 to 6 (1 being strongly disagree and 6 strongly agree) was used to quantify assessment criteria for each section category. Feedback from each director was then collated and analyzed to denote performance in percentage terms against respective categories. The evaluation of the board committees is primarily based on the assessment of the compliance with the terms of reference of each committee. The evaluation criteria for individual directors, is based on their participation, contribution and offering guidance to and understanding of the areas which were relevant to them in their capacity as a board member. The evaluation criteria for the Chairman of the Board in addition to the general criteria, also encompasses leadership abilities and effective management of meetings. This exercise in critical self-assessment allows the Board to evaluate its performance and overall effectiveness in setting strategies, devising control processes, reading market trends by monitoring micro and macroeconomic factors and responding to adverse unforeseen situations to further the cause of a learning organization.

# STATEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS

The Management of Askari Bank Limited (the Bank) assumes full responsibility for establishing and maintaining effective system of internal controls throughout the Bank to ensure reliable, accurate and fair financial reporting, effectiveness of operations and compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. This system encompasses the policies, procedures, and practices implemented by the bank to safeguard its assets, ensure accuracy in financial records, and detect and prevent fraud or errors. It consists of comprehensive & strong processes, effective communication, and a resilient monitoring mechanism, all designed to work in tandem to ensure that the information provided in the financial statements is accurate and free from any material misstatement. The responsibility for establishing such a system lies with the bank’s management, aiming to facilitate effective and efficient operations in a well-controlled environment.

The Bank’s internal control structure comprises of “Three Lines of defense (TOD) model”, Business/Support units, being the first line of defense, manages business risk ‘inherent’ in their day-to-day activities, processes and systems for which they are accountable. Compliance Division serves as second line of defense and primarily responsible for assisting line managers/departments in designing and implementing adequate controls to manage risks of non-compliance. This involves advising on and overseeing the implementation of regulatory requirements and related policies, including AML/CFT/CPF compliance management. Compliance Division works in close collaboration with the business to identify, assess, monitor and report compliance risk.

The Bank’s Compliance & Control Committee of Management (CCM) consisting of the CEO and Senior Executives, plays vital role in ensuring that the bank operates within a strong control environment, adheres to regulatory requirements, and continuously improves its processes to meet evolving business needs. It oversees the management of bank wide compliance risks including assistance / facilitation in implementing Compliance Risk Management Framework. The Compliance function also actively monitors implementation of the corrective / remedial measures to ensure that identified risks are mitigated to safeguard the interest of the Bank.

Internal Audit Division, as the third line of defense, is responsible for providing independent assurance to Board Audit Committee (BAC) on the quality, effectiveness and adequacy of bank’s governance, risk management and control environment including the working of first and second line of defense to achieve risk management and control objectives. Internal Audit assesses the bank’s risk management system, identifies potential risks and evaluates the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies. They examine the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls in financial, operational and compliance areas to ensure that they are properly designed, implemented and functioning as intended.

In compliance with the SBP’s directives, the Bank had completed the implementation of road map regarding Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR). This included detailed documentation of the existing processes, comprehensive evaluation of controls both at entity as well as activity level, development of detailed remedial action plans for the gaps identified as a result of such evaluation and devising comprehensive testing plans of the controls of all processes. Consequent to grant of exemption by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) from the requirement of submission of Long Form Report (LFR), the documentation including the testing results have been reviewed by Internal Auditors of the Bank, on the basis of which Annual Assessment Report is prepared and submitted to Board Audit Committee for review.

Annual Report 2024 55
---
Management understands that the effective maintenance of the internal controls system is an ongoing process. All significant and material findings pointed out by the internal, external auditors and regulators are addressed on priority basis by management. During the year under review, we have endeavored to follow the guidelines issued by SBP on internal controls for evaluation and management of significant risks and we will continue to endeavor for further improvements in the Internal Controls system.

While an internal controls system is effectively implemented and monitored; however, due to inherent limitations, internal controls system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the desired objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

The Board of Directors has endorsed the management’s assessment of internal controls including ICFR in the director’s report.

The responsibility for compliance with the Regulations is that of the Board of Directors of the Bank. Our responsibility is to review whether the Statement of Compliance reflects the status of the Bank’s compliance with the provisions of the Regulations and report if it does not and to highlight any non-compliance with the requirements of the Regulations. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of the Bank’s personnel and review of various documents prepared by the Bank to comply with the Regulations.

As a part of our audit of the financial statements we are required to obtain an understanding of the accounting and internal control systems sufficient to plan the audit and develop an effective audit approach. We are not required to consider whether the Board of Directors’ statement on internal control covers all risks and controls or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of such internal controls, the Bank’s corporate governance procedures and risks.

The Regulations require the Bank to place before the Audit Committee, and upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, place before the Board of Directors for their review and approval, its related party transactions. We are only required and have ensured compliance of this requirement to the extent of the approval of the related party transactions by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the Statement of Compliance does not appropriately reflect the Bank’s compliance, in all material respects, with the requirements contained in the Regulations as applicable to the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2024.

We highlight below instance of non-compliance with the requirement of the Regulation as reflected in para 19 where it is stated in the Statement of Compliance:

# Following is the Key Audit Matter:

|S. No.|Key Audit Matters|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|Credit loss allowance against advances and off-balance sheet items|Refer to notes 10 and 22, and the accounting policy in note 5.1.2 to the unconsolidated financial statements. As at 31 December 2024, the Bank’s Credit loss allowance against advances and off-balance sheet items stands at Rs. 37,315 million and Rs. 756 million, respectively. As per the BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023, the Bank adopted requirements of IFRS 9 along with the Application Instructions issued by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) (hereafter referred to as “application instruction of IFRS 9”) from 1 January 2024 which requires the Bank to recognize Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on advances and off-balance sheet items. The estimation of ECL involves judgement and complexity. The key areas which are subject to complexity and judgement in the estimation of ECL are: - Model estimations – judgmental modelling and assumptions are used to estimate ECL which involves determining Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD). Respective models assumptions are key driver of uncertainty, and are required in the application of these model for calculation of ECL estimate.
- Economic scenarios – IFRS 9 requires the Bank to measure ECL on an unbiased forward-looking basis reflecting a range of future economic conditions. Complex Statistical methodology is applied in determining the forward-looking economic scenarios used as an input to calculate ECL, the associated scenario probability weightings, and the key economic variables that drive the scenarios.
- Qualitative criteria – the criteria selected to identify a SICR involves judgment and can lead to unreliable ECL recognized for certain portfolios.
Our audit procedures, amongst others, included the following: - Performing risk assessment procedures over the credit loss allowance against advances and off-balance sheet exposure within the Bank’s unconsolidated financial statement. As part of these risk assessment procedures, identifying the elements associated with risk of material misstatement on application including those arising from judgements over the estimation of ECL either due to, methods/models, assumptions or data.
- Assessing the design and implementation of key controls established by the Bank over measurement of ECL and provision calculated as per PR.
- We involved in-house specialist who assisted in the following: - Evaluating the Bank’s ECL model methodologies for compliance with application instructions of IFRS 9;
- Assessing the reasonableness of the Bank’s methodology for determining the economic scenarios used and the probability weightings applied to them by independently validating and challenging the assumption, methodologies, and outputs of the models;
- Assessing the reasonableness of macro-economic variables and economic forecasts by comparing these to external sourced data extracted;
- Performing independent testing of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) allowance on a sample basis.
- Assessing the appropriateness of SICR criteria applied by the Bank by ensuring that the SICR criteria and staging methodology are consistent with the application instructions of IFRS 9.
- Ensuring relevance and completeness of the key inputs into the ECL calculations with their respective sub-ledgers and general ledgers.
- Performing testing on sample basis over key inputs into the ECL calculations with their respective source documents.

# KPMG Taseer Hadi & Co.

In connection with our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the unconsolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Chunk 147

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the unconsolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.

## Chunk 148

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the unconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the unconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements:

Based on our audit, we further report that in our opinion:

1. proper books of account have been kept by the Bank as required by the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and the returns referred above from the branches have been found adequate for the purpose of our audit;
2. the unconsolidated statement of financial position, the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account, the unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, the unconsolidated statement of changes in equity and the unconsolidated statement of cash flows together with the notes thereon have been drawn up in conformity with the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and are in agreement with the books of account and returns;
3. investments made, expenditure incurred and guarantees extended during the year were in accordance with the objects and powers of the Bank and the transactions of the Bank which have come to our notice have been within the powers of the Bank; and
4. zakat deductible at source under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance, 1980 (XVIII of 1980), was deducted by the Bank and deposited in the Central Zakat Fund established under section 7 of that Ordinance.

Wherever the requirements of the BCO, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IFRS or IFAS the requirements of the BCO, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives, shall prevail.

The State Bank of Pakistan has deferred the applicability of IFAS 3 ‘Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits’, vide BPRD Circular No. 04 dated February 25, 2015 and International Accounting Standard 40, Investment Property, vide BSD Circular Letter no. 10 dated August 26, 2002, for banking companies till further instructions. Further, the SECP, through S.R.O 411(1)/2008 dated April 28, 2008, has deferred the applicability of IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, to banks. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements.

IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements was made applicable from period beginning on or after January 01, 2015 vide S.R.O 633(I)/2014 dated July 10, 2014 by SECP. However, SECP has directed through S.R.O 56(I)/2016 dated January 28, 2016, that the requirements of consolidation under section 228 of Companies Act 2017 and IFRS–10 “Consolidated Financial Statements” is not applicable in case of investment by companies in mutual funds established under Trust structure. Accordingly, the requirements of this standard has not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As per BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated 29 July 2024, unlisted equity securities are currently carried at the lower of cost or breakup value as per the exemption granted by SBP. Effective from 01 January 2025, as per the requirement of IFRS 9, these will be measured at fair value under IFRS 13.

The Bank received an extension from SBP up to 31 December 2025 for application of Effective interest rate (EIR) in general for all financial assets and liabilities (excluding staff loans / subsidized loans) at amortized cost, net of expected credit loss allowances.

Further, SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 dated 22 January 2025 has clarified the followings:

- Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) are allowed to follow Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) 1 & 2 where applicable and continue the existing accounting methodology on other Islamic products until issuance of further instructions in this regard.
- The treatment of charity should be in line with the existing practices as defined in SBP instructions issued via IBD Circular No. 02 of 2008 and should not be recognized as income.

All Islamic products are governed by the product manual approved by the Shariah Board of the Bank. The related accounting and revenue recognition policies are outlined in notes 5.6.2, 5.15.2 and 5.15.3 of these unconsolidated financial statements, respectively. However, in case of Ijarah and Murabaha, the Bank has also complied with the requirements of IFAS 1 and IFAS 2.

# 2.2 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published approved accounting standards that are effective in the current year

As directed by SBP via BPRD Circular Letter No. 7 of 2023 dated 13 April 2023, IFRS 9, (Financial Instruments) is effective in Pakistan for period beginning on or after 01 January 2024. In addition, due to the application of IFRS 9, SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 02 dated 09 February 2023, has also amended the format of the annual financial statements. Details regarding the aforementioned adoption and amendment, including the impact thereof are discussed in more detail in note 5.1 to these unconsolidated financial statements.

Except for the above, there are certain other interpretations and amendments to accounting and reporting standards that are mandatory for the Bank’s accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. These are either considered not to be relevant or do not have any significant effect on the Bank’s operations and are therefore not detailed in these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of unconsolidated financial statements in conformity with the approved accounting standards requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Bank’s accounting policies. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experiences, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The areas of assumptions and estimates which are significant to the Bank’s financial statements or where judgment was exercised in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

- i) expected credit loss against financial instruments (note 5.1.13)
- ii) staff retirement benefits (note 5.13)
- iii) taxation (note 5.16)

# 5.1 Changes in accounting policies

# 5.1.1 Revised format of unconsolidated financial statements

SBP through its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated 09 February 2023, has amended the format of annual financial statements of banks. All banks are required to prepare their annual financial statements on the revised format effective from accounting year starting from 01 January 2024. Accordingly, the Bank has prepared these unconsolidated financial statements on the new format prescribed by SBP. The adoption of the new format contains additional disclosures and certain changes in the financial statements’ presentation, primarily due to the implementation of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan. However, the corresponding figures continue to be classified and disclosed in accordance with the previous financial accounting and reporting framework. Adoption of revised financial statements format has also resulted in following material changes (due to which the corresponding presentations have also been changed):

- Right–of–use–assets (note 12) amounting to Rs 12,161,484 thousand (December 31, 2023: Rs 8,312,812 thousand) which were previously shown as part of fixed assets are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.
- Lease liabilities (note 20) amounting to Rs 14,136,598 thousand (December 31, 2023: Rs 9,699,474 thousand) which were previously shown as part of other liabilities are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.

## Chunk 165

# 5.1.2 IFRS 9 – ‘Financial Instruments’

During the year, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9: ‘Financial Instruments’ (the Standard) became applicable to the Bank. BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated 05 July 2022 issued by SBP provides detailed instructions on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks.

The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘Expected Credit Losses’ (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses’ approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions from 01 January 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognized in retained earnings and reserves as at 01 January 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard. Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9.

SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated 29 July 2024, has amended and extended the timelines for application instructions. Under the revised guidelines, banks are required to implement modification accounting for financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the Standard. These changes took effect from 01 October 2024, and have been applied retrospectively from 01 January 2024. SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 dated 22 January 2025, SBP further clarifies that modification accounting to be applied to loans modified on or after 01 January 2020.

(a) Certain equity securities are held by the Bank in separate portfolios and are managed with an objective of realising cash flows through sale. The Bank primarily focuses on fair value information and uses that information to assess the securities’ performance and to make decisions.

(b) Units of mutual funds and certain debt securities have contractual cash flows that do not meet the SPPI criteria. These assets are measured at FVTPL under IFRS 9 (AFS to FVTPL). Additionally, certain debt securities held by the Bank in a transitory capacity, with the intent to pass them on to customers, fall under the “Held to Sell” business model and are also measured at FVTPL.

(c) Certain debt securities are held by the Bank in separate portfolios to meet everyday liquidity needs. The Bank seeks to minimise the costs of managing these liquidity needs and therefore actively manages the return on the portfolio. That return consists of collecting contractual payments as well as gains and losses from the sale of financial assets. The investment strategy often results in sales activity that is significant in value. The Bank considers that under IFRS 9 these securities are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. Moreover, certain equity investments held by the Bank have been designated under IFRS 9 as at FVOCI. (AFS to FVOCI).

(d) Debt securities that were previously classified as held–to–maturity are now classified at amortised cost. The Bank intends to hold the assets to maturity to collect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist solely of payments of principal and profit on the principal amount outstanding. (HTM to AC).

(e) Advances except for Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), staff loans and modified financing are stated at cost. Whereas, Temporary Economic Refinance Scheme, staff loans and modified financing are stated at amortized cost.

## Chunk 167

# 5.1.4 Impact on regulatory capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the banks, which has reduced their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the Application Instructions issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement.

The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the “transitional adjustment amount”) must be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the “transition period” of five years.

Moreover, SBP has allowed to adjust the amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions in Tier 2 Capital that have not been added back to CET 1 and vice versa as per Annexure A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024 dated 29 July 2024. Had IFRS 9 been applied at 31 December 2023 then CAR would have been lower by 49 bps from 18.35% to 17.86%.

## Chunk 168

# 5.1.5 Classification and measurement

Under the new Standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) regardless of the business model in which they are held.

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# Recognition and initial measurement

Debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at transaction price. The fair value of a financial asset on initial recognition is generally its transaction price. If the Bank determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognized in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account on an appropriate basis over the life of the asset but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data, or the transaction is closed out. Advances other than staff loans, Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations are initially measured at transaction price i.e., the amount of loan disbursed at disbursement date. Staff loans, Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) loans and advances pertaining to overseas operations are recognized at fair value at the time of disbursement. The fair value is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using the prevailing market rates for instruments.

---

## Chunk 170

# Classification

# Financial Assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset excluding advances with the exception of staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations is classified as measured at amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL. A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment–by–investment basis. Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in scope of the Standard are never bifurcated. Instead, the whole hybrid instrument is assessed for classification. Advances are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, excluding staff loans, Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations, which are measured at amortized cost. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Bank changes its business models for managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following changes in the business model.

## Chunk 171

# IFRS 9 allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVTPL

if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any ‘accounting mismatch’ that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different basis. SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout life of the instrument.

---

## Chunk 172

# Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognized in profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method. Markup expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit and loss.

---

## Chunk 173

# 5.1.6 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either Held to collect (HTC), Held to collect and Sell (HTC&S) and Held to Sell (HTS) based on Business model assessment. The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The assessment requires judgement based on facts and circumstances on the date of assessment. The assessment considers the policies and objectives for the portfolio of financial assets, risk affecting, performance evaluation, business manager’s compensation and historical sales information.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

---

## Chunk 174

# 5.1.7 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as interest margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Bank considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Bank considers:

- contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
- leverage features;
- prepayment and extension terms;
- terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non–recourse loans); and
- features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).

A prepayment feature aligns with SPPI if it mainly represents unpaid principal and profit, including reasonable compensation for early termination.

The Bank holds a portfolio of long–term fixed–rate loans for which the Bank has the option to propose to revise the interest rate at periodic reset dates. These reset rights are limited to the market rate at the time of revision. The borrowers have an option to either accept the revised rate or redeem the loan at par without penalty.

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

Bank has determined that the contractual cash flows of these loan are SPPI because the option varies the interest rate in a way that is consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and costs associated with the principal amount outstanding.

# 5.1.8 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

|Financial assets at|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any markup or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.|

|FVOCI| |
|Equity investments|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are adjusted from the carrying value of investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to income statement.|
|at FVOCI| |
|Advances at cost|Advances are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, excluding staff loans, Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations, which are measured at amortized cost, net of expected credit loss allowances.|

---

## Chunk 177

# 5.1.9 Amortised cost and gross carrying amount

The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount for investments and lendings to financial institution. For financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance or impairment allowance before 01 January 2024.

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

---

## Chunk 178

# 5.1.10 Calculation of markup income and expense

Income from performing advances of the domestic operations is recognised on accrual basis as per the terms of the contract. However, where debt securities, classified as investments in the financial statements, are purchased at premium or discount, such premium / discount including the transaction cost is amortized through the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account over the remaining maturity of the debt security using the effective interest rate method. The interest income on staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations is recognized in line with the EIR method, while any expected credit losses are assessed and accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9.

Similarly, under the local regulatory requirement, income recoverable on classified domestic advances and investments (debt securities), is recognized on a receipt basis. Income on rescheduled / restructured advances and investments is recognized as permitted by SBP regulations. In case of overseas operations, income on the financial assets is recognised under the effective interest rate method or as prescribed by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which the Bank operates. Markup expense on domestic financial liabilities (comprising deposits, subordinated debts, and borrowings) is recognized on an accrual basis in the period in which it is incurred, based on contracted rates.

# 5.1.11 Derecognition

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised), and the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in OCI is recognized in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss, except that in case of the derecognition of equity securities held at FVOCI, cumulative gains or losses are transferred to unappropriated profit.

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

---

## Chunk 180

# 5.1.12 Modification

Financial assets

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs.

If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

Where derecognition of financial assets is appropriate, the newly recognised residual loans are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classified as purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI).

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the bank first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective yield rate of the asset and recognised the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit and loss account.

If such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as profit income calculated using the effective yield rate method.

---

## Chunk 182

# Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability recognised and consideration paid is recognised in profit and loss account.

If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective yield rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit and loss account. For floating-rate financial liabilities, the original effective yield rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective yield rate on the instrument.

---

## Chunk 183

# 5.1.13 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (ECL) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (12–month ECL). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL).

---

## Chunk 184

# Measurement of ECL

ECL is a probability–weighted estimate of credit losses. It is measured as follows:

- financial assets that are not credit–impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive);
- financial assets that are credit–impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows;
- undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive; and
- financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Bank expects to recover.

## Chunk 185

# Non–Performing financial assets

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost, at cost and, debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit-impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘non–performing’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit–impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- the restructuring of a loan by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit–impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit–impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.

Under SBP’s IFRS 9 Application instructions, the Bank is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. The Bank is required to calculate ECL on its non–performing financial assets as higher of provision under Prudential Regulations (PR) and ECL under IFRS 9. Further, the Bank recognizes income on impaired assets (loans classified under PRs i.e., OAEM and Stage 3 loans) on a receipt basis in accordance with the requirements of PR issued by SBP.

The Bank calculates the ECL against corporate, commercial, SME and retail loan portfolios as higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at borrower level.

ECL is a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses which is determined by multiplying the probability of default with the loss given default with the expected exposure at the time of default. Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 Application Instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12- month ECL, Stage1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2). PD is estimated using internal rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk rating. The Bank has used a statistical method for the estimation of Through the Cycle (TTC) PDs associated with each of its obligors risk rating. PD are then adjusted with forward looking information for calculation of ECL. Forward looking information is incorporated to convert TTC PD to Point in Time Probability of Default (PiT) PD. The bank has estimated PiT PDs in its PD model. For this purpose the Bank incorporated five years forecast obtained from the Macro Economic Variable (MEV) database of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
- EAD: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant. The Bank estimates EAD for financial assets carried at an amortised cost and carried at cost equal to principal plus profit. Each repayment date is assumed to be default point in the model and the ECL is calculated on EAD at each reporting date and discounted at the effective interest rate or contractual interest rate for advances other than staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations for which effective interest rate is used. The unutilized exposures are multiplied with credit conversion factors (CCF) to compute the EAD of revolving facilities. Additionally liquid collateral that the Bank holds are adjusted from the EAD and the ECL is computed on the net amount.

## Chunk 187

# Presentation of allowance for Expected Credit Loss in the Unconsolidated Statement of Financial Position

Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the unconsolidated statement of financial position as follows:

- Financial assets measured at amortized cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets.
- For advances measured at cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the advances.
- Loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: as a provision in other liabilities.
- Where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Bank does not identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component and instead presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision;
- Debt instruments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance is recognized in the unconsolidated statement of financial position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value.

## Chunk 188

# 5.1.14 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PR issued by SBP. Financial assets in Stage 2 may be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum period of 6 months from initial downgrade is required before any facility is moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to move back from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it should meet the criteria defined under the respective Prudential Regulations for de–classification of account / facility. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure–C of BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022. However, banks are free to choose more stringent days past due criteria. The Bank aligns its policy with Annexure–C of BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022; hence, SICR is considered if credit exposure exceeds 60 days past due.

## Chunk 189

# 5.1.15 Undrawn loan commitments and guarantees:

Financial guarantees are contracts that require the Bank to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Loan commitments are firm commitments to provide credit under pre–specified terms and conditions.

84 Askari Bank Limited
---
When estimating lifetime ECL for undrawn loan commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the loans are drawn down, based on a probability–weighting of the three scenarios.

---

## Chunk 190

# 5.1.16 Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank has adopted a governance framework requiring multiple functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. The Risk Department defines the staging criteria for the new impairment model and take ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach. Additionally, the Risk department takes the ownership of the impact of ECL on the Bank’s capital.

The Bank’s Finance Division performs ECL calculation. As a result, the department then assesses the financial impact, meets the financial reporting requirements and further monitors the impact on the financial ratios.

As per the Bank’s policy, the Bank’s Internal Audit function carries out periodic reviews of IFRS 9 methodology and impacts calculated by the Management.

The provision for expected credit losses against advances is charged to the profit and loss account. Advances are written off when there is no realistic prospect of recovery.

The Bank reviews its loan portfolio to assess the amount of non–performing advances and provision required thereon, on regular basis. While assessing this requirement various factors including the delinquency in the account, financial position of the borrowers and the requirements of the PR are considered.

# 5.6.2 Islamic financing and related assets

Ijarahs booked under Islamic Financial Accounting Standard 2 – Ijarah (IFAS – 2) are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment if any, and are shown under advances. Depreciation on Ijarah assets is charged to profit and loss account by applying the straight line method whereby the depreciable value of Ijarah assets is written off over the Ijarah period. The Bank charges depreciation from the date of delivery of respective assets to Mustajir up to the date of maturity / termination of Ijarah agreement.

In Murabaha transactions, the Bank purchases the goods through its agent or client and after taking possession, sells them to the customer on cost plus profit basis either in a spot or credit transaction. Under Murabaha financing, funds disbursed for purchase of goods are recorded as ‘Advance against Murabaha finance’. On culmination of Murabaha i.e. sale of goods to customers, Murabaha financing are recorded at the deferred sale price. Goods purchased but remaining unsold at the statement of financial position date are recorded as inventories.

In Salam financing, the Bank pays full in advance to its customer for buying specified goods / commodities to be delivered to the Bank within an agreed time. The goods are then sold and the amount financed is received back by the Bank along with profit.

In Musharaka a relationship is established under a contract by the mutual consent of the Bank and the customer for sharing of profits and losses arising from a joint enterprise or venture.

Diminishing Musharaka (DM) is a form of co–ownership in which Bank and the customer share the ownership of a tangible asset in an agreed proportion and customer undertakes to buy in periodic installments the proportionate share of the Bank until the title to such tangible asset is completely transferred to the customer. The rental payment is recognized as profit while the assets transfer / sale payments are applied towards reducing the outstanding principal.

In Istisna financing, the Bank acquires the described goods to be manufactured by the customer from raw material of its own and deliver to the Bank within an agreed time. The goods are then sold and the amount financed is received back by the Bank along with profit.

In Running Musharaka based financing, the Bank enters into financing with the customer based on Shirkat–ul–Aqd or Business Partnership in the customer’s operating business where the funds can be withdrawn or refunded during the Musharaka period.

The Bank values its inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost necessary to make the sale. Cost of inventories represents actual purchases made by the Bank / customers as an agent of the Bank for subsequent sale. Inventory against each contract is maintained on specific identification method.

## Chunk 196

# Property and equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less impairment losses and accumulated depreciation except for freehold / leasehold land. Land is carried at revalued amounts which is not depreciated. Land is revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are taken to the profit and loss account.

Surplus arising on revaluation of fixed assets is credited to the surplus on revaluation of assets account and is shown under the shareholders’ equity in the unconsolidated statement of financial position. Except to the extent actually realized on disposal of land which are revalued, the surplus on revaluation of land shall not be applied to set–off or reduce any deficit or loss, whether past, current or future, or in any manner applied, adjusted or treated so as to add to the income, profit or surplus of the Bank or utilized directly or indirectly by way of dividend or bonus. Surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit.

## Chunk 197

# Intangible assets

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets are amortized from the month when these assets are available for use, using the straight line method, whereby the cost of the intangible assets are amortized over its estimated useful lives over which economic benefits are expected to flow to the Bank. The useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.

---

## Chunk 198

# Depreciation / amortization

Depreciation / amortization is computed on monthly basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets at the rates set out in note 11.2 and 13.1 respectively on monthly basis. The cost of assets is depreciated / amortized on straight line basis, except for buildings which are depreciated on reducing balance method. Depreciation / amortization commences when the related asset is available for use and discontinues when the asset is disposed off or retired from the active use. Maintenance and normal repairs are charged to profit and loss account as and when incurred.

In making estimates of the depreciation / amortization, the management uses useful life and residual value which reflects the pattern in which economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Bank. The useful life and the residual value are reviewed at each financial year end and any change in these estimates in future years might effect the carrying amounts of the respective item of operating fixed assets with the corresponding effect on depreciation / amortization charge.

# 5.9   IFRS 16 – Leases

A lessee recognizes a right–of–use (ROU) asset representing its right of using the underlying asset and a corresponding lease liability representing its obligations to make lease payments.

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payment, discounted using the Bank’s contract wise incremental borrowing rate. The lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The lease liability is also remeasured to reflect any reassessment or change in lease terms. These remeasurements of lease liabilities are recognised as adjustments to the carrying amount of related ROU assets after the date of initial recognition.

Each lease payment is allocated between a reduction of the liability and a finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the profit and loss account as markup expense over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

The ROU assets are initially measured based on the initial amount of the lease liability plus any initial direct costs incurred. ROU assets are subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation. The ROU assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term as this method most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits. The estimated useful lives of ROU assets are determined on the same basis as that used for owned assets. The ROU assets are reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of lease liability.

# 5.10  Borrowings (Repo)

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# 5.21 Financial assets and liabilities

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized at the time when the Bank becomes a party to the
contractual provision of the instrument. Financial assets are de–recognized when the contractual right to
future cash flows from the asset expires or is transferred along with the risk and reward of the asset. Financial
liabilities are de–recognized when obligation specific in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. Any
gain or loss on de–recognition of the financial asset and liability is recognized in the profit and loss account of
the current period. The particular recognition and subsequent measurement methods adopted for significant
financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed in the individual policy statements associated with them.

---

## Chunk 218

# 5.22 Derivative financial instruments

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract
is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value using appropriate valuation techniques. All
derivative financial instruments are carried as assets when fair value is positive and liabilities when fair value is
negative. Any change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments is taken to the profit and loss account.
The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation
techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant interest rates in effect at the reporting date
and the rates contracted.

# 5.23 Appropriations subsequent to date of unconsolidated statement of financial position

Appropriations subsequent to year end are recognized during the year in which those appropriations are made.

## Chunk 219

these are approved / transfers are made.

## Chunk 220

# 5.25 Earnings per share

or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Bank by the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary
shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive
potential ordinary shares, if any.

# 26 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Bank at present does not offer derivative products such as Interest Rate Swaps, Cross Currency Swaps, Forward Rate Agreements or Foreign Exchange Options. The Bank’s Treasury and Investment Banking Groups buy and sell derivative instruments such as Forward Exchange Contracts (FECs) and Equity Futures (EFs).

---

## Chunk 276

# 26.1 Forward exchange contracts (FECs)

FECs is a product offered to clients to hedge FX risk. The traders use this product to hedge themselves from unfavourable movements in a foreign currency, however, by agreeing to fix the exchange rate, they do not benefit from favourable movements in that currency.

FECs is a contract between the obligor and the Bank in which both agree to exchange an amount of one currency for another currency at an agreed forward exchange rate for settlement over more than two business days after the FECs is entered into (the day on which settlement occurs is called the value date). FECs is entered with those obligors whose credit worthiness has already been assessed, and they have underlined trade transactions.

If the relevant exchange rate moves unfavourably, the Bank will lose money, and obligor will benefit from that movement because the Bank must exchange currencies at the FEC rate. In order to mitigate this risk of adverse exchange rate movement, the Bank manages its exposure by hedging forward position in inter–bank foreign exchange.

# 26.2  Equity futures

An equity futures contract is a standardized contract, traded on a futures counter of the stock exchange, to buy or sell a certain underlying scrip at a certain date in the future, at a specified price.

The Bank uses equity futures as a hedging instrument to hedge its equity portfolio against equity price risk. Only selected shares are allowed to be traded on futures exchange as determined by the Exchange.

Equity futures give flexibility to the Bank either to take delivery on the future settlement date or to settle it by adjusting the notional value of the contract based on the current market rates.

Maximum exposure limit to the equity futures is 10% of Tier I Capital of the Bank, based on prevailing SBP Regulations.

The Risk Management Group monitors the Bank’s exposure in equity futures and forward exchange contracts. Positions in equity futures and forward exchange contracts are marked–to–market. Forward contracts are included in measures of portfolio volatility including Value at Risk (VaR). Forward exchange contracts and equity futures are also included in capital charge and Risk Weighted Asset calculation in accordance with SBP Regulations.

The accounting policies used to recognize and disclose derivatives are given in note 5.22.

# ii)

The Bank has filed tax returns for and up to tax year 2024. The assessments for and up to tax year 2023 were amended by the tax authorities creating accumulated additional tax demand, mainly in the matters of admissibility of recoveries against doubtful debts for Rs 1,119 million, provision for diminution in the value of investments for Rs 3,144.44 million, bad debts written off for Rs 242.892 million, provision for substandard advances for Rs 74.95 million, Provision against other assets/fixed assets for Rs 145.81 million, disallowance of employee benefit expenses Rs 228.680 million, disallowance of depreciation on lease assets Rs 773.88 and other disallowances of expenses/credits for Rs 551.78 million. Bank’s appeals against these orders are currently pending before Commissioner Appeals, Appellate Tribunal and Islamabad High Court. The management and tax advisor of the Bank are confident that these matters will be decided in favor of the Bank and consequently no provision has been made thereon. Tax payments by the Bank against certain matters are being carried forward as receivable, as management and tax advisor of the Bank are confident of their realization.

# iii)

Consequent upon the amalgamation with and into the Bank, the outstanding tax issues relating to Askari Leasing Limited (ALL) are as follows:

Tax returns of ALL have been filed for and up to tax year 2010. The returns for the tax years 2003 to 2010 were amended by the tax authorities mainly in the matter of admissibility of initial allowance claimed on leased vehicles. On appeals filed by ALL, partial relief was provided by the CIR(A) by allowing initial allowance on commercial vehicles. Re–assessment has not yet been carried out by the tax department. A tax demand is however not likely to arise after re–assessment.

For and up to the assessment years 2002–2003, reference applications filed by the tax authorities in the matter of computation of lease income are pending decisions by the High Court. However, the likelihood of an adverse decision is considered low due to a favorable decision of the High Court in a parallel case.

# 39.15 Significant risk associated with the staff retirement benefit scheme:

Longevity Risks: The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population.

Salary Increase Risk: The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the benefit is linked with final salary. The risk arises when the actual increases are higher than expectation and impacts the liability accordingly.

Withdrawal Risk: The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

# 43 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as Amortised Cost, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified under held to collect are carried at amortised cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break–up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term advances, fixed term deposits and borrowings, other assets and other liabilities cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 43.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) available at Mutual Fund Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) and Reuters page.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2 and level 3:

|Federal Government Securities|The fair values of Federal Government Securities are determined on the basis of rates / prices sourced from Reuters.|
|---|---|
|Non Government Debt Securities|Non Government Debt Securities are valued on the basis of rates announced by MUFAP.|
|Foreign Government Debt Securities|Foreign Government Debt Securities are valued on the basis of rates taken from custodian of the securities which are usually drawn from Bloomberg.|
|Unit of Mutual Funds|Fair values of mutual funds are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of reporting period.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions|The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.|
|Fixed Assets and Non Banking Assets Acquired in Satisfaction of Claims|Land and Non Banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are valued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessments of the market value of the assets.|

# 47 CAPITAL ADEQUACY, LEVERAGE RATIO & LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS

The objective of managing capital is to safeguard the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it could continue to provide adequate returns to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk. It is the policy of the Bank to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Bank recognises the need to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with greater exposure and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.

Under the current scenario, the banks are under pressure to extend further credit to its borrowers, while overall deteriorating credit risk and increased NPL may also put additional pressures on the Bank from Capital Adequacy Ratio perspective. The SBP has relaxed the Capital Conversion Buffer (CCB) requirements for the banks to 1.5%, resulting in an overall CAR requirement of 11.5%. In addition to the measures by SBP, the Bank is continuously monitoring the impacts of various decisions of its CAR and taking further lending decisions based on the overall impacts on RWA. The Bank also believes that it has sufficient buffer in its CAR requirement to meet any adverse movements in credit, market or operational risks.

# 48 RISK MANAGEMENT

The Bank believes that effective risk management is key to achieving desired level of return while maintaining
acceptable level of risk exposure. Robust risk management processes and framework are in place to achieve
the Bank’s overall objectives through a well thought out strategy, which enables the Bank to effectively manage
Credit, Market, Operational and Liquidity risk in a proactive manner.

The Bank’s approach is to ensure that risk management is deeply and firmly embedded in the culture of the Bank.
All employees are therefore considered responsible for identification, measurement, monitoring and controlling
risks within the scope of their assigned responsibilities. As a result of changing risk environment, the Bank
continuously monitors and conducts holistic assessment of complex transactions on an integrated basis.

The Bank has a Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) in place and is updated regularly by the Bank’s
Risk Management Group. BRMC is responsible for reviewing the extent of design and adequacy of the risk
management framework. BRMC oversight ensures that risks are managed within the level of tolerance and risk
appetite of the Bank.

---

## Chunk 323

# 48.1 Credit Risk:

Credit risk arises from the potential that an obligor is either unwilling to perform on an obligation or its ability
is impaired resulting in economic loss to the Bank. The Bank takes necessary measures to control such risk
by establishing minimum standards and rules for booking credit exposures and subsequently, by monitoring
these exposures – limiting transactions with specific counter parties with increased likelihood of default and
continually assessing creditworthiness of its obligors.

The Bank has built and maintains a sound loan portfolio in line with a well defined Credit Policy approved by
the Board of Directors. Its credit evaluation system comprises well-designed credit appraisal, sanctioning and
review procedures for the purpose of emphasizing prudence in its lending activities and ensuring quality of asset
portfolio. Advances portfolio constitutes around 28% of the total asset base and is also the largest source of
credit risk for the Bank. The Bank’s advances portfolio is well diversified across various business segments and
industries. The Bank employs a robust Credit Risk Rating model that systematically assigns ratings to obligors
based on assessment of their quantitative and qualitative factors.

Risk mitigants have been put in place at all stages of credit risk cycle i.e. identification, measurement, monitoring,
controlling and reporting for effective credit risk management. Accordingly, portfolio monitoring function is in
place with dedicated resources to ensure that the risk is effectively monitored and reported.

Credit Risk Review is conducted at obligor as well as at portfolio level to ensure adherence to regulatory
requirement as well as internal policies and procedures. The review process ensures that a sound and proactive
risk management culture is maintained across the Bank. Credit is approved under the 4 eye principal with equal
ownership from both Business functions and Risk Management Group (RMG). Audit (Risk Assets Review)
division reviews the advances portfolio on a post approval basis.

The Bank has undertaken a number of initiatives to strengthen its credit risk management framework including
in–house development of internal risk rating models (obligor and facility) for the portfolio for respective
segments, and transition and migration matrices to study the realized default rates and performance of the risk
rating models over the years.

Keeping in view the deteriorating economic situation, Rapid Portfolio Reviews are performed to identify vulnerable accounts and decide account specific strategies with respect to exposure and to estimate possible additional provisioning. Results of the Rapid Portfolio Reviews are shared with senior management and Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC).

Provision for expected credit losses is determined in accordance with the SBP’s requirements and IFRS 9. Provision for credit portfolio is determined in accordance with the SBP’s relevant Prudential Regulations. The Bank also maintains additional provision on subjective classification basis in line with its prudent approach.

Stress testing for credit risk is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of increase in non – performing loans and to ensure that CAR is maintained at sufficient level to meet regulatory requirement and business needs.

The Bank has implemented an Enterprise Risk Management solution and Loan Origination System. These systems not only enhance operational efficiency in the risk management processes, but also promote integrated risk assessment.

Risk Asset Review (RAR) performs an independent review of the credit portfolio. It provides an independent assessment of portfolio quality, efficacy of processes for acquisition of risk assets, regulatory/policy compliance and appropriateness of classification and risk rating.

A centralized Credit Administration Division (CAD) under Operations Group is working to ensure that terms and conditions of approval of credit sanctions are complied, all documentation is complete and fully enforceable, all disbursements of approved facilities are made only after necessary authorization by CAD and collateral is monitored on regular basis. Cash, deposits under lien, Government securities and eligible guarantees etc. are considered as eligible collateral.

To handle the specific needs of managing classified accounts, the Bank has a separate Special Asset Management Division (SAMD) to negotiate settlement of the non–performing exposure, including pursuing litigation, if required, to protect the interests of the depositors and shareholders.

## Chunk 324

# 48.1.1 Credit risk – General disclosures

The Bank follows the Standardized Approach for its credit risk exposures, which sets out fixed risk weights corresponding to external credit ratings or type of exposure, whichever is applicable.

Under the Standardized Approach, the capital requirement is based on the credit rating assigned to counterparties by External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) duly recognized by the SBP. The Bank selects particular ECAIs for each type of exposure. The Bank utilizes the credit ratings assigned by Pakistan Credit Rating Agency (PACRA), Japan Credit Rating Company Limited – Vital Information Systems (JCR–VIS), Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poors (S&P).

# 48.1.8 Forward–looking information contained in ECL

The Bank’s Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculation incorporates forward–looking information by integrating
macroeconomic variables to enhance the accuracy and reliability of credit risk estimates. The use of forward–
looking data helps in better predicting potential credit losses under different economic conditions.

To estimate Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD), the Bank utilizes historical and forecasted
macroeconomic data. For ECL calculations, the Bank considers Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price
Index (CPI), Unemployment, Exports and Imports as the primary macroeconomic variables, with forecasted data
sourced from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The selection of these variables is based on their relevance
and sensitivity to specific portfolios.

The Bank has developed three macroeconomic scenarios—Base, Best, and Worst—to reflect potential economic
conditions. These scenarios have been assigned probability weightings of 68% for the Base scenario, 16% for the
Best scenario, and 16% for the Worst scenario to ensure a comprehensive assessment of credit risk exposure.

As part of its forward–looking assessment, the Bank conducted a sensitivity analysis on macroeconomic
indicators used in Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculations. As of December 31, 2024, the Bank developed three
scenarios—Base, Best, and Worst—based on a five–year forecast. A 10% change in macroeconomic variables
mentioned above in the weighted average scenario was applied to assess the upside and downside impact on
ECL. The resulting variations are as follows:

|Rupees in ‘000|Upwards|Downwards|
|---|---|---|
|Expected credit loss allowance|3.71%|(1.18%)|

## Chunk 336

# Sensitivity of ECL to Future Economic Conditions

The ECL are sensitive to judgements and assumption made regarding formulation of forward–looking scenarios
and how much such scenarios are incorporated into calculations. The Bank performs sensitivity analysis on the
ECL.

The table below shows the loss allowance assuming each forward–looking scenario (e.g. Base, Best and Worst)
were weighted 100% instead of applying scenario probability across the three scenarios.

|Province / Region|Total ECL as per FS|Total ECL after sensitivity analysis|Increase / decrease in %|Total ECL after sensitivity analysis|Increase / decrease in %|Total ECL after sensitivity analysis|Increase / decrease in %|

# 48.2 Market Risk:

Market risk is the risk that the value of on and off–balance sheet positions of a financial institution will be adversely affected by movements in market rates or prices such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and credit spreads, resulting in a loss to earnings and capital.

The Bank is exposed to market risk from both its banking and trading books. Trading book for the Bank includes all Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL) securities along with Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) securities. All assets not included in trading book are included in the Banking book.

The Bank’s Risk Management Process seeks to identify, measure, monitor, and control market risks in order to shield against adverse movements in market factors and to attain an efficient risk / return profile of its open positions. Risk Management Group has developed and implemented market risk policy and risk measurement / monitoring methodology for review and reporting of market risk.

The Bank makes use of the globally established Value–at–Risk (VaR) methodology to measure traded market risk. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is carried out to gauge the impact of extreme market movements on traded exposures, such as fixed income securities and equity capital market instruments.

Further, stress testing is used to analyze the impact of abnormal market movements across different portfolios to assess non–traded market risk, in particular interest rate risk in the banking book. The performance of the Bank’s traded portfolios is evaluated through the use of risk / return analysis. Risk is assessed through the revaluation of all traded market risk exposed positions on a daily basis, and monitored by ensuring that these positions do not breach any regulatory limits as well as any internally established risk tolerance limits.

Basel III Standardized Approach is used for calculating the Capital Adequacy for Market Risk.

Total capital charge for market risk is Rs. 79,618,578 thousand (2023: Rs. 29,300,677 thousand).

# 48.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk, or the risk that the Bank’s earnings and / or capital can fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates, arises out of the Bank’s foreign exchange exposure which consists of foreign currency cash in hand, nostro / vostro accounts, forward contracts, forward bookings with exporters, foreign bills purchased, foreign currency placements with SBP and the Bank’s Wholesale Bank Branch, foreign currency lendings / deposits and capital investments in offshore operations.

The Bank’s treasury manages consolidated foreign exchange exposure by matching foreign currency assets and liabilities in spot and forward. The foreign exchange exposure and nostro balances are maintained within regulatory limits and VaR is calculated for consolidated foreign exchange exposure on a daily basis. The impact of a change in USD / PKR parity on the net open position is also determined through daily sensitivity analysis.

# 48.2.3 Equity position risk

Equity position risk is the risk that the value of equity positions inside the trading book and banking book will change as a result of general and specific equity market movements. Equity positions are monitored on daily basis through management action triggers.

The Bank classifies its direct equity investments into Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL), Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), and Amortized Cost (AC). FVTPL exposures are of a short term nature and are undertaken to earn profit by exploiting market conditions and short term price fluctuations.

Equities held in the FVOCI portfolio are kept with the intent of earning profit due to underlying fundamental strength of each security. Strategic investments are undertaken in line with the long–term strategy of the Bank, i.e. to build strategic interest in other concerns. The Bank may also carry indirect equity exposure through financing against shares and reverse repos against shares.

At the end of FY 2024 Bank’s investment in mutual funds and equity investment portfolio was classified as FVTPL and FVOCI. Pretax impact of 5% decrease in the prices are provided below;

# 48.2.4 Yield / Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)–Basel III Specific

The Bank’s interest rate exposure arises out of its investment, lending and borrowing activities. Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) in its various forms is the risk of adverse changes in earnings and/or capital due to (i) timing differences or mismatches in the maturity/repricing period of financial assets and liabilities (repricing risk), (ii) differences in the basis used for calculating interest rates received and paid (basis risk), (iii) and options implicit or explicit in the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities (options risk). The Asset and Liability Management Committee of the Bank monitors and controls mismatch of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis through its regular meetings. The Market Risk Management Department monitors interest rate in the banking book from an earnings and economic value perspective.

Key IRRBB measures include:

1. Interest Earnings at Risk (IAR): the rolling 12–month impact of a parallel shift in interest rates on Net Interest Margin.
2. Change in Economic Value of Equity (EVE): the impact of a parallel shift in interest rates on the present value of the Bank’s cash flows.
3. Repricing Gaps: mismatch between the Bank’s assets and liabilities in terms of repricing time bands based on residual maturity for repricing or actual maturity which ever is earlier. Repricing assumptions for non–contractual assets and liabilities have been set based on a behavioral study.

The Bank has dedicated functions to manage Operational Risk, Business Continuity Risk and Information Security Risk governed through comprehensive frameworks in line with international best practices.

# 48.4   Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk reflects an enterprises inability in raising funds to meet commitments. The Bank’s liquidity position is managed by the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). ALCO monitors the maintenance of financial position, liquidity ratios, depositors concentration both in terms of the overall funding mix and to avoid undue reliance on large individual deposits. Moreover, core retail deposits (current accounts and saving accounts) form a considerable part of the Bank’s overall funding and significant importance is attached to the stability and growth of these deposits.

The Bank is confident that the liquidity buffer currently maintained is sufficient to cater to any adverse movement in the cash flow maturity profile.

# REPORT OF SHARIAH BOARD

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful

SBP’s Shariah Governance Framework requires the BoD to meet with Shariah Board (SB) at least on a half yearly basis to; (a) have a detailed briefing on the Shariah compliance environment, the issues/weaknesses (if any), and recommendations to improve Shariah compliance environment, and (b) ensure timely and effective enforcement of the SB’s decisions, fatawa, observations and recommendations.

While the Board of Directors and Executive Management are solely responsible to ensure that the operations of Askari Ikhlas Islamic Banking are conducted in a manner that comply with Shariah Principles at all times, we are required by the SBP’s Shariah Governance Framework to submit a report on the overall Shariah compliance environment of Askari Ikhlas Islamic Banking.

During the year 2024, four mandatory meetings of Shariah Board were held to review various Shariah matters, which predominantly included new products, existing product modifications, re-alignment of manuals & policies, Shariah reports etc. Apart from the mandatory quarterly meetings, the Shariah Board also continually remained involved for all Shariah matters of the Bank, by way of circulation.

To form our opinion as expressed in this report, the Shariah Compliance Department of the Bank carried out reviews, on test check basis, of each class of transactions, the relevant documentation and process flows. Further, we have also reviewed the Shariah audit reports.

Based on above, we are of the view that Askari Ikhlas Islamic Banking:

1. has complied with the Shariah rules and principles in the light of fatawa, rulings and guidelines issued by its Shariah Board.
2. has complied with directives, regulations, instructions and guidelines related to Shariah compliance issued by SBP in accordance with the rulings of SBP’s Shariah Board.
3. has a comprehensive mechanism in place to ensure Shariah compliance in its overall operations.
4. has a well-defined system in place, which is sound enough to ensure that any earnings realized from sources or by means prohibited by Shariah have been credited to charity account and are being properly utilized.
5. has complied with the SBP instructions on profit and loss distribution and pool management.
6. level of awareness, capacity and sensitization of the staff, management and the BOD in appreciating the importance of Shariah compliance in the products and processes of the Bank is adequate and shall be further strengthened through the on-going orientation sessions / trainings.
7. has provided adequate resources to Shariah Board, enabling it to discharge its duties, effectively. However, in view of Bank’s Islamic conversion, Shariah audit and Shariah compliance functions need further strengthening for the due discharge of their responsibilities.

We appreciate management’s efforts for undertaking various capacity building initiatives for upskilling Islamic banking knowledge & expertise of Bank’s staff. Keeping in view the Islamic conversion of the Bank, we recommend to strengthen the training department through dedicated staff for imparting Islamic banking trainings.

# 11. POOL MANAGEMENT

# 11.1

Bank generates deposit on the basis of following two modes:

1. Qard
2. Mudaraba

Deposits taken on Qard Basis are classified as ‘Current Account’ and deposits generated on Mudaraba basis are classified as ‘Savings Account’ and ‘Fixed Deposit Accounts’. The Bank also accepted / acquired customer and inter–bank funds, for short term liquidity requirement under Musharaka mode. Profits realized in Musharaka pools are distributed in pre agreed profit sharing ratio. Besides above, the bank also accept funds from State Bank of Pakistan in Islamic Export Refinance pool under Musharaka mode. The features, risk and reward of this Musharaka pool are in accordance with the SBP IERS scheme and circulars issued from time to time.

Asset pools are created at the Bank’s discretion and the Bank can add, amend, and transfer an asset to any other pool in the interest of deposit holders. During the year following two Mudaraba based customer pools were maintained by the Bank having below mentioned key features:

---

## Chunk 373

# a. General Pool

The objective of the pool is to invest funds on a Shariah Compliant basis and maximize profits for the Rabb–ul–Mal on a Gross Mudaraba Basis. As required under regulatory instructions, SBP funds obtained under it’s various schemes are also made part of General pool. In this pool, portfolio diversification strategy has been used to mitigate the risk of loss. Diversification may marginally reduce returns but it also spreads risk by reducing chances of loss.

---

## Chunk 374

# b. Foreign Currency Pool

The objective of the pool is to invest funds on a Shariah Compliant basis and maximize profits for the Rabb–ul–Mal i.e. depositors in foreign currency: US dollars on a Gross Mudaraba Basis. Due to dearth and limitations of foreign denominated investment opportunities available to Islamic Banks operating in Pakistan, the returns would be linked with an earning assets pool comprising of Shariah compliant assets, with reliance mainly on placement(s) with other known Islamic Financial Institutions, Islamic modes of financing, products / avenues approved by the shariah board.

Under the above Mudaraba based pools, the Bank accepted funds on Mudaraba basis from depositors (Rabb–ul–Mal) where the Bank acted as Manager (Mudarib) and invested the funds in Shariah Compliant modes of financing, investments and placements. Also, as allowed, the Bank at its discretion comingled its own funds including current accounts as equity with the depositor’s funds in all the pools. However, for investment purposes, Rabb–ul–Mal’s funds were given priority over own funds (equity).

The net profit of each deposit pool is calculated on all the remunerative assets booked by utilizing the funds from the pool after deduction of direct expenses as approved by Shariah Board, if any. The directly related costs comprise of depreciation on Ijarah assets, Wakalah tul Istismar fee, Brokerage fee paid for placement of funds under Islamic modes, Takaful / Insurance expense, Registration expense and Commission to car Ijarah dealers, staff & others. Expected credit loss created against financing, investments and placements shall be borne by the Bank as Mudarib. However, write-offs of financing and loss on sale of investments shall be charged to respective pool(s) along with other direct expenses. ECL/write offs shall revert to Mudarib / pool(s) to which it was originally charged. From the net return, profit is paid to the Mudarib in the ratio of Mudarib’s equity in the pool to the total pool. The Mudarib’s share is deducted from this profit to calculate distributable profit. Rabb-ul-Mal’s share is distributed among depositors according to weightages assigned at the inception of profit calculation period.

In order to remain competitive in the industry and to retain existing customer / mobilize deposits from new customers, the Bank as a Mudarib distributed part of its share of profit to Rabb–ul–Mal as HIBA. Income generated from banking operations (e.g. fee and commission income etc.) is not shared with depositors. In case of loss in a pool during the profit calculation period, the loss is distributed among the depositors (remunerative) according to their ratio of Investments.

Notional Impact of IFRS-9 is not included in pool management.

# Following is the Key Audit Matter:

|S. No.|Key Audit Matters|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|Credit loss allowance against advances and off-balance sheet items|Refer to notes 10 and 22, and the accounting policy in note 5.1.2 to the consolidated financial statements. As at 31 December 2024, the Bank’s Credit loss allowance against advances and off-balance sheet items stands at Rs. 37,315 million and Rs. 756 million, respectively. As per the BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023, the Bank adopted requirements of IFRS 9 along with the Application Instructions issued by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) (hereafter referred to as “application instruction of IFRS 9”) from 1 January 2024 which requires the Bank to recognize Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on advances and off-balance sheet items. The estimation of ECL involves judgement and complexity. The key areas which are subject to complexity and judgement in the estimation of ECL are: - Model estimations – judgmental modelling and assumptions are used to estimate ECL which involves determining Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD). Respective models assumptions are key driver of uncertainty, and are required in the application of these model for calculation of ECL estimate.
- Economic scenarios – IFRS 9 requires the Bank to measure ECL on an unbiased forward-looking basis reflecting a range of future economic conditions. Complex Statistical methodology is applied in determining the forward-looking economic scenarios used as an input to calculate ECL, the associated scenario probability weightings, and the key economic variables that drive the scenarios.
- Qualitative criteria – the criteria selected to identify a SICR involves judgment and can lead to unreliable ECL recognized for certain portfolios.
Our audit procedures, amongst others, included the following: - Performing risk assessment procedures over the credit loss allowance against advances and off-balance sheet exposure within the Bank’s consolidated financial statement. As part of these risk assessment procedures, identifying the elements associated with risk of material misstatement on application including those arising from judgements over the estimation of ECL either due to, methods/models, assumptions or data.
- Assessing the design and implementation of key controls established by the Bank over measurement of ECL and provision calculated as per PR.
- We involved in-house specialist who assisted in the following: - Evaluating the Bank’s ECL model methodologies for compliance with application instructions of IFRS 9;
- Assessing the reasonableness of the Bank’s methodology for determining the economic scenarios used and the probability weightings applied to them by independently validating and challenging the assumption, methodologies, and outputs of the models;
- Assessing the reasonableness of macro-economic variables and economic forecasts by comparing these to external sourced data extracted;
- Performing independent testing of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) allowance on a sample basis.
- Assessing the appropriateness of SICR criteria applied by the Bank by ensuring that the SICR criteria and staging methodology are consistent with the application instructions of IFRS 9.
- Ensuring relevance and completeness of the key inputs into the ECL calculations with their respective sub-ledgers and general ledgers.
- Performing testing on sample basis over key inputs into the ECL calculations with their respective source documents.

|S. No.|Key Audit Matters|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|In line with the application instructions of IFRS 9, the Bank must compare the ECL for Stage 3 with the provision determined under the Prudential Regulations (PR) issued by the SBP. The PR requires specific provisioning against advances on the basis of time-based criteria which should be supplemented by a Bank’s subjective evaluation of credit worthiness of customers. The determination of provision, therefore, involves use of management’s judgement, on a case-to-case basis, taking into account factors such as the economic and business conditions, borrowers’ repayment behaviors and realizability of collateral held by the Bank. Because of the high degree of estimation uncertainty and complexity involved in the calculation of ECL we considered the area of ECL as a key audit matter.|- In accordance with the PR, we sampled at least sixty percent of the total advances outstanding exposure and performed credit reviews through the following substantive procedures:
- verifying repayments of principal and markup and checked that non-performing advances have been correctly classified and categorized based on the number of days overdue;
- examining watch list accounts and, based on review of the individual facts and circumstances, discussions with management and our assessment of financial conditions of the borrowers, formed a judgement as to whether classification of these accounts as performing was appropriate;
- assessing the accuracy of specific provision made against non-performing advances in accordance with the criteria prescribed under the PRs by performing recalculation.
- Assessing the appropriateness of ECL categorized as Stage 3 by performing a comparison of ECL computed, through the use of methodology and models with the provision required to be computed as required under the PR to ensure that an amount which is higher of the ECL and PR requirements is appropriately recognized for these stage 3 customers pursuant to the requirement of application instructions of IFRS 9.
- Evaluating the adequacy of the consolidated financial statement disclosures.

# Information Other than the Consolidated and Unconsolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Reports Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Group’s Annual Report but does not include the consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements and our auditors’ reports thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Chunk 390

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and, Companies Act, 2017 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

## Chunk 391

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is M. Rehan Chughtai.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with the approved accounting standards requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experiences, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The areas of assumptions and estimates which are significant to the Group’s financial statements or where judgment was exercised in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

- i) expected credit loss against financial instruments (note 5.1.13)
- ii) staff retirement benefits (note 5.12)
- iii) taxation (note 5.15)

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# 5.1 Changes in accounting policies

# 5.1.1 Revised format of consolidated financial statements

SBP through its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated 09 February 2023, has amended the format of annual financial statements of banks. All banks are required to prepare their annual financial statements on the revised format effective from accounting year starting from 01 January 2024. Accordingly, the Group has prepared these consolidated financial statements on the new format prescribed by SBP. The adoption of the new format contains additional disclosures and certain changes in the financial statements’ presentation, primarily due to the implementation of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan. However, the corresponding figures continue to be classified and disclosed in accordance with the previous financial accounting and reporting framework. Adoption of revised financial statements format has also resulted in following material changes (due to which the corresponding presentations have also been changed):

- Right–of–use–assets (note 12) amounting to Rs 12,196,186 thousand (December 31, 2023: Rs 8,312,812 thousand) which were previously shown as part of fixed assets are now shown separately on the consolidated statement of financial position.
- Lease liabilities (note 20) amounting to Rs 14,174,653 thousand (December 31, 2023: Rs 9,699,474 thousand) which were previously shown as part of other liabilities are now shown separately on the consolidated statement of financial position.

## Chunk 408

# 5.1.2 IFRS 9 – ‘Financial Instruments’

During the year, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9: ‘Financial Instruments’ (the Standard) became applicable to the Group. BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated 05 July 2022 issued by SBP provides detailed instructions on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks. The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘expected credit losses’ (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses’ approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

The Group has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions from 01 January 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognized in retained earnings and reserves as at 01 January 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard. Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9.

SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated 29 July 2024, has amended and extended the timelines for application instructions. Under the revised guidelines, banks are required to implement modification accounting for financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the Standard. These changes took effect from 01 October 2024, and have been applied retrospectively from 01 January 2024. SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 dated 22 January 2025, SBP further clarifies that modification accounting to be applied to loans modified on or after 01 January 2020.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

(b) Units of mutual funds and certain debt securities have contractual cash flows that do not meet the SPPI criteria. These assets are measured at FVTPL under IFRS 9 (AFS to FVTPL). Additionally, certain debt securities held by the Group in a transitory capacity, with the intent to pass them on to customers, fall under the “Held to Sell” business model and are also measured at FVTPL.

(c) Certain debt securities are held by the Group in separate portfolios to meet everyday liquidity needs. The Group seeks to minimise the costs of managing these liquidity needs and therefore actively manages the return on the portfolio. That return consists of collecting contractual payments as well as gains and losses from the sale of financial assets. The investment strategy often results in sales activity that is significant in value. The Group considers that under IFRS 9 these securities are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. Moreover, certain equity investments held by the Group have been designated under IFRS 9 as at FVOCI. (AFS to FVOCI).

(d) Debt securities that were previously classified as held–to–maturity are now classified at amortised cost. The Group intends to hold the assets to maturity to collect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist solely of payments of principal and profit on the principal amount outstanding. (HTM to AC).

(e) Advances except for Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), staff loans and modified financing are stated at cost. Whereas, Temporary economic refinance scheme, staff loans and modified financing are stated at amortized cost.

## Chunk 411

# 5.1.4 Impact on regulatory capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the Banks, which has reduced their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the Application Instructions issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement.

The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the “transitional adjustment amount”) must be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the “transition period” of five years. Moreover, SBP has allowed to adjust the amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions in Tier 2 Capital that have not been added back to CET 1 and vice versa as per Annexure A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024 dated 29 July 2024.

Had IFRS 9 been applied at 31 December 2023 then CAR would have been lower by 49 bps from 18.35% to 17.86%.

## Chunk 412

# 5.1.5 Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) regardless of the business model in which they are held.

Recognition and initial measurement Debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

194 Askari Bank Limited
---
A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at transaction price. The fair value of a financial asset on initial recognition is generally its transaction price. If the Group determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss account on an appropriate basis over the life of the asset but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data, or the transaction is closed out. Advances other than staff loans, Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations are initially measured at transaction price i.e., the amount of loan disbursed at disbursement date.

Staff loans, Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) loans and advances pertaining to overseas operations are recognized at fair value at the time of disbursement. The fair value is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using the prevailing market rates for instruments.

---

## Chunk 413

# Classification

# Financial Assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset excluding advances with the exception of staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations is classified as measured at amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment–by–investment basis.

Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in scope of the standard are never bifurcated. Instead, the whole hybrid instrument is assessed for classification.

Advances are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, excluding staff loans, Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations, which are measured at amortized cost.

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Bank changes its business models for managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following changes in the business model.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

IFRS 9 allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any ‘accounting mismatch’ that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different basis. SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout life of the instrument.

---

## Chunk 415

# Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognized in profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method. Markup expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit and loss.

---

## Chunk 416

# 5.1.6 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either Held to collect (HTC), Held to collect and Sell (HTC&S) and Held to Sell (HTS) based on business model assessment. The Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The assessment requires judgement based on facts and circumstances on the date of assessment. The assessment considers the policies and objectives for the portfolio of financial assets, risk affecting, performance evaluation, business manager’s compensation and historical sales information.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

---

## Chunk 417

# 5.1.7 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘Principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as interest margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Group considers:

- contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
- leverage features;
- prepayment and extension terms;
- terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non–recourse loans); and
- features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).

A prepayment feature aligns with SPPI if it mainly represents unpaid principal and profit, including reasonable compensation for early termination.
---
The Group holds a portfolio of long–term fixed–rate loans for which the Group has the option to propose to revise the interest rate at periodic reset dates. These reset rights are limited to the market rate at the time of revision. The borrowers have an option to either accept the revised rate or redeem the loan at par without penalty. The Group has determined that the contractual cash flows of these loan are SPPI because the option varies the interest rate in a way that is consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and costs associated with the principal amount outstanding.

# 5.1.8  Subsequent measurement

## Chunk 419

# 5.1.9  Amortised cost and gross carrying amount

The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount for investments and lendings to financial institution. For financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance or impairment allowance before 01 January 2024.

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

## Chunk 420

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# 5.1.10  Calculation of markup income and expense

Income from performing advances of the domestic operations is recognised on accrual basis as per the terms of the contract. However, where debt securities, classified as investments in the financial statements, are purchased at premium or discount, such premium / discount including the transaction cost is amortized through the consolidated statement of profit and loss account over the remaining maturity of the debt security using the effective interest rate method. The interest income on staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations is recognized in line with the EIR, while any expected credit losses are assessed and accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. Income from advances except for staff loans and TERF are recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss account using contractual rate. Similarly, under the local regulatory requirement, income recoverable on classified domestic advances and investments (debt securities), is recognized on a receipt basis. Income on rescheduled / restructured advances and investments is recognized as permitted by SBP regulations. In case of overseas operations, income on the financial assets is recognised under the effective interest method or as prescribed by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which the Group operates. Markup expense on domestic financial liabilities (comprising deposits, subordinated debts, and borrowings) is recognized on an accrual basis in the period in which it is incurred, based on contracted rates.

---

## Chunk 421

# 5.1.11  Derecognition

The Group derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognized), and the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in OCI is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, except that in case of the derecognition of equity securities held at FVOCI, cumulative gains or losses are transferred to unappropriated profit. The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

---

## Chunk 422

# 5.1.12  Modification

Financial assets The Group sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognized and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs.

198   Askari Bank Limited
---
If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

Where derecognition of financial assets is appropriate, the newly recognised residual loans are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classified as purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI). If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the bank first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective yield rate of the asset and recognised the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit and loss account.

If such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as profit income calculated using the effective yield rate method.

---

## Chunk 423

# 5.1.13 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (’12–month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’).

---

## Chunk 424

# Measurement of ECL

ECL is a probability–weighted estimate of credit losses. It is measured as follows:

- financial assets that are not credit–impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive);
- financial assets that are credit–impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows;

Annual Report 2024 199

## Chunk 425

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

– undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Group if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive; and

– financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Group expects to recover.

---

## Chunk 426

# Non–Performing financial assets

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost, at cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit-impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘non–performing’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit–impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- the restructuring of a loan by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit–impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit–impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.

Under SBP’s IFRS 9 application instructions, the Group is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. The Group is required to calculate ECL on its non–performing financial assets as higher of provision under Prudential Regulations (PR) and ECL under IFRS 9. Further, the Group recognizes income on impaired assets (loans classified under PRs i.e., OAEM and Stage 3 loans) on a receipt basis in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations issued by SBP.

The Group calculates the ECL against corporate, commercial, SME and retail loan portfolios as higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at borrower level.

ECL is a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses which is determined by multiplying the probability of default with the loss given default with the expected exposure at the time of default. Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 application instructions, the Group has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12- month ECL, Stage1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2). PD is estimated using internal rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk rating. The Group has used a statistical method for the estimation of Through the Cycle (TTC) PDs associated with each of its obligors risk rating. PD are then adjusted with forward looking information for calculation of ECL. Forward looking information is incorporated to convert TTC PD to Point in Time Probability of Default (PiT) PD. The Group has estimated PiT PDs in its PD model. For this purpose the Group incorporated five years forecast obtained from the Macro Economic Variable (MEV) database of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
- EAD: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant. The Group estimates EAD for financial assets carried at an amortised cost and carried at cost equal to principal.
---
plus profit. Each repayment date is assumed to be default point in the model and the ECL is calculated on EAD at each reporting date and discounted at the effective interest rate or contractual interest rate for advances other than staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations for which effective interest rate is used. The unutilized exposures are multiplied with credit conversion factors (CCF) to compute the EAD of revolving facilities. Additionally liquid collateral that the Bank holds are adjusted from the EAD and the ECL is computed on the net amount.

– LGD: An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. The Group estimates LGD based on actual recoveries from defaulted accounts over a historical period prior to the assessment date. Forward looking information is incorporated into the LGD calculation to reflect the impact of macro economic factors on the expected recoveries.

# Presentation of allowance for Expected Credit Loss in the consolidated Statement of Financial Position

Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position as follows:

- Financial assets measured at amortized cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets.
- For advances measured at cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the advances.
- Loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: as a provision in other liabilities.
- Where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Group does not identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component and instead presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision; and
- Debt instruments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance is recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value.

## Chunk 428

# 5.1.14 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Group used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

As required by the application instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PR issued by SBP. Financial assets in Stage 2 may be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum period of 6 months from initial downgrade is required before any facility is moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to move back from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it should meet the criteria defined under the respective Prudential Regulations for de–classification of account / facility. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure–C of BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022. However, banks are free to choose more stringent days past due criteria. The Group aligned its policy with Annexure–C of BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022; hence, SICR is considered if credit exposure exceeds 60 days past due.

# 5.1.15  Undrawn loan commitments and guarantees:

Financial guarantees are contracts that require the Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Loan commitments are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions.

When estimating lifetime ECL for undrawn loan commitments, the Group estimates the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the loans are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

## Chunk 430

# 5.1.16  Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Group has adopted a governance framework requiring multiple functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. The Risk Department defines the staging criteria for the new impairment model and takes ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach. Additionally, the Risk department also takes ownership of the impact of ECL on the Group’s capital.

The Group’s Finance Division performs ECL calculation. As a result, the department then assesses the financial impact, meets the financial reporting requirements and further monitors the impact on the financial ratios.

As per the Group’s policy, the Group’s Internal Audit function carries out periodic review of IFRS 9 methodology and impacts calculated by the management.

# 5.5.2 Islamic financing and related assets

Ijarahs booked under Islamic Financial Accounting Standard 2 – Ijarah (IFAS 2) are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment if any, and are shown under advances. Depreciation on Ijarah assets is charged to profit and loss account by applying the straight line method whereby the depreciable value of Ijarah assets is written off over the Ijarah period. The Group charges depreciation from the date of delivery of respective assets to Mustajir up to the date of maturity / termination of Ijarah agreement.

In Murabaha transactions, the Group purchases the goods through its agent or client and after taking the possession, sells them to the customer on cost plus profit basis either in a spot or credit transaction. Under Murabaha financing, funds disbursed for purchase of goods are recorded as ‘Advance against Murabaha finance’. On culmination of Murabaha i.e. sale of goods to customers, Murabaha financing is recorded at the deferred sale price. Goods purchased but remaining unsold at the statement of financial position date are recorded as inventories.

In Salam financing, the Group pays full in advance to its customer for buying specified goods / commodities to be delivered to the Group within an agreed time. The goods are then sold and the amount financed is received back by the Group along with profit.

In Musharaka a relationship is established under a contract by the mutual consent of the Group and the customer for sharing of profits and losses arising from a joint enterprise or venture.

Diminishing Musharaka (DM) is a form of co–ownership in which Bank and the customer share the ownership of a tangible asset in an agreed proportion and customer undertakes to buy in periodic installments the proportionate share of the Group until the title to such tangible asset is completely transferred to the customer. The rental payment is recognized as profit while the assets transfer / sale payments are applied towards reducing the outstanding principal.

In Istisna financing, the Group acquires the described goods to be manufactured by the customer from raw material of its own and deliver to the Group within an agreed time. The goods are then sold and the amount financed is received back by the Group along with profit.

In Running Musharaka based financing, the Group enters into financing with the customer based on Shirkat–ul–Aqd or Business Partnership in the customer’s operating business where the funds can be withdrawn or refunded during the Musharaka period.

The Group values its inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost necessary to make the sale. Cost of inventories represents actual purchases made by the Group / customers as an agent of the Group for subsequent sale. Inventory against each contract is maintained on specific identification method.

# Property and equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less impairment losses and accumulated depreciation except for freehold / leasehold land. Land is carried at revalued amounts which is not depreciated. Land is revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are taken to the profit and loss account.

Surplus arising on revaluation of fixed assets is credited to the surplus on revaluation of assets account and is shown under the shareholders’ equity in the consolidated statement of financial position. Except to the extent actually realized on disposal of land which are revalued, the surplus on revaluation of land shall not be applied to set–off or reduce any deficit or loss, whether past, current or future, or in any manner applied, adjusted or treated so as to add to the income, profit or surplus of the Group or utilized directly or indirectly by way of dividend or bonus.

## Chunk 437

# Intangible assets

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets are amortized from the month when these assets are available for use, using the straight line method, whereby the cost of the intangible assets are amortized over its estimated useful lives over which economic benefits are expected to flow to the Group. The useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.

---

## Chunk 438

# Depreciation / amortization

Depreciation / amortization is computed on monthly basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets at the rates set out in note 11.2 and 13.1 respectively on monthly basis. The cost of assets is depreciated / amortized on straight line basis, except for buildings which are depreciated on reducing balance method. Depreciation / amortization commences when the related asset is available for use and discontinues when the asset is disposed off or retired from the active use. Maintenance and normal repairs are charged to profit and loss account as and when incurred.

In making estimates of the depreciation / amortization, the management uses useful life and residual value which reflects the pattern in which economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Group. The useful life and the residual value are reviewed at each financial year end and any change in these estimates in future years might effect the carrying amounts of the respective item of operating fixed assets with the corresponding effect on depreciation / amortization charge.

## Chunk 439

# Assets held for sale

Non–current assets and associated liabilities are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use and a sale is highly probable. Assets designated as held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount at designation and fair value less costs to sell, if fair value can reasonably be determined.

## Chunk 440

# IFRS 16 – Leases

A lessee recognizes a right–of–use (ROU) asset representing its right of using the underlying asset and a corresponding lease liability representing its obligations to make lease payments.

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payment, discounted using the Group’s contract wise incremental borrowing rate. The lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost.
---
using the effective interest rate method. The lease liability is also remeasured to reflect any reassessment or change in lease terms. These remeasurements of lease liabilities are recognised as adjustments to the carrying amount of related ROU assets after the date of initial recognition.

Each lease payment is allocated between a reduction of the liability and a finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the profit and loss account as markup expense over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

The ROU assets are initially measured based on the initial amount of the lease liability plus any initial direct costs incurred. ROU assets are subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation. The ROU assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term as this method most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits. The estimated useful lives of ROU assets are determined on the same basis as that used for owned assets. The ROU assets are reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of lease liability.

# 5.9 Borrowings (Repo)

|These represent certain claims by third parties against the Group, which are being contested in the Courts of law. Based on legal advice and / or internal assessment, management is confident that the matters will be decided in Group’s favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Group is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these consolidated financial statements|474,328|596,911|

|26 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS| | |
|The Group at present does not offer derivative products such as Interest Rate Swaps, Cross Currency Swaps, Forward Rate Agreements or Foreign Exchange Options. The Bank’s Treasury and Investment Banking Groups buy and sell derivative instruments such as Forward Exchange Contracts (FECs) and Equity Futures (EFs).| | |
|26.1 Forward exchange contracts (FECs)| | |
|FECs is a product offered to clients to hedge FX risk. The traders use this product to hedge themselves from unfavourable movements in a foreign currency, however, by agreeing to fix the exchange rate, they do not benefit from favourable movements in that currency.| | |
|FECs is a contract between the obligor and the Group in which both agree to exchange an amount of one currency for another currency at an agreed forward exchange rate for settlement over more than two business days after the FECs is entered into (the day on which settlement occurs is called the value date). FECs is entered with those obligors whose credit worthiness has already been assessed, and they have underlined trade transactions.| | |
|If the relevant exchange rate moves un–favourably, the Group will lose money, and obligor will benefit from that movement because the Group must exchange currencies at the FEC rate. In order to mitigate this risk of adverse exchange rate movement, the Group manages its exposure by hedging forward position in inter–bank foreign exchange.| | |

# 26.2  Equity futures

An equity futures contract is a standardized contract, traded on a futures counter of the stock exchange, to buy or sell a certain underlying scrip at a certain date in the future, at a specified price.

The Group uses equity futures as a hedging instrument to hedge its equity portfolio against equity price risk. Only selected shares are allowed to be traded on futures exchange as determined by the Exchange.

Equity futures give flexibility to the Group either to take delivery on the future settlement date or to settle it by adjusting the notional value of the contract based on the current market rates.

Maximum exposure limit to the equity futures is 10% of Tier I Capital of the Group, based on prevailing SBP regulations.

The Risk Management Group monitors the Bank’s exposure in equity futures and forward exchange contracts. Positions in equity futures and forward exchange contracts are marked–to–market. Forward contracts are included in measures of portfolio volatility including Value at Risk (VaR). Forward exchange contracts and equity futures are also included in capital charge and Risk Weighted Asset calculation in accordance with SBP regulations.

The accounting policies used to recognize and disclose derivatives are given in note 5.21.

# 35.2 Tax status and contingencies

i) During the year ended 31 December 2023, the Federal Government issued S.R.O 1588 (l)/2023 on 21 November 2023 under section 99D of the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, whereby the banking sector was specified the sector for the payment of additional tax on windfall income. Through said S.R.O, the Federal Government also specified the method to determine windfall income, tax rate to be applied on such windfall income and tax years under scope. The Group has challenged the S.R.O through petition before the Honorable Islamabad High Court with regards to retrospective application of Section 99D of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for tax years 2022 and 2023. The Honorable Islamabad High Court through its order dated 30 November 2023 has suspended the operation of S.R.O.1588 (l)/2023 and the said injunctive order continues to operate till date of next hearing for which no date has been fixed yet. Management based on the legal advisor opinion believes that the Group has reasonably good chance to succeed in this case and therefore has not recognized any provision in the financial statements. Additional tax on windfall income for tax years 2022 and 2023 is estimated to be Rs. 2,189 million.

ii) The Group has filed tax returns for and up to tax year 2024. The assessments for and up to tax year 2023 were amended by the tax authorities creating accumulated additional tax demand, mainly in the matters of admissibility of recoveries against doubtful debts for Rs 1,119 million, provision for diminution in the value of investments for Rs 3,144.44 million, bad debts written off for Rs 242.892 million, provision for substandard advances for Rs 74.95 million, Provision against other assets/fixed assets for Rs 145.81 million, disallowance of employee benefit expenses Rs 228.680 million, disallowance of depreciation on lease assets Rs 773.88 and other disallowances of expenses/credits for Rs 551.78 million. The Group’s Appeals against these orders are currently pending before Commissioner Appeals, Appellate Tribunal and Islamabad High Court. The management and tax advisor of the Group are confident that these matters will be decided in favor of the Group and consequently no provision has been made thereon. Tax payments by the Group against certain matters are being carried forward as receivable, as management and tax advisor of the Group are confident of their realization.

iii) Consequent upon the amalgamation with and into the Group, the outstanding tax issues relating to Askari Leasing Limited (ALL) are as follows: Tax returns of ALL have been filed for and up to tax year 2010. The returns for the tax years 2003 to 2010 were amended by the tax authorities mainly in the matter of admissibility of initial allowance claimed on leased vehicles. On appeals filed by ALL, partial relief was provided by the CIR(A) by allowing initial allowance on commercial vehicles. Re–assessment has not yet been carried out by the tax department. A tax demand is however not likely to arise after re–assessment. For and up to the assessment years 2002–2003, reference applications filed by the tax authorities in the matter of computation of lease income are pending decisions by the High Court. However, the likelihood of an adverse decision is considered low due to a favorable decision of the High Court in a parallel case.

# 39.15 Significant risk associated with the staff retirement benefit scheme:

Longevity Risks: The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population.

Salary Increase Risk: The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the benefit is linked with final salary. The risk arises when the actual increases are higher than expectation and impacts the liability accordingly.

Withdrawal Risk: The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

# 43 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as Amortised Cost, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified under held to collect are carried at amortised cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break–up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term advances, fixed term deposits and borrowings, other assets and other liabilities cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.
---

---

## Chunk 542

# 43.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) available at Mutual Fund Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) and Reuters page.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# CAPITAL ADEQUACY, LEVERAGE RATIO & LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS

The objective of managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it could continue to provide adequate returns to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk. It is the policy of the Group to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Group recognises the need to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with greater exposure and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.

Under the current scenario, the Banks are under pressure to extend further credit to its borrowers, while overall deteriorating credit risk and increased NPL may also put additional pressures on the Group from Capital Adequacy Ratio perspective. The SBP has relaxed the Capital Conversion Buffer (CCB) requirements for the banks to 1.5%, resulting in an overall CAR requirement of 11.5%. In addition to the measures by SBP, the Group is continuously monitoring the impacts of various decisions of its CAR and taking further lending decisions based on the overall impacts on Risk Weighted Assets (RWA). The Group also believes that it has sufficient buffer in its CAR requirement to meet any adverse movements in credit, market or operational risks.

# 48 RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group believes that effective risk management is key to achieving desired level of return while maintaining acceptable level of risk exposure. Robust risk management processes and framework are in place to achieve the Group’s overall objectives through a well thought out strategy, which enables the Group to effectively manage Credit, Market, Operational and Liquidity risk in a proactive manner.

The Group’s approach is to ensure that risk management is deeply and firmly embedded in the culture of the Group. All employees are therefore considered responsible for identification, measurement, monitoring and controlling risks within the scope of their assigned responsibilities. As a result of changing risk environment, the Group continuously monitors and conducts holistic assessment of complex transactions on an integrated basis.

The Group has a Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) in place and is updated regularly by the Group’s Risk Management Group. BRMC is responsible for reviewing the extent of design and adequacy of the risk management framework. BRMC oversight ensures that risks are managed within the level of tolerance and risk appetite of the Group.

## Chunk 559

# 48.1 Credit Risk:

Credit risk arises from the potential that an obligor is either unwilling to perform on an obligation or its ability is impaired resulting in economic loss to the Group. The Group takes necessary measures to control such risk by establishing minimum standards and rules for booking credit exposures and subsequently, by monitoring these exposures – limiting transactions with specific counter parties with increased likelihood of default and continually assessing creditworthiness of its obligors.

The Group has built and maintains a sound loan portfolio in line with a well defined Credit Policy approved by the Board of Directors. Its credit evaluation system comprises well-designed credit appraisal, sanctioning and review procedures for the purpose of emphasizing prudence in its lending activities and ensuring quality of asset portfolio. Advances portfolio constitutes around 28% of the total asset base and is also the largest source of credit risk for the Group. The Group’s advances portfolio is well diversified across various business segments and industries. The Group employs a robust Credit Risk Rating model that systematically assigns ratings to obligors based on assessment of their quantitative and qualitative factors.

Risk mitigants have been put in place at all stages of credit risk cycle i.e. identification, measurement, monitoring, controlling and reporting for effective credit risk management. Accordingly, portfolio monitoring function is in place with dedicated resources to ensure that the risk is effectively monitored and reported.

Credit Risk Review is conducted at obligor as well as at portfolio level to ensure adherence to regulatory requirement as well as internal policies and procedures. The review process ensures that a sound and proactive risk management culture is maintained across the Group. Credit is approved under the 4 eye principal with equal ownership from both Business functions and Risk Management Group (RMG). Audit (Risk Assets Review) division reviews the advances portfolio on a post approval basis.

The Group has undertaken a number of initiatives to strengthen its credit risk management framework including in–house development of internal risk rating models (obligor and facility) for the portfolio for respective segments, and transition and migration matrices to study the realized default rates and performance of the risk rating models over the years.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

Keeping in view the deteriorating economic situation, Rapid Portfolio Reviews are performed to identify vulnerable accounts and decide account specific strategies with respect to exposure and to estimate possible additional provisioning. Results of the Rapid Portfolio Reviews are shared with senior management and Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC).

Provision for expected credit losses is determined in accordance with the SBP’s requirements and IFRS 9. Stress testing for credit risk is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of increase in non-performing loans and to ensure that CAR is maintained at sufficient level to meet regulatory requirement and business needs.

The Group has implemented an Enterprise Risk Management solution and Loan Origination System. These systems not only enhance operational efficiency in the risk management processes, but also promote integrated risk assessment.

Risk Asset Review (RAR) performs an independent review of the credit portfolio. It provides an independent assessment of portfolio quality, efficacy of processes for acquisition of risk assets, regulatory/policy compliance and appropriateness of classification and risk rating.

A centralized Credit Administration Division (CAD) under Operations Group is working to ensure that terms and conditions of approval of credit sanctions are complied, all documentation is complete and fully enforceable, all disbursements of approved facilities are made only after necessary authorization by CAD and collateral is monitored on regular basis. Cash, deposits under lien, Government securities and eligible guarantees etc. are considered as eligible collateral.

To handle the specific needs of managing classified accounts, the Group has a separate Special Asset Management Division (SAMD) to negotiate settlement of the non-performing exposure, including pursuing litigation, if required, to protect the interests of the depositors and shareholders.

# 48.1.1 Credit risk - General disclosures

The Group follows the Standardized Approach for its credit risk exposures, which sets out fixed risk weights corresponding to external credit ratings or type of exposure, whichever is applicable.

Under the Standardized Approach, the capital requirement is based on the credit rating assigned to counterparties by External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) duly recognized by the SBP. The Group selects particular ECAIs for each type of exposure. The Group utilizes the credit ratings assigned by Pakistan Credit Rating Agency (PACRA), Japan Credit Rating Company Limited – Vital Information Systems (JCR-VIS), Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poors (S&P).

# 48.1.8 Forward–looking information contained in ECL

The Group’s Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculation incorporates forward–looking information by integrating
macroeconomic variables to enhance the accuracy and reliability of credit risk estimates. The use of forward–
looking data helps in better predicting potential credit losses under different economic conditions.

To estimate Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD), the Group utilizes historical and forecasted
macroeconomic data. For ECL calculations, the Group considers Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer
Price Index (CPI), unemployment, exports and imports as the primary macroeconomic variables, with forecasted
data sourced from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The selection of these variables is based on their
relevance and sensitivity to specific portfolios.

The Group has developed three macroeconomic scenarios—Base, Best, and Worst—to reflect potential economic
conditions. These scenarios have been assigned probability weightings of 68% for the Base scenario, 16% for the
Best scenario, and 16% for the Worst scenario to ensure a comprehensive assessment of credit risk exposure.

As part of its forward–looking assessment, the Group conducted a sensitivity analysis on macroeconomic
indicators used in Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculations. As of December 31, 2024, the Group developed three
scenarios—Base, Best, and Worst—based on a five–year forecast. A 10% change in macroeconomic variables
mentioned above in the weighted average scenario was applied to assess the upside and downside impact on
ECL. The resulting variations are as follows:

| |Upwards|Downwards|
|---|---|---|
|Expected credit loss allowance|3.71%|(1.18%)|

---

## Chunk 569

# Sensitivity of ECL to Future Economic Conditions

The ECL are sensitive to judgements and assumption made regarding formulation of forward–looking scenarios
and how much such scenarios are incorporated into calculations. The Group performs sensitivity analysis on the
ECL.

The table below shows the loss allowance assuming each forward–looking scenario (e.g. Base, Best and Worst)
were weighted 100% instead of applying scenario probability across the three scenarios.

| |Base|Best|Worst|
|---|---|---|---|
|Total ECL as per FS|39,661,264|37,465,987|44,782,919|

# 48.2 Market Risk

Market risk is the risk that the value of on and off–balance sheet positions of a financial institution will be adversely affected by movements in market rates or prices such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and credit spreads, resulting in a loss to earnings and capital.

The Group is exposed to market risk from both its banking and trading books. Trading book for the Group includes all Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL) securities along with Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) securities that are held with intention of short term trade. All assets not included in trading book are included in the Banking book.

The Group’s Risk Management Process seeks to identify, measure, monitor, and control market risks in order to shield against adverse movements in market factors and to attain an efficient risk / return profile of its open positions. Risk Management Group has developed and implemented market risk policy and risk measurement / monitoring methodology for review and reporting of market risk.

The Group makes use of the globally established Value–at–Risk (VaR) methodology to measure traded market risk. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is carried out to gauge the impact of extreme market movements on traded exposures, such as fixed income securities and equity capital market instruments.

Further, stress testing is used to analyze the impact of abnormal market movements across different portfolios to assess non–traded market risk, in particular interest rate risk in the banking book. The performance of the Group’s traded portfolios is evaluated through the use of risk / return analysis. Risk is assessed through the revaluation of all traded market risk exposed positions on a daily basis, and monitored by ensuring that these positions do not breach any regulatory limits as well as any internally established risk tolerance limits.

Basel III Standardized Approach is used for calculating the Capital Adequacy for Market Risk. Total capital charge for market risk is Rs. 79,295,220 thousand (2023: Rs. 29,300,677 thousand).

# 48.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk, or the risk that the Group’s earnings and / or capital can fluctuate due to changes in foreign
exchange rates, arises out of the Group’s foreign exchange exposure which consists of foreign currency cash
in hand, nostro / vostro accounts, forward contracts, forward bookings with exporters, foreign bills purchased,
foreign currency placements with SBP and the Group’s Wholesale Bank Branch, foreign currency lendings /
deposits and capital investments in offshore operations.

The Group’s treasury manages consolidated foreign exchange exposure by matching foreign currency assets
and liabilities in spot and forward. The foreign exchange exposure and nostro balances are maintained within
regulatory limits and VaR is calculated for consolidated foreign exchange exposure on a daily basis. The impact
of a change in USD / PKR parity on the net open position is also determined through daily sensitivity analysis.

# 48.2.3 Equity position risk

Equity position risk is the risk that the value of equity positions inside the trading book and banking book will
change as a result of general and specific equity market movements. Equity positions are monitored on daily
basis through management action triggers.

The Group classifies its direct equity investments into Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL), Fair Value
Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), and Amortized Cost (AC). FVTPL exposures are of a short
term nature and are undertaken to earn profit by exploiting market conditions and short term price fluctuations.
Equities held in the FVOCI portfolio are kept with the intent of earning profit due to underlying fundamental
strength of each security. Strategic investments are undertaken in line with the long–term strategy of the Group,
i.e. to build strategic interest in other concerns. The Group may also carry indirect equity exposure through
financing against shares and reverse repos against shares.

# 48.2.4 Yield / Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)–Basel III Specific

The Group’s interest rate exposure arises out of its investment, lending and borrowing activities. Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) in its various forms is the risk of adverse changes in earnings and/or capital due to (i) timing differences or mismatches in the maturity/repricing period of financial assets and liabilities (repricing risk), (ii) differences in the basis used for calculating interest rates received and paid (basis risk), (iii) and options implicit or explicit in the Group’s financial assets and liabilities (options risk). The Asset and Liability Management Committee of the Group monitors and controls mismatch of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis through its regular meetings. The Market Risk Management Department monitors interest rate in the banking book from an earnings and economic value perspective.

Key IRRBB measures include:

1. Interest Earnings at Risk (IAR): the rolling 12–month impact of a parallel shift in interest rates on Net Interest Margin.
2. Change in Economic Value of Equity (EVE): the impact of a parallel shift in interest rates on the present value of the Group’s cash flows.
3. Repricing Gaps: mismatch between the Group’s assets and liabilities in terms of repricing time bands based on residual maturity for repricing or actual maturity whichever is earlier. Repricing assumptions for non–contractual assets and liabilities have been set based on a behavioral study.

# Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk reflects an enterprises inability in raising funds to meet commitments. The Group’s liquidity position is managed by the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). ALCO monitors the maintenance of financial position, liquidity ratios, depositors concentration both in terms of the overall funding mix and to avoid undue reliance on large individual deposits. Moreover, core retail deposits (current accounts and saving accounts) form a considerable part of the Group’s overall funding and significant importance is attached to the stability and growth of these deposits.

The Group is confident that the liquidity buffer currently maintained is sufficient to cater to any adverse movement in the cash flow maturity profile.
