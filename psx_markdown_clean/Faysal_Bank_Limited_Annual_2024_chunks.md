# Key Message from the Chairman

Dear valued shareholders, customers and stakeholders,

It is my pleasure to present to you the annual financial report of Faysal Bank Limited (FBL), a leading Islamic financial institution, for the year 2024. This is our second report after having been licensed as an Islamic financial entity. This report highlights the Bank’s achievements, challenges, and future prospects, demonstrating its commitment to overall excellence, innovations in different segments and Shariah-compliant banking.

Our transformative journey has been a continuous process marked by significant milestones. Our Total assets have grown by 14% to reach Rs1,565 billion, which is Alhamdulillah a decent accomplishment. Our Profit Before Tax also showed a substantial rise of 22%, reflecting our focus on operational efficiency, cost optimisation, and innovative financial solutions. The Bank has achieved significant growth in customer loyalty as reflected in our business success and the strong improvement in Net Promoters Score (NPS).

The Bank has been recognised by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) as the fastest-growing Bank in the country’s remittance market under its Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI). The award was presented at the 4th Pakistan Remittance Summit, held in the second week of December 2024, in Rome, Italy. This award highlights our excellence and growing leadership in the remittance sector, reflecting the trust and confidence placed in the Bank by its valued customers both in Pakistan and abroad.

The Bank’s network of branches expanded to 855, with the addition of 133 branches during the year 2024. That is MashaAllah an overall addition of 279 branches in the last 5 years, and we are hopeful of reaching the mark of 1000 branches in the near future. Working with an expansionary strategic model, the objective is to simultaneously achieve strong growth in volumes and revenues, with cost discipline, and maintenance of efficiency ratios.

Committed to excellence, we continue to strengthen our position in the industry through dedicated efforts and a strong market presence. With continued blessings of Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala, we hope to reach the top 5 mark with consistent effort of our diligent teams.

The year 2024 has also been a year of change for the banking sector as a shift from deposit-led to asset-led business model was witnessed. Crucial challenges were faced by the banks, which included subdued economic growth, low Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and policy rate reduction from 22% to 13% in December 2024. Despite these challenges, the Bank achieved its 2024 strategy/ budget targets. The ADR was comfortably above 50%.

As a pioneering Islamic Bank, we remain dedicated to upholding the principles of Shariah in all our transactions, ensuring that our operations are not only financially rewarding but also socially responsible and ethically sound. Our Shariah Supervisory Board continues to provide guidance and oversight, ensuring that our products and services meet the highest standards of Shariah compliance.

During the year, we launched several key initiatives aimed at enhancing customer experience, expanding our digital presence, and strengthening risk management framework. These efforts have positioned us for sustained growth and improved competitiveness in the market.

We continued to invest in digital transformation, upgrading our online banking platform, mobile applications, and payment systems to provide a seamless and secure experience for our customers. Our digital channels have seen significant growth, with 66% increase in internet & mobile banking transactions and 34% rise in mobile banking subscribers.

Faysal Bank remains committed to promoting financial inclusion and economic development in our communities. Our SME programmes have empowered numerous business owners, while our Islamic finance training programmes have enhanced capacity building and knowledge retention / sharing.

Over the year, our risk management framework has been significantly strengthened by enhancing credit risk assessment, liquidity management, and compliance systems. Risk management strategies have enabled the Bank to navigate challenging market conditions and maintain a strong capital adequacy ratio.

Guided by our Islamic values, we prioritised initiatives that benefit communities and promote sustainability. We managed to allocate PKR 141 million, to support educational, health and other corporate social responsibility programmes and initiatives, and hope to do more in the years ahead. The Bank has partnered with charitable organisations to deliver relief to the less privileged segment of the society. To further consolidate our initiatives, and enhance impact, we set up Board’s Sustainability and Development Committee (BSDC). BSDC will define/review the sustainability strategy and framework, and align it with national sustainability strategy for future.

As we celebrate another successful year, we reaffirm our commitment to Islamic banking principles and our role in promoting financial inclusion and economic development along.
---
with the achievement of prime objectives pertaining to Climate & Environmental Social Governance (ESG).

Looking ahead, strategic goals have been prepared in the Strategy document for the period of 2025-2028. We are optimistic about the future prospects of the Bank, with our strategic focus on further diversifying our product offerings. Conforming to the digital age, we will continue to invest in technology, and expand our presence in key markets.

Keeping in view the challenges of policy rate reduction, narrowing margin, and an increased minimum profit rate for depositors, the Bank remains committed to creating long-term value for its shareholders while making a positive impact on the communities it serves.

I extend my deepest gratitude to our shareholders and employees for their confidence and unwavering support. To our customers, I sincerely extend my gratitude for their loyalty and trust in our services. My appreciation also goes to the Shariah Supervisory Board for their wisdom and guidance, ensuring our adherence to Islamic principles. Lastly, I also thank my fellow Board members for their guidance and oversight.

Thank you.

Sincerely Yours,

Mian Muhammad Younis

Chairman, Board of Directors

# Strategy Development Process

Faysal Bank’s strategic direction has been shaped by a comprehensive five-year corporate strategy, initially formulated for the period 2018–2023, through which the bank achieved targeted results. Building upon the foundation of this plan, a revised five-year strategy has been developed in collaboration with local and international consultants which covers the period 2024–2028. This strategy outlines the bank's medium and long-term priorities, sets clear operating frameworks and their associated financial objectives. Additionally, it highlights key organizational priorities and introduces a phased, milestone-based implementation approach, accompanied by well-defined key performance indicators (KPIs) to ensure effective execution and measurability of progress.

The implementation of the corporate strategy is carried out through a well-defined four-stage process. This begins with a comprehensive environmental analysis to assess external and internal factors influencing operations. Opportunities for growth and value creation are then identified, laying the foundation for informed decision-making. Execution of the implementation phase is conducted meticulously, ensuring that strategies are effectively translated into actionable initiatives. Progress is closely monitored using pre-defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), enabling the Bank to track outcomes and make timely adjustments to achieve its objectives efficiently.

# PESTEL Analysis

# Political:

Pakistan went through the process of general elections in 2024, resulting in a smooth transfer of power and improved political stability. Although the banking sector has demonstrated resilience, the overall sectoral performance remains closely tied to the broader economic climate. Key decisions by stakeholders on economic reforms, particularly those relating to banking regulation, fiscal policies, and tax reforms, have a direct impact on the bank's operations. Faysal Bank, like other financial institutions, continuously adjusts its strategies to accommodate shifts in policymaking.

## Chunk 99

# Economic:

Pakistan’s economy in 2024 was marked by a recovery phase after it successfully signed the 25th IMF EFF of US$7 Billion. Inflation recorded year on year decreased from 29.40% in June 2023 to 12.57% in June 2024, reaching 4.1% in Dec 2024. Inflation has now been in single digits for the past couple of months, which has also resulted in monetary easing by the SBP from an interest rate of 22% to 13%, a significant reduction in policy rate of 900 basis points. Measures by the SBP to curb illicit foreign exchange flows and establishment of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) to promote Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) were positive steps that have helped stabilize the economy. By December 2024, Pakistan’s overall foreign exchange reserves have risen to USD 16 billion, and the PKR has maintained stability at around Rs 277-279 per USD.

While the decrease in policy rate directly impacts Faysal Banks spreads, the Bank is focusing on its core strengths and continues to drive operational efficiencies, ensuring continued resilience. The Bank remains ready to capitalize on emerging opportunities which are now surfacing with the improvement in business sentiment and will continue to position its balance sheet in an optimal manner given the external environment.

# Competitive Landscape and Market Positioning

Customers are increasingly drawn to banks that offer better digital experiences, competitive rates, and personalized services. This power is particularly pronounced among high-net-worth individuals, whose larger deposits and transactions significantly impact a bank’s profitability. Mass retail customers, while having lower individual influence, collectively drive demand for user-friendly services and efficient banking solutions. Faysal Bank counters this by continuously improving its digital offerings, such as mobile and online banking, and by tailoring its products to meet the specific needs of its diverse customer base.

Competition within Pakistan’s banking sector is intense, driven by the dominance of large players with significant resources and extensive well-seasoned branch networks and well-established brands.

With Faysal Bank's transformation into a full-fledged Islamic Bank, the risk of Shariah non-compliance has become a significant concern in its day-to-day operations.

In 2024, Pakistan witnessed continuity in the political setup following the general elections which were held in February. While economic vulnerabilities persisted, stability in the global commodity market and easing supply chain disruptions kept import costs under check which supported domestic recovery efforts. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) adopted an easing stance on the monetary policy, reducing its benchmark discount rate from 22% to 13% over the year to stimulate growth—an adjustment facilitated by a decline in inflation. Meanwhile, the PKR/USD exchange rate consolidated, supported by improved remittances inflows and financial assistance from multilateral partners, due to which SBP’s foreign exchange reserves increased to $11.73 bln (increasing from $8.2 bln as of Dec-23). Overall Fx reserves increased to $15.93 bln from $12.67 bln a year earlier, providing a reasonable buffer against external shocks.

Despite these developments, structural challenges persist. Limited export diversification, delays in public-sector reforms, high external debt obligations, and the ongoing privatization process under the IMF facility continue to test the government’s economic strategy. Against this backdrop, Faysal Bank adopted a prudent growth strategy, successfully expanding its deposit and financing base while growing its branch network nationwide. In the pursuit of growth over the past year, our emphasis stayed on actively monitoring assets by keeping abreast with changing economic trends and market scenario. The Bank effectively implemented capital and liquidity management tools, managed Shariah non-compliance risks, introduced new products with focus on digitization and enhanced service quality.

Going forward, on a macroeconomic level, sustaining economic stability will require a careful balance between monetary easing and fiscal consolidation to manage inflationary pressures and external vulnerabilities. Structural reforms in taxation, energy pricing, and governance will be critical in strengthening investor confidence and attracting foreign direct investment. However, given limited fiscal flexibility, GDP and large-scale manufacturing growth are expected to remain subdued in the near term.

One of the key concerns of today’s era is climate change, which presents both risks and opportunities for Faysal Bank. Physical risks, including extreme weather events and resource scarcity, can impact asset valuations and operational resilience. Additionally, transition risks—arising from regulatory shifts, technological advancements, and evolving market preferences—may necessitate a review of financing and investment strategies. However, these challenges also present opportunities, such as expanding green financing, supporting climate-resilient businesses, and integrating sustainability into product offerings.

In the year 2025, with these challenges in mind, Faysal Bank aims to further strengthen its risk management framework, enhance digital banking capabilities, and drive financial inclusion through innovative Shariah-compliant products. Moreover, by embedding climate risk considerations in decision-making, the Bank aims to mitigate climate risks, navigate evolving regulatory landscapes and contribute to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy. The Bank will continue to align its strategic direction with evolving regulatory requirements and market dynamics while fostering sustainable growth and long-term value creation.

# Internal Risks and Opportunities

The bank continuously managed internal risks while seizing opportunities to enhance its operational efficiency and market position. Key internal risks include process inefficiencies that disrupt service delivery and impact on customer satisfaction, as well as posing challenges in maintaining a skilled workforce in a competitive talent market. On the opportunity side, the bank focused on leveraging technology to improve process automation and data analytics, which enhanced decision-making and customer engagement. Additionally, by fostering a culture of continuous learning and development, the bank mitigated the risk of skill gaps and positioned itself as an attractive employer, attracting top talent and driving innovation from within.

Faysal Bank is strategically positioned to capitalize on digital transformation opportunities by investing in AI technologies, which promise to enhance operational efficiency, improve customer service, and expand market share, thus driving increased profitability and capital availability. The bank is also diversifying its product portfolio with green financing and innovative digital banking solutions to attract new demographics and build sustainable revenue streams. Concurrently, the bank faces inherent risks in these endeavors, including the rapid pace of technological change that could outpace its adoption capabilities, and the potential regulatory challenges associated with new financial products. By continuously investing in employee training and development, Faysal Bank aims to bolster its workforce's ability to navigate these challenges, thereby improving overall operational performance and capital efficiency.

# External Risks and Opportunities

Economic downturns and increasing competition from fintechs present challenges to Faysal Bank which can impact market share and profitability. However, these challenges also drive innovation within the bank, leading to opportunities for growth and differentiation. Geopolitical risks and environmental changes prompt the bank to strengthen its crisis management capabilities and sustainability initiatives, further solidifying its commitment to corporate responsibility.

Faysal Bank is well-positioned to seize opportunities in the burgeoning field of sustainable and green financing. By offering ESG-focused products, the bank not only attracts a broader range of institutional investors and eco-conscious customers but also aligns itself with global sustainability goals, enhancing its corporate image. Regulatory incentives for green investments reduce costs and improve profitability, while partnerships with fintech firms and tech startups allow Faysal Bank to tap into cutting-edge technologies and expand into new customer segments.

The ESRM procedures provide detailed guidance for conducting environmental and social assessments and due diligence across the financing portfolio. The procedures include an applicability matrix, exclusion criteria, and a checklist to help Business and Risk teams evaluate potential environmental and social issues associated with financing.

Islamic tradition reflects a profound philosophy of Khidmat (Care), emphasising service to both the Creator and His creation. Rooted in this principle, we integrate the value of Care into our operations, ensuring ethical practices that address modern economic needs while remaining true to our values. At Faysal Bank, the value of Care lies at the heart of everything we do. Care signifies compassion, responsibility, and commitment to the well-being of individuals and communities. It drives us to go beyond financial services and contribute meaningfully to society. Whether it is through empowering communities, supporting education, promoting environmental sustainability, or advancing financial inclusion, we believe that Care serves as the foundation for long-term, positive impact. By embedding this principle into our culture and operations, we aim to create an ecosystem that fosters trust, inclusivity, and shared prosperity for all.

For the Bank, CSR is not just a commitment—it is a way of life that drives meaningful impact in the communities we serve and beyond.

The programme is designed to align with our corporate values and mission, focusing on financial inclusion and literacy, education and youth empowerment, health and wellness, and environmental sustainability. Each pillar represents a strategic area where our employees contribute their time and expertise to create lasting change.

Financial inclusion and literacy address the challenges of Pakistan's largely undocumented economy and a significant unbanked population.

Furthering this initiative under the Faysal Islami Financial Literacy Programme, the Bank has partnered with The Citizen’s Foundation to conduct workshops for its students. These workshops empower students with an understanding of Riba-free and Shariah-compliant banking products.

# Enterprise Resource Planning

How it is designed to manage and integrate the functions of core business processes/modules like finance, HR, supply chain and inventory management in a single system;

An ERP system consists of software components, or modules, each of which focuses on a distinct business process. ERP is distinguished from standalone applications by its central database that records information from the business transactions and other actions carried out in the modules, and by integration that allows the modules to communicate with each other and with the common database. In Faysal Bank we are using ERP for procure to pay cycle, fixed assets recording and corporate financial reporting.

# Statement on Internal Controls

This statement is presented to comply with the instructions of fostering a robust internal control environment. Additionally, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) issued vide BSD Circular No. 07 dated May 27, 2004, “Guidelines on Internal Controls” and OSED Circular No. 01 dated February 07, 2014, “Instructions on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR)”.

The Management of Faysal Bank Limited is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate and effective internal control system in the Bank. In this context, the Management has designed the Bank’s Internal Control Program to provide reasonable assurance on the reliability of financial reporting, the effectiveness of operations, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Although the Internal Control Program is effectively implemented and monitored, there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system, including the possibility of human error, system failure, circumvention, and overriding of controls. Even an effective internal control system can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that the system’s objectives will be achieved.

Policies and procedures covering diverse business and operational domains are meticulously crafted, continuously updated, and effectively communicated across all relevant levels of the organization. These policies receive formal approval from the Bank’s Board of Directors (BoD), while the procedures are sanctioned by the Senior Management. The Bank’s internal audit function plays a pivotal role in ensuring adherence to these policies and procedures, conducting rigorous compliance monitoring. Regular updates and compliance reports are provided to the Management and the BoD through the Board’s Audit and Corporate Governance Committee, ensuring ongoing oversight and governance.

The Bank has completed all stages of the ICFR roadmap, issued vide SBP’s BSD Circular No. 05 dated February 24, 2009. The Bank has adopted the “COSO Internal Control Integrated Framework” in relation to its Internal Control Program to ensure consistency in the process of compliance with SBP’s Internal Control Guidelines involving documentation, risk assessment, gap analysis, controls testing, controls implementation, and quality assurance/validation. Further, in the year 2017, SBP granted an exemption for submission of Long Form Report (LFR) through external auditors. Moreover, as per SBP’s BSD Circular No. 01 dated July 06, 2021, banks were allowed to discontinue the annual submission of LFR or Annual Assessment Report (AAR) on the efficacy of ICFR to SBP. However, banks shall continue the preparation of AAR on the efficacy of ICFR under ICFR instructions/framework, and the Internal Audit Function will review and submit it to the Audit Committee for BoD approval, for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Additionally, the Bank has undertaken various initiatives to further strengthen internal controls, including but not limited to the implementation of continuous training and development programs for staff, and regular internal control reviews. The Management is confident that through the adoption of these measures, the Bank’s internal control environment is maintained at a satisfactory level.

The Bank's Management has established a dedicated Internal Control Department (ICD) under the Compliance Function, tasked with executing both on-site and off-site evaluations of processes associated with Support Functions and branch operations. The ICD is integral to the ongoing monitoring and identification of operational deficiencies, ensuring that immediate corrective measures are implemented. This department is responsible for enforcing adherence to policies and procedures that have received formal approval from the Board of Directors (BoD) and Senior Management, thus ensuring compliance.

The BoD endorses the above-stated management evaluation of internal controls and the ICFR program.

# Share Price Sensitivity Analysis

Below is a list of some key factors that can influence the share price of Faysal Bank Limited. The list is not exhaustive and intends to cover the major areas:

---

## Chunk 324

# Regulatory / Policy Changes

Any regulatory or policy changes that directly impact the overall banking landscape along with cost and / or revenue drivers are likely to exert a significant influence on the Bank’s stock price. For example, any change in monetary policy rate has a direct impact on yields of government securities, spreads made on advances and funding costs; and in turn materially impact profitability and the share price as well. Similarly, any hike in the minimum rate of return on deposits will result in compression in net interest margins earned and can negatively impact the earning and correspondingly the share price of the scrip.

# Investor and Market Sentiment

Such a sentiment driven impact on the share price can occur even in the absence of any fundamental development or change in the Bank’s business case.

## Chunk 326

# Methods and assumptions used in compiling the indicators

The Bank utilizes a comprehensive set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the success of both strategic initiatives and routine operational activities. These KPIs are carefully selected to align with the FBL's objectives, offering a clear and accurate picture of its financial health, operational efficiency, and competitive positioning. The FBL monitors a variety of traditional financial ratios, such as growth in deposits and advances, the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio, and the provision coverage ratio, which help assess asset quality and risk management. In addition, profitability ratios like the net margin, non-markup income to total income, cost-to-income ratio, return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and earnings per share (EPS) are closely tracked to gauge the FBL’s ability to generate income, manage costs, and provide returns to shareholders. Beyond these financial metrics, the FBL also analyzes its market position, comparing its performance to that of competitors and considering broader market conditions, such as regulatory changes and economic trends. This holistic approach enables the FBL to make informed, data-driven decisions that support sustainable growth and maintain a competitive edge in the market.

# Sensitivity Analysis due to Foreign Currency Fluctuations

Foreign exchange risk / currency risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in currency exchange rates. It refers to the impact of adverse movements in currency exchange rates on the value of open foreign currency positions. Changes in currency rates affect the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and may affect revenues from foreign exchange dealing.

The Bank undertakes currency risk mostly to support its trade services and maintains overall foreign exchange risk position to the extent of statutory Foreign Exchange Exposure Limit (FEEL) prescribed by the SBP. Exposure limits such as counterparty, gap, net open position, dealer and bucket-wise currency delta limits are in place in accordance with the Bank’s approved policies in order to manage associated risk and concentration at the acceptable tolerance levels.

For details about the Bank’s foreign exchange risk refer note 46.2.2 to the accompanying unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.

# Economic Update

The global economic landscape in 2024 presented a mixed outlook. While growth persisted, it did so at a slower pace. The US economy demonstrated resilience, with solid consumer spending and a healthy job market. However, inflation remained a persistent challenge, with core inflation proving sticky. In Europe, economic growth showed signs of slowing, while concerns over China’s economic recovery intensified.

On the domestic front, agricultural credit disbursement saw substantial growth during the first five months of the current fiscal year. This positive trajectory aligns with the ambitious targets set for the fiscal year. Additionally, increase in agricultural machinery imports underscores a clear focus on modernizing farming practices and improving sector efficiency. Meanwhile, the Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) sector recorded a marginal decline of 0.64% during Jul-Oct FY2025, a marked improvement compared to the 2.21% contraction in the same period last year.

Inflation trends offered some relief during the second half of 2024. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) averaged 7.3%, a significant reduction from 18.97% in the first half of the year. This improvement was driven by stable food prices, effective fiscal consolidation leading to a fiscal surplus, a current account surplus supported by higher exports and remittances, and an accommodative monetary policy. SBP expects the average inflation to remain between the range of 5.5% to 5.7% in FY 25.

The government’s fiscal performance in Q1 FY2025 surpassed expectations, particularly the targets agreed upon with the IMF. The primary budget surplus reached Rs 3,202 billion, significantly exceeding the target of Rs 198 billion. Even excluding a one-time transfer of Rs 2,500 billion from the State Bank of Pakistan, the primary surplus stood at Rs 702 billion, reflecting strong fiscal discipline.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in its latest announcement reduced the policy rate by 100 bps to 12% in line with market expectations. This was in the backdrop of a continued downward trend in inflation driven by moderate domestic demand conditions, supportive supply-side dynamics and a favorable base effect. The MPC assessed that the impact of the significant reduction by 1,000 bps in the policy rate since June 2024 will continue to unfold and further support economic activity. Risks to the future path of interest rates include missing tax revenues target of the H1-FY25 despite a substantial increase in December tax collection, heightened volatility in global oil prices over the past few weeks and lastly the global economic policy environment has become more uncertain, prompting central banks to adopt a cautious approach.

Considering these developments and evolving risks, the Committee viewed that a cautious monetary policy stance is needed to ensure price stability, which is essential for sustainable economic growth. In this regard, the MPC assessed that the real

## Chunk 362

# Economic Overview

Policy rate needs to remain adequately positive on a forward-looking basis to stabilize inflation in the target range of 5% to 7%.

The stock market has once again shown exceptional performance throughout 2024. The KSE100 Index gained 84% and was recognized as the world’s best-performing stock market in 2024 by Bloomberg.

The Current Account also posted a surplus of USD 912 million in CY2024 compared to a deficit of USD 825 million in the previous year, reflecting a significant improvement in trade balance. Exports increased by 10.63%, reaching USD 40.1 billion compared to USD 36.3 billion in the previous year. Imports grew by 14.9% to USD 66.6 billion from USD 57.9 billion. Consequently, the trade deficit widened to USD 26.4 billion from USD 21.6 billion last year. The PKR remained relatively stable, hovering around the 280 mark throughout the year.

# Bank’s Performance

The bank’s success story continued in 2024, being the second year of operations as a full-fledged Islamic bank. The focus remained on expanding branch network to increase customer reach, leverage technology to provide digital solutions to customers, controlling cost to improve return to the shareholders, improving customer service experience and proactively managing risks in challenging economic environments.

In 2023, the Board approved the establishment of Faysal Islami Currency Exchange Company (Private) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of FBL. The bank injected initial paid-up capital of PKR 1 billion during the year. The company received its “Certificate of Incorporation” from SECP on January 16, 2024, and obtained an operational license from SBP on March 26, 2024.

# Financial Excellence in 2024: A Testament to Resilience

With unwavering commitment to excellence, the Bank has sustained excellent financial performance and achieved unprecedented growth. Despite numerous challenges, the Bank has consistently proven its resilience and strength, celebrating the milestone of reaching the highest-ever profit. On a standalone basis, FBL has achieved a record-breaking Profit Before Tax (PBT) of PKR 50.4 billion, 21.7% higher than PKR 41.4 billion in the last year. The increase in Profit After Tax (PAT) was, however, restricted to 14.9% at PKR 23.0 billion due to the imposition of an additional income tax of 5%, which raised the tax rate from 49% to 54%. Earnings Per Share increased from PKR 13.21 to PKR 15.17.

During the year 2024, the Bank continued its growth trajectory and increased total revenue by 17.5% over 2023. This growth was fueled by balance sheet expansion, despite a steep decline in policy rate, resulting in a 13.1% YoY increase in net spread earned, taking it to PKR 80.4 billion. This growth was further supported by a PKR 81.7 billion (25.0%) increase in current deposits, strengthening the bank’s funding base.

Dividend income also increased by 23.6%, to PKR 0.4 billion, while a positive swing of PKR 3.0 billion YoY in capital gains was achieved, benefiting from the positive trajectory of the PSX.

The bank’s total expenses increased by 22.0% over 2023, driven by inflation and an expanding branch network. While non-fund income grew significantly by 43.5%, the growth in net spreads was limited to 13.1% due to a sharp decline in the policy rate. This, in turn, impacted on the cost-to-income ratio, which increased from 49.1% in 2023 to 51.0% in 2024. There is a net reversal of PKR 2.5 billion in provisions compared to a charge of PKR 0.9 billion last year. The NPL ratio continued to reduce and is at 3.6% as compared to 3.8% last year due to an increase in financing. The total coverage stands at 101.2%.

The bank’s total assets grew to PKR 1.6 trillion, driven by strong deposit mobilization and increase in financing from Financial Institutions. The positive trend in Current Accounts continued, growing to PKR 408 billion i.e., 25.0% growth over December 2023. Growth in total deposits was restricted to 2.6% over December 2023 due to ADR related tax implications. The Current Account (CA) share strengthened to 39.1% from 32.1% in December 2023 while the CASA mix improved to 85.5% from 75.0% in December 2023.

In line with the best practices of the corporate governance, FBL’s Board, since 2012 has conducted self-evaluation exercise on an annual basis by engaging Pakistan Institute of Corporate Governance (PICG), as an external facilitator. PICG is the lead on Corporate Governance and has a team of consultants to conduct board evaluations for companies and banks. SBP’s Guidelines on Performance Evaluation of Board of Directors were implemented in August 2016 and subsequently, FBL’s Board in compliance thereof conducts its self-evaluation every year by engaging PICG. The evaluation covers various aspects of the performance of the Board including but not limited to: Board’s role, Committees’ performance, Training, Strategy, Risk Management, and Board Meetings.

- The Board as a whole
- Individual Directors (Independent, Non-Executive and CEO)
- Board Committees

The evaluation was carried out using quantitative method, based on subjective assessment, and was conducted via questionnaires developed by the consultants in conformance with the State Bank of Pakistan’s Guidelines on Performance Evaluation of Board of Directors. The quantitative technique has the advantage of being specific and measurable. Measurement scale used in FBL’s Board evaluation is the summated rating on a scale of 1-10 depending on how strongly they agree or disagree with a given statement. The use of this method ensures specific and measurable data that can be benchmarked over time.

# Remuneration Policy

Disclosures relating to Remuneration Policy as required under BPRD Circular 1 of 2017 dated January 25, 2017, are included separately in this Annual Report.

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Pakistan. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants as adopted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (the Code) and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# Following is the Key Audit Matter:

## Chunk 413

# Key Audit Matter

As at 31 December 2024, the Bank’s Credit loss allowance against Islamic financing and related assets and off-balance sheet items amounted to Rs. 24,628 million and Rs. 187 million, respectively.

As per the BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023, the Bank adopted requirements of IFRS 9 along with the Application Instructions issued by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) (hereafter referred as “application instruction of IFRS 9”) from 1 January 2024 which requires the Bank to recognize Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on Islamic financing and related assets and off-balance sheet items. The estimation of ECL involves judgement and complexity.

The key areas which are subject to complexity and judgement in the estimation of ECL are:

- Model estimations – judgmental modelling and assumption are used to estimate ECL which involves determining Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD). Respective models assumptions are key driver of uncertainty, and are required in the application of these model for calculation of the ECL estimate.
- Economic scenarios – IFRS 9 requires the Bank to measure ECL on an unbiased forward-looking basis reflecting a range of future economic conditions. Complex Statistical methodology is applied in determining the forward-looking economic scenarios used as an input to calculate ECL, the associated scenario probability weightings, and the key economic variables that drive the scenarios.
- Qualitative criteria – the criteria selected to identify a SICR involves judgment and can lead to unreliable ECL recognized for certain portfolios.

In line with the application instructions of IFRS 9, the Bank must compare the ECL for Stage 3 with the provision determined under the Prudential Regulations (PR) issued by the SBP. The PR requires specific provisioning against the Islamic financing and related assets on the basis of time-based criteria.

## Chunk 414

# How the matter was addressed in our audit

Our audit procedures, amongst others, included the following:

- Performing risk assessment procedures over the credit loss allowance against Islamic financing and related assets and off-balance sheet exposure within the Bank’s unconsolidated financial statement. As part of these risk assessment procedures, identifying the elements associated with risk of material misstatement on application including those arising from judgements over the estimation of ECL either due to, methods/models, assumptions or data.
- Assessing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls established by the Bank over measurement of ECL and provision calculated as per PR.
- We involved in-house specialist who assisted in the following:
- Evaluating the Bank’s ECL model methodologies for compliance with application instructions of IFRS 9
- Assessing the reasonableness of the Bank’s methodology for determining the economic scenarios used and the probability weightings applied to them by independently validating and challenging the assumption, methodologies, and outputs of the models;
- Assessing the reasonableness of macro-economic variable and economic forecasts by comparing these to external sourced data extracted; and
- Performing independent testing of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) allowance on a sample basis.
- Assessing the appropriateness of SICR criteria applied by the Bank by ensuring that the SICR criteria and staging methodology are consistent with the application instructions of IFRS 9.

# Information Other than the Unconsolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Reports Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Bank’s Annual Report but does not include the consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements and our auditor’s reports thereon.

Our opinion on the unconsolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the unconsolidated financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Chunk 417

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the unconsolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.

## Chunk 418

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the unconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

232 Faysal Bank
---
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## Chunk 419

# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

1. Based on our audit, we further report that in our opinion:
1. proper books of account have been kept by the Bank as required by the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and the returns referred above from the branches have been found adequate for the purpose of our audit;
2. the unconsolidated statement of financial position, the unconsolidated profit and loss account, the unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated statement of changes in equity and unconsolidated cash flow statement together with the notes thereon have been drawn up in conformity with the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and are in agreement with the books of account and returns;
3. investments made, expenditure incurred and guarantees extended during the year were in accordance with the objects and powers of the Bank and the transactions of the Bank which have come to our notice have been within the powers of the Bank; and
4. zakat deductible at source under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance, 1980 (XVIII of 1980), was deducted by the Bank and deposited in the Central Zakat Fund established under section 7 of that Ordinance.
2. We confirm that for the purpose of our audit we have covered more than sixty per cent of the total Islamic financing and related assets of the Bank.

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IFRS or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has adopted requirements of IFRS 9 along with the application instructions through BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023, dated April 13, 2023, but deferred certain requirements. The requirement to carry unquoted securities at fair value has been deferred until January 1, 2025. Furthermore, Islamic banking institutions have been allowed to follow Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) 1 & 2 where applicable and continue existing accounting practices for other Islamic products until further instructions. The impact of profit of financing in advance stage is Rs. 1,504 million excluding any Effective yield rate (EIR) effect as the Bank has received deferment of recording income and expense at EIR via letter from SBP till 31 December 2025. Consequently, these deferred requirements of IFRS 9 have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements. Furthermore, Banks are required to apply modification accounting retrospectively however it will be applied only on the financing modified on or after 1st January 2020 as allowed by SBP.

## Chunk 431

# 3.2

The SBP allowed the Bank to adjust the amortisation of intangible assets against the portion of reserve which arose on account of such assets identified as a result of such acquisition. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Bank has adjusted an amortisation of intangible assets net of tax amounting to Rs. 52.650 million (2023: Rs. 68.968 million) from the NCR.

---

## Chunk 432

# 3.3

The SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 04 dated February 25, 2015 has clarified that the reporting requirements of IFAS-3, 'Profit and loss sharing on deposits' for Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services (IIFS) relating to annual, half yearly and quarterly financial statements would be notified by the SBP through issuance of specific instructions and uniform disclosure formats in consultation with IIFS. These reporting requirements have not been notified to date. Accordingly, the disclosure requirements under IFAS 3 have not been considered in these unconsolidated financial statements.

---

## Chunk 433

# 3.4

The SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment property' for Banking Companies through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002 till further instructions. Further, the SECP has also deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, 'Financial instruments: disclosures' through its S.R.O. 633(I)/2014 dated July 10, 2014. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements.

---

## Chunk 434

# 3.5

The SECP through S.R.O. 56(1)/2016 dated January 28, 2016, has directed that the requirements of IFRS 10, 'Consolidated financial statements' are not applicable in case of investments by companies in mutual funds established under Trust Deed structure.

## Chunk 439

# 3.7.4

Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of unconsolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires the use of certain accounting estimates. It also requires the management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Bank's accounting policies. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The areas where various assumptions and estimates are significant to the Bank's financial statements or where judgement was exercised in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

- i) Business combinations (note 6.1);
- ii) Classification of investments (note 6.4.2 and 9);
- iii) Valuation of financial assets and liabilities as per IFRS 9, associates and joint ventures (note 6.4.2 and 6.6);
- iv) Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance (notes 6.4.10);
- v) Valuation and depreciation of property and equipment (note 6.9 and 11.2);

## Chunk 441

# 4 BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims which have been carried at revalued amounts, certain investments and derivative contracts which have been marked to market and are carried at fair value, obligations in respect of staff retirement benefits and lease liabilities which have been carried at present value and right-of-use assets which are initially measured at an amount equal to the corresponding lease liabilities (adjusted for any lease payments and costs as disclosed in details in note 6.26 to these unconsolidated financial statements) and depreciated over the respective lease terms.

---

## Chunk 442

# 5 FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY

# 5.1

Items included in these unconsolidated financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Bank operates. These unconsolidated financial statements are presented in Pakistani Rupees, which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency.

# 5.2

Figures have been rounded off to the nearest thousand of rupees unless otherwise stated.

# 6 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as disclosed in note 6.4 and 6.5.

---

## Chunk 443

# 6.1 Business Combination

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. The cost of acquisition is measured as the fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued and the liabilities incurred or assumed as at the date of acquisition. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, if any. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values as at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the Bank's share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the unconsolidated profit and loss account. However, as more fully described in note 13.3 to these unconsolidated financial statements, the gain on bargain purchase arising on an acquisition made in 2010 has been recognised directly in equity as per the directives of the SBP.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is measured, subsequent to initial recognition, at its cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication of impairment as per the requirements of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 36, 'Impairment of assets'. Impairment charge in respect of goodwill is recognised in the unconsolidated profit and loss account and is not subsequently reversed.

Acquisition of non-controlling interests (NCI) is measured at the proportionate share of the NCI in the fair value of the net assets acquired by the Bank. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the proportionate share of the NCI in the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognised in equity. (Referring to the 'Reserve arising on amalgamation').

The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘expected credit losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the IFRS 9 Application Instructions from January 1, 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at January 1, 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard.

Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9.

Certain equity securities are held by the Bank in separate portfolios and are managed with an objective of realising cash flows through sale. The Bank primarily focuses on fair value information and uses that information to assess the securities’ performance and to make decisions. Moreover, certain asset-backed securities have contractual cash flows that are not SPPI. These assets are therefore measured at FVPL under IFRS 9. (AFS to FVPL).

Certain debt securities are held by the Bank in separate portfolios to meet everyday liquidity needs. The Bank seeks to minimise the costs of managing these liquidity needs and therefore actively manages the return on the portfolio. That return consists of collecting contractual payments as well as gains and losses from the sale of financial assets. The investment strategy often results in sales activity that is significant in value. The Bank considers that under IFRS 9 these securities are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. Moreover, certain equity investments held by the Bank for strategic purposes have been designated under IFRS 9 as at FVOCI. (AFS to FVOCI).

Corporate debt securities that were previously classified as held-to-maturity are now classified at amortised cost. The Bank intends to hold the assets to maturity to collect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist solely of payments of principal and profit on the principal amount outstanding. (HTM to AC).

Islamic financing and related assets except for Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), staff financing and modified financing are stated at cost. Whereas, Temporary economic refinance scheme, staff financing and modified financing are stated at amortized cost.

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

# 6.4.1 Impact on regulatory capital

In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the “transitional adjustment amount”) must be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the “transition period” of five years.

Had IFRS 9 not been applied then on estimated basis CAR would have been lower by 23 bps from 16.54% to 16.31%. The Bank has applied the transitional arrangement on Regulatory Capital. Had the transitional arrangement not been applied then CAR would have been higher by 23 bps from 16.54% to 16.77%. The Bank has applied the transitional arrangement on Regulatory Capital. Had the transitional arrangement not been applied than Leverage Ratio would have been lower by 7 bps from 4.70% to 4.63%.

---

## Chunk 455

# 6.4.2 Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Profit (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) regardless of the business model in which they are held.

---

## Chunk 456

# Recognition and initial measurement

Debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at transaction price. The fair value of a financial asset on initial recognition is generally its transaction price. If the Bank determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognized in profit and loss account on an appropriate basis over the life of the asset but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data, or the transaction is closed out. Islamic financing and related assets other than staff financing and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) are initially measured at transaction price i.e., the amount of financing disbursed at disbursement date.

---

## Chunk 457

# Classification of Financial Assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as either amortized cost, FVOCI, or FVPL whereas Islamic financing and related assets except for staff financing, the Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), and modified financing, are carried at cost.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets; and

Annual Report 2024 245

## Chunk 458

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

Islamic financing and related assets are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, except for Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), staff financing and modified financing, which are measured at amortized cost.

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Bank changes its business models for managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following changes in the business model.

IFRS 9 allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any 'accounting mismatch' that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different basis. SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout life of the instrument.

---

## Chunk 459

# Classification of Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit and loss account (FVPL), when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortized cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognized in profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortized cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective yield rate method. Profit expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 460

# 6.4.3 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either Held to collect, Held to collect and sale and Others based on Business model assessment. The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The assessment requires judgement based on facts and circumstances on the date of assessment. The assessment considers the policies and objectives for the portfolio of financial assets, risk affecting, performance evaluation, business manager’s compensation and historical sales information.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

---

## Chunk 461

# 6.4.4 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and profit (SPPI)

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Profit’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as profit margin.

The Bank assesses whether the contractual cash flows of a financial asset meet the Solely Payments of Principal and Profit (SPPI) criterion by examining the contractual terms. This includes checking for terms that could alter the amount and timings of cash flows, such as contingent events, leverage, or prepayment features, etc.

A prepayment feature aligns with SPPI if it mainly represents unpaid principal and profit, including reasonable compensation for early termination.

For fixed-rate financings with periodic profit rate resets, the Bank considers these SPPI-compliant as the revised rates reflect time value, credit risk, and other associated risks.

# 6.4.5 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

- Financial assets at FVPL: These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any profit or dividend income, are recognised in statement of profit or loss account.
- Financial assets at amortised cost: These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective yield method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Profit and impairment are recognised in statement of profit or loss account.
- Debt investments at FVOCI: These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and is assessed for impairment under the new ECL model. Profit income is calculated using the effective yield method and includes amortization of premiums and accretion of discount and impairment are recognised in profit and loss account. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to statement of profit or loss account.
- Equity investments at FVOCI: These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are adjusted from the carrying value of investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to statement of profit or loss account.
- Unquoted Securities: Unquoted equity securities are valued at the lower of cost and break-up value. The break-up value of these securities is calculated with reference to the net assets of the investee company as per the latest available audited financial statements. The Bank may also use unaudited or management accounts to determine if any additional deficit needs to be charged.
- Islamic financing and related assets at cost: Islamic financing and related assets are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, except for Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and staff financing, modified financing which are carried at amortized cost, net of expected credit loss allowances.

---

## Chunk 463

# 6.4.6 Amortised cost and gross carrying amount

The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective yield method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance (or impairment allowance before 1 January 2024).

The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

# 6.4.7 Calculation of profit income and expense

Income is recorded in accordance with IFAS 1 and IFAS 2. Furthermore, for other Islamic products income is recorded based on the contractual rate in accordance with the Shari'ah principles.

Annual Report 2024  247

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

Profit expense on domestic financial liabilities (comprising deposits and borrowings) is recognized on an accrual basis in the period in which it is incurred, based on their contractual rates.

---

## Chunk 464

# 6.4.8 Derecognition

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognized), and the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in OCI is recognized in the profit and loss account, except that in case of the derecognition of equity securities held at FVOCI, cumulative gains or losses are transferred to unappropriated profit.

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

---

## Chunk 465

# 6.4.9 Modification

# Financial assets

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognized and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs.

If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms.

If the bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

Where derecognition of financial assets is appropriate, the newly recognised residual financing are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classified as purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI).

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the bank first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective yield rate of the asset and recognised the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit and loss account.

If such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as profit income calculated using the effective yield rate method.

---

## Chunk 466

# Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability recognised and consideration paid is recognised in profit and loss account.

248 Faysal Bank

---

## Chunk 467

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective yield rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit and loss account. For floating-rate financial liabilities, the original effective yield rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective yield rate on the instrument.

---

## Chunk 468

# 6.4.10 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain financing commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (‘12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’).

---

## Chunk 469

# Restructured financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognized and ECL are measured as follows:

- If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset.
- If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective yield rate of the existing financial asset.

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in ‘Stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘Stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘Stage 3’.

---

## Chunk 470

# Non-Performing financial assets

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘non-performing’, when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred, this includes time based criteria and subjective evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower.

A financing that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail financing that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.

Under the IFRS 9 Application instructions, the Bank is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. The Bank is required to calculate ECL on its non-performing financial assets as higher of provision under Prudential Regulations (PR) and ECL under IFRS 9.

The Bank calculates the ECL against corporate, commercial & SME financing portfolios as higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at borrower/facility level, whereas against the retail borrowers the Bank calculates the ECL at higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at segment/product basis as instructed by SBP under Annexure-A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024.

ECL is the probability weighted estimate of expected cash shortfalls which is determined by multiplying the probability of default (PD) with the loss given default (LGD) with the expected exposure at the time of default (EAD).
---

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

Requirements of IFRS 9 and Application Instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

---

## Chunk 471

# Probability of default:

The Probability of Default represents the likelihood that a counterparty will default within a specific timeframe, such as 12 months (12-month ECL for Stage 1) or the lifetime of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL for Stage 2). The Bank calculates PD on Islamic financing and related assets which is further bifurcated into retail and non retail portfolios. Following is the methodology through which non retail and retail PD are calculated:

# Non-Retail PD:

The Bank utilizes its internal risk rating system to assign Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) to borrowers. Bank has used a statistical method, for the estimation of Through The Cycle (TTC) PDs associated with each of its Obligor Risk Rating (ORR).

---

## Chunk 472

# Retail PD:

Bank has used the roll-rate method for retail portfolios based on its different risk characteristics and historical default trends. Bank has used historical data to estimate TTC PD for its retail segments.

Moreover, the Bank calculates Expected Credit Loss (ECL) on investments and balances with other banks by utilizing Probability of Default (PD) data, which tracks corporate credit rating transitions over time. This historical data helps to assess the likelihood of changes in creditworthiness and defaults.

---

## Chunk 473

# Incorporation of forward-looking information:

Forward looking information is incorporated to convert TTC PD to Point in Time Probability of Default (PiT) PD. The Bank has estimated the PiT PDs in its PD Model. For this purpose, the Bank incorporated 5-year forecasts obtained from the Macro Economic Variable (MEV) database of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

---

## Chunk 474

# Exposure at Default (EAD):

The Bank has defined EAD for financial assets carried at an amortized cost equal to principal plus accrued profit at the default date. Each repayment date is assumed to be a default point in the model, and the ECL is calculated on the EAD at each repayment date and discounted at the effective yield rate to arrive at the discounted ECL under three scenarios, i.e., base, worst, and best-case scenarios. The unutilized exposures are multiplied with Credit Conversion Factors (CCFs) to compute the EAD of revolving facilities. For non revolving facilities, CCF is only applied to unutilized exposures when the Bank doesn’t have unconditional right to revoke the undrawn portion. Additionally, cash and cash equivalent collateral the Bank holds against non-retail facilities are adjusted from the EAD, and ECL is calculated on the net amount. The Bank has developed CCF models for its revolving and non revolving facilities based on the historical utilization of credit limits which are currently being applied to the revolving portfolio.

---

## Chunk 475

# Loss Given Default:

Loss Given Default (LGD) represents the forecasted economic loss in the event of default, calculated independently of credit quality and applied consistently across all stages. LGD is determined as the percentage of loss expected in case of borrower default, incorporating historical data, cash recovery experience (including settlements), costs and time of recoveries, collateral realizations, and recovery projections. For non-collateralized portfolios, the Bank estimates LGD based on actual recoveries from defaulted accounts over a historical period of 3-5 years prior to the assessment date. Forward-looking information is incorporated into the LGD calculation to reflect the impact of macroeconomic factors on the expected recoveries.

# Purchase or Originated Credit Impaired Financial Assets

Purchase or Originated Credit Impaired (POCI) financial assets are assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition. Expected credit loss for these assets is not recognized in a separate loss provision on initial recognition, as the lifetime expected credit loss is inherent within the gross carrying amount of the instruments. Consequently, POCI assets do not

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

carry an impairment allowance on initial recognition. The amount recognized as a loss allowance after initial recognition is equal to the changes in lifetime ECL since the initial recognition of the asset.

---

## Chunk 477

# Presentation of allowance for Expected Credit Loss in the Statement of Financial Position

Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the statement of financial position as follows:

- Financial assets measured at amortized cost / cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets.
- financing commitments and financial guarantee contracts: as a provision in Other Assets / Liabilities.
- where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Bank does not identify the ECL on the financing commitment component separately from those on the drawn component and instead presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision.

## Chunk 478

# 6.4.11 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations. A financial asset is transitioned to a backward stage in line with SBP instructions.

---

## Chunk 479

# 6.4.12 Write-offs

Financial assets are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level.

Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in the statement of profit and loss account.

Financial assets that are written off / charge off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Bank’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

---

## Chunk 480

# 6.4.13 Off-setting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are set off and the net amount is reported in the unconsolidated financial statements only when the Bank has a legally enforceable right to set off and the Bank intends to either settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and to settle the liabilities simultaneously. Income and expense items of such assets and liabilities are also offset and the net amount is reported in the unconsolidated financial statements only when permitted by the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan.

## Chunk 481

# 6.4.14 Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank has adopted a governance framework requiring multiple functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. The Risk Department defines the staging criteria for the new impairment model and take ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach.

Additionally, the Risk department also take the ownership of the impact of ECL on bank's capital. The Bank’s Finance Division performs ECL calculation. As a result, the department then assess the financial impact, meet the financial reporting requirements and further monitor the impact on the financial ratios.

# 6.4.15 Undrawn financing commitments and guarantees

Financial guarantees are contracts that require the Bank to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financing commitments are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions. When estimating lifetime ECL for undrawn financing commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financing commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the financing are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

---

## Chunk 483

# 6.4.16 Acceptances

Acceptances arise when the Bank is under an obligation to make payments against documents drawn under letters of credit. Acceptances specify the amount of money, the date, and the person to which the payment is due. After acceptance, the instrument becomes an unconditional liability (time draft) of the Bank and is therefore recognized as a financial liability in the statement of financial position with a corresponding contractual right of reimbursement from the customer recognized as a financial asset. Acceptances have been considered within the scope of IFRS 9 ‐ Financial Instruments for the purpose of calculation of expected credit loss and are valued at amortized cost and continued to be recognized as a financial liability in the statement of financial position with a contractual right of reimbursement from the customer as a financial asset.

## Chunk 484

# 6.4.17 Wa’ad / Promissory Contracts

Wa’ad / promissory contracts are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to fair value using appropriate valuation techniques. All Wa’ad / promissory contracts are carried as assets when fair value is positive and liability when fair value is negative. Any change in the fair value of Wa’ad / promissory contracts is taken to the profit and loss account.

# 6.5 Revised format of annual financial statements

SBP through its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 9, 2023, has amended the format of annual financial statements of banks. All banks are required to prepare their annual financial statements on the revised format effective from accounting year starting from January 1, 2024. Accordingly, the Bank has prepared these annual financial statements on the new format prescribed by the SBP. The adoption of the new format contains additional disclosures and certain changes in the financial statements’ presentation, primarily due to the implementation of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan. However, the corresponding figures continue to be classified and disclosed in accordance with the previous financial accounting and reporting framework. Adoption of revised financial statements format has also resulted in following material changes (due to which the corresponding presentations have also been changed):

- Right-of-use-assets (note 12) amounting to Rs 13,289.601 million (December 31, 2023: Rs 10,713.046 million) which were previously shown as part of fixed assets are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.
- Lease liabilities (note 18) amounting to Rs 15,546.893 million (December 31, 2023: Rs 12,868.103 million) which were previously shown as part of other liabilities (note 20) are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.

# 6.6 Investment in associates and subsidiaries

## Chunk 486

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

entrusted with fiduciary duties towards the unit holders of the funds. This fiduciary obligation requires AMC to act in the best interests of its unit holders, refraining from exploiting opportunities for its own benefit or that of its related parties, group companies, or employees, to the detriment of the unit holders.

The Bank has significant influence over such mutual funds due to participation in the investee's policy-making processes via FAML and investment in such mutual funds is considered as investment in associates. These are not considered subsidiary due to the legal trust structure of the entity, the Bank does not have the ability to affect returns through its power over the investee. Further, under this trust structure, the trusteeship is separate from the management, and the independent trustees play a key role in overseeing the activities of the AMC. The Bank has significant influence over mutual funds where it has holding percentage of less than 20% due to power to participate in the investee's policy-making processes via the FAML and investment in such mutual funds is considered as investment in associates. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Bank has control.

# Subsequent measurement of Associates and subsidiaries

Investment in associates and subsidiaries are recorded at cost less accumulated impairment, if any.

## Chunk 487

# Impairment of Investment in associate

In respect of investment in associates, the Bank reviews their carrying values at each reporting date to assess whether there is an indication of impairment. The amount of impairment loss would be determined based on the higher of values in use and fair value less cost to sell. Impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.

## Chunk 488

# 6.7 Investments (Applicable before January 1, 2024)

# 6.7.1 Classification

The Bank classifies its investments as follows:

(a) Held for trading

These are securities, which are either acquired for the purpose of generating profit from short-term fluctuations in market prices, yield rate movements, or dealer’s margin or are securities included in the portfolio in which a pattern of short-term profit making exists.

(b) Held to maturity

These are securities with fixed or determinable payments and maturity that the Bank has a positive intent and ability to hold to maturity.

(c) Available for sale

These are investments, other than those, in associates and subsidiaries, that do not fall under either held for trading or held to maturity categories.

---

## Chunk 489

# 6.7.2 Initial recognition and measurement

All purchases and sales of investments that require delivery within the time frame established by the regulations or market convention are recognised at the trade date. Trade date is the date on which the Bank commits to purchase or sell the investment.

Investments other than those classified as held for trading are initially recognised at fair value which includes transaction costs associated with the investments. Investments classified as 'held for trading' are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs associated with the transactions are expensed through the profit and loss account.

Premium or discount on acquisition of investments is amortised through the profit and loss account over the remaining period till maturity using the effective yield method.

# 6.7.3 Subsequent measurement

# Held for trading

These are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Any unrealised surplus / deficit arising on revaluation is taken into profit and loss account.

# Held to maturity

These are measured at amortised cost using the effective yield method, less any impairment recognised to reflect irrecoverable amounts.

---

## Chunk 491

# Available for sale

Quoted securities classified as available for sale investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Any surplus or deficit arising thereon is kept in a separate account shown in the statement of financial position within equity and is taken to the profit and loss account when realised upon disposal or when the investments are considered to be impaired.

Unquoted equity securities are valued at the lower of cost and break-up value. The break-up value of these securities is calculated with reference to the net assets of the investee company as per the latest available audited financial statements. The Bank may also use unaudited or management accounts to determine if any additional impairment needs to be charged beyond amounts already changed based on audited financial statements. Investments in other unquoted securities are valued at cost less impairment, if any.

---

## Chunk 492

# 6.7.4 Impairment

# Available for sale and held to maturity investments

Impairment loss in respect of investments classified as available for sale and held to maturity is recognised based on management's assessment of objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that may have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the investments. A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a listed equity investment below its cost is also considered an objective evidence of impairment. The determination of significant or prolonged decline requires judgement.

Provision in the value of term finance certificates and sukuk certificates is made as per the requirements of the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP. In case of impairment of available for sale securities, the cumulative loss that has been recognised in surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities on the statement of financial position within equity is removed therefrom and recognised in the profit and loss account.

# 6.8 Islamic financing and related assets

# 6.8.1 Financing is stated net of credit loss allowance and fair value adjustment.

The amount of credit loss allowance is charged to the profit and loss account. Financing is written off / charge off in accordance with Bank policy by extinguishing them against the provision held. These write-offs / charge off do not, in any way, prejudice the Bank's right of recovery from these customers. The Bank offers various Islamic financing products the details of which are as follows:

# (a) Murabaha

# (j) Government grants (Applicable after January 1, 2024)

Government grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance of receipt and compliance with attached conditions. Asset-related grants are either recorded as deferred income or deducted from the asset’s carrying amount, while income grants are systematically recognized in profit or loss. In line with IAS 20, government financing at below-market rates are treated as grants, with the benefit measured as the difference between the financing fair value and the proceeds received. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has introduced temporary refinancing schemes to provide economic relief, which qualify as government grants. These are accounted for by bifurcating the liability into a financial liability under IFRS 9, measured at fair value, and a deferred grant liability representing the benefit received. The deferred grant liability is recognized in statement of financial position, at inception is initially offset against the fair value loss on below market rate financing provided to customers. The remaining portion is subsequently amortized over the tenure of financing, aligning with the unwinding difference between SBP refinance and customer financing.

# 6.9 Property and equipment and depreciation

# (a) Tangible assets

Property and equipment other than land and buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Buildings are carried at revalued amount less any accumulated depreciation and subsequent impairment losses, if any. Land is carried at revalued amount less any subsequent impairment losses, if any.

Depreciation on property and equipment (excluding land which is not depreciated) is charged using the straight line method in accordance with the rates specified in note 11.2 to these financial statements after taking into account residual value, if significant. The asset's residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if required, at each reporting date. Depreciation on additions is charged once the assets become available for use and it stops when the asset is disposed or it is fully depreciated.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amounts or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repair and maintenance expenditures are charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account as and when incurred.

Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that the net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value.

An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

Gains / losses on disposal of property and equipment, if any, are taken to the profit and loss account in the period in which these arise except that the related surplus on revaluation of property and equipment (net of deferred taxation) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

Surplus on revaluation of property and equipment (net of associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit.

## Chunk 504

# (c) Intangible assets

Intangible assets having definite lives are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The intangible assets include directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the intangible asset. Amortisation, except for customer relationship, is charged by applying the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets. Amortisation is calculated so as to write-off the assets over their expected economic lives at rates specified in note 13 to these unconsolidated financial statements. Amortisation is charged from when the asset is available for use and stops when the asset is disposed or its fully amortised. The intangible asset comprising customer relationship is being amortised over the life expectancy of the deposits. The residual values and useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amounts or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Gains and losses on disposals, if any, are taken to the profit and loss account in the period in which these arise.

---

## Chunk 505

# 6.10 Impairment

The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at each reporting date for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, and where the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount, assets are written down to their recoverable amount, except in the case of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or an intangible asset not yet available for use and goodwill acquired in a business combination for which impairment is tested annually irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment. The resulting impairment loss is taken to the profit and loss account except for impairment loss on revalued assets, which is adjusted against related revaluation surplus to the extent that the impairment loss does not exceed the surplus on revaluation of asset. An impairment loss is reversed except for impairment loss relating to goodwill, if there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the recoverable amount. Such reversals are only made to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognised.

# 6.11 Taxation

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

# Current

Provision for current taxation is based on taxable income for the year. Tax charge for the current year is determined in accordance with the prevailing laws for taxation. The charge for the current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

# Prior

The charge / reversals for prior years represent adjustments to the tax charge / reversals for prior years, arising from assessments, changes in estimates, and retrospectively applied changes to the law, made during the current year.

# 6.11 Deferred

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities used for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for taxation purposes. In addition, the Bank also records deferred tax asset on available tax losses. Deferred tax is calculated using the rates that are expected to apply to the period when the differences reverse based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax asset is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realised.

The carrying amount of the deferred tax asset is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.

## Chunk 507

# 6.12 Assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, if any. These assets are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying values do not differ materially from their fair values. Legal fee, transfer costs and direct costs of acquiring title to the non-banking assets are charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account and these are not capitalised as part of non-banking assets. A surplus arising on revaluation of non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of assets' account. Any deficit arising on revaluation is first set off against the surplus account for that particular non-banking asset, if any, or if no surplus exists, is charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account. These assets are disclosed in other assets as specified by the SBP.

Surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets (net of associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit.

# 6.13 Provisions and contingent assets and liabilities

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.

Contingent assets are not recognised and are also not disclosed unless an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognised and are disclosed unless the probability of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.

# 6.15 Deposits and other accounts

Deposits are generated on the basis of two modes i.e. Qard and Mudaraba. Deposits taken on Qard basis are classified as 'Current accounts' (non-remunerative) and deposits generated on Mudaraba basis are classified as 'Savings deposits' and 'Term deposits'. No profit or loss is passed on to current account depositors, however the funds of current accounts are treated as equity of the Bank for the purpose of profit calculation. Usually no restriction on withdrawals or number of transactions in current and savings accounts. In case of term deposits, pre-mature withdrawals can be made as per approved terms only.

Profits realised in investment pools are distributed in pre-agreed profit-sharing ratio between Rab-ul-Maal and Mudarib. Rab-ul-Maal share is distributed among depositors according to weightages assigned at the inception of profit calculation period. Profits are distributed from the pool such that the depositors (remunerative) only bear the risk of assets in the pool during the profit calculation period. In case of loss in a pool during the profit calculation period, the loss is distributed among the depositors (remunerative) according to their ratio of Investments. Pools are created at the Bank's discretion and the Bank can add, remove or transfer an asset to any other pool in the interests of the deposit holders.

# Profit / (loss) distribution to depositor's pool

Parameters used for allocation of profit, charging expenses and provisions etc. along with a brief description of their major components:

Gross income generated from relevant assets, calculated at the end of the month is first divided between FBL Islamic and investors / depositors in the ratio of FBL Islamic equity commingled in a pool on pro rata basis, and then amongst FBL Islamic and the depositors as per agreed mudarib fee and weightages declared before start of a month, respectively.

All Mudarabah and Musharaka based deposits are fully invested in respective Pools to produce returns for them. In case where FBL Islamic is unable to utilise all funds available for investment, priority is given to the deposit account holders.

All remunerative accounts such as remunerative current accounts, saving accounts, investment certificates, etc. are opened on the basis of Mudarabah, Musharaka, Wakalah or a combination of Mudarabah and Musharaka.

## Chunk 526

# 6.26 Lease liability and right-of-use assets

At the inception of the contract, the Bank assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. The Bank applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Bank recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

At the commencement date of the lease, the Bank recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The Bank determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. After the commencement date, the Bank reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control that affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. The Bank cannot readily determine the profit rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental fund acceptance rate to measure lease liabilities.

# 6.27 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity and recognised at their face value. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

# 13.2.2

This represents an intangible asset (customer relationship) which comprises of core deposits which were recognised at the time of acquisition of ex-RBS Pakistan. These core deposits represent the funding benefit that would be available to the Bank on account of availability of funding through customers deposit rather than from the wholesale or interbank market. This benefit also considers the fact that the economic life time of these deposits is longer than their contractual life. Based on this assumption, this intangible asset had been valued using certain valuation techniques and is being amortised over the life expectancy of these deposits. As more fully explained in note 13.3 to these unconsolidated financial statements, the SBP allowed the Bank to adjust the amortisation charge arising on this intangible asset against non-distributable capital reserve. The remaining amortisation period of this intangible asset is ranging from 5 to 6 years.

# 13.3

Non-distributable capital reserve - gain on bargain purchase

As per the directive of the SBP through its letter BPRD (R&P-02)/625-99/2011/3744 dated March 28, 2011, gain arising on bargain purchase of Pakistan operations of Royal Bank of Scotland (ex-RBS Pakistan) was credited directly into equity as non-distributable capital reserve (NCR). The SBP allowed the Bank to adjust the amortisation of the intangible asset against the portion of reserve which arose on account of such asset. Accordingly, the Bank has adjusted amortisation of intangible asset amounting to Rs 52.650 million (2023: Rs. 68.968 million) (net of tax) from the non-distributable capital reserve.

# 23.3.1

Income tax assessments of the Bank have been finalised upto the tax year 2024 (accounting year ended December 31, 2023). The department and the Bank has disagreement on a matter relating to taxability of gain on bargain purchase on the acquisition of ex-RBS Pakistan. The additional tax liability on the matter amounts to Rs. 1,154.701 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 1,154.701 million). The Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [(CIR(A)] had deleted the said additional tax liability, however the income tax department had filed an appeal with the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) against the order of CIR(A). During the current year, the ATIR passed an order and maintained the decision of the CIR(A) in favour of the Bank that gain on bargain purchase is not taxable. Subsequently, the department has challenged the order in Honourable High Court of Sindh. However, the management of the Bank is confident that the matter will be decided in the Bank's favour and accordingly, no provision has been recorded in these unconsolidated financial statements in respect of this matter.

# 38 DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN

# 38.1 General description

The Bank operates an approved funded gratuity scheme for all its permanent employees and employees who are on contractual service in non-management cadre. The benefits under the gratuity schemes are payable on retirement at the age of 60 years or earlier cessation of service in lumpsum. The benefits are equal to one month's last drawn basic salary for each year of eligible service or part thereof. The minimum qualifying eligible service for gratuity is 1 year for employees who became members of the Funds before November 12, 2002. In the case of other members of the Funds the minimum qualifying eligible service is 5 years. The minimum qualifying eligible service for contractual employees not employed under the management cadre is 6 months. The latest actuarial valuation of the Bank's defined benefit plan, based on the Projected Unit Credit Actuarial Cost Method, was carried out as at December 31, 2024. The balance of conventional sub-funds has been transferred to islamic sub-fund.

# 38.11 Sensitivity analysis

The analysis based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the gratuity liability recognised within the statement of financial position. The increase / (decrease) in the present value of defined benefit obligations as a result of change in each assumption should be summarised as illustrated below:

| |2024|2023|
|---|---|---|
|1% increase in discount rate|(193,444)|(131,397)|
|1% decrease in discount rate|222,389|149,748|
|1% increase in expected rate of salary increase|224,308|152,716|
|1% decrease in expected rate of salary increase|(198,665)|(136,223)|

# Maturity profile

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 8.11 years.

# Funding policy

The policy followed by the Bank in respect of the staff retirement benefit schemes is disclosed in note 6.14 of these unconsolidated financial statements.

---

## Chunk 617

# The gratuity scheme exposes the Bank to the following risks:

# Asset volatility

The Defined Benefit Gratuity Islamic Fund is invested in Ijarah Sukuk. The investment is almost 94.91% (Rs. 2,331 million) for Ijarah Sukuk. Islamic Fund has not such investment in any Government Bonds and Corporate Bonds hence the asset volatility risk is lower.

---

## Chunk 618

# Changes in bond yields

There are two dimensions to the changes in Bond yields: first, as described above; second, the valuation of the gratuity Liability is discounted with reference to these bond yields. So any increase in Bond yields will lower the gratuity Liability and vice versa, but, it will also lower the asset values.

---

## Chunk 619

# Inflation risk

The salary inflation is the major risk that the gratuity fund liability carries. In a general economic sense and in a longer view, there is a case that if bond yields increase, the change in salary inflation generally offsets the gains from the decrease in discounted gratuity liability. But viewed with the fact that asset values will also decrease, the salary inflation does, as an overall affect, increases the net liability of the Bank.

---

## Chunk 620

# Life expectancy / withdrawal rate

The Gratuity is paid off at the maximum of age 60. The Life expectancy is in almost minimal range and is quite predictable in the ages when the employee is in the accredited employment of the Bank for the purpose of the Gratuity. Thus, the risk of life expectancy is almost negligible. However, had a post-retirement benefit been given by the Bank like monthly pension, post-retirement medical etc., this would have been a significant risk which would have been quite difficult to value even by using advance mortality improvement models.

The withdrawal risk is dependent upon the: benefit structure; age and retention profile of the staff; the valuation methodology; and long-term valuation assumptions. In this case, it is not a significant risk.

## Chunk 621

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

# Other risks

Though, not imminent and observable, over long term there are some risks that may crystallize. These includes:

- Retention risk – The risk that employee will not be motivated to continue the service or start working with the Bank if no market comparable retirement benefit is provided.
- Final Salary Risk – The risk, for defined benefit gratuity, that any disproportionate salary merit increases in later service years will give rise to multiplicative increase in the gratuity liability as such increase is applicable to all the past years of service.
- Model Risk – The defined benefit gratuity liability is usually actuarially valued each year. Further, the assets in the Gratuity Fund are also marked to market. This two-tier valuation gives rise to the model risk.
- Operational Risk related to a separate entity - Retirement benefits are funded through a separate trust fund which is a different legal entity than the Bank. Generally, the protocols, processes and conventions used throughout the Bank are not applicable or are not actively applied to the retirement benefit Funds. This gives rise to some specific operational risks.
- Compliance Risk – The risk that retirement benefits offered by the Bank does not comply with minimum statutory requirements.
- Legal/Political Risk – The risk that the legal/political environment changes and the Bank is required to offer additional or different retirement benefits than what the Bank projected.

# 41 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified under held to collect model, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified under held to collect model are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 41.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Ijara Sukuk|Fair values of GoP Ijara Sukuk are derived using the PKISRV rates announced by the Financial Markets Association of Pakistan (FMAP) through Reuters and GIS revaluation rates issued by PSX. These rates denote an average of quotes received from different pre-defined / approved dealers / brokers.|
|Unlisted ordinary shares|Break-up value is determined on the basis of the NAV of the company using the latest available financial statements.|
|Sukuk Certificates|Sukuk certificates are determined using the MUFAP or PSX rates.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
|Derivative instruments|The Bank enters into derivative contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations.|
|Mutual funds|Units of mutual funds are valued using the net asset value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).|
|Property and equipment (land and buildings)|Land and buildings and NBA are revalued by professionally qualified valuers of the Bank. The valuations, mentioned above, are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation experts use a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Banks properties. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties.|

Capital adequacy is regularly monitored by the Bank’s management, employing techniques based on the guidelines developed by the Basel Committee and as per the requirements of the SBP. The required information is submitted to the SBP on a quarterly basis.

Since December 31, 2021, the SBP requires each bank or banking group to: (a) hold the minimum level of the paid-up capital of Rs 10 billion; (b) maintain a ratio of total regulatory capital to the risk-weighted assets at or above the required minimum level of 10% and (c) maintain common equity tier I (CET1) ratio and tier 1 ratio of 6% and 7.5% respectively. An additional capital conservation buffer (CCB) of 1.5% (to be met from CET1) has to be maintained over and above the minimum required level.

The paid-up capital of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2024, stood at Rs 15.177 billion (2023: Rs 15.177 billion). As at December 31, 2024, the Bank's CAR stood at 16.54% (December 31, 2023: 17.46%) whereas CET1 and Tier 1 ratios both stood at 13.21% (December 31, 2023: 14.59%).

The Bank is also in compliance with the capital conservation buffer requirements.

The Bank calculates capital requirement as per Basel III regulatory framework, using the following approaches:

- Credit Risk: Standardised Approach
- Market Risk: Standardised Approach
- Operational Risk: Basic Indicator Approach

# 46 RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk management group (RMG) has been organised under the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). It has been authorised by the Board of Directors (BoD) to monitor the implementation of an integrated risk management framework across the Bank. As an ongoing exercise to integrate risk related functions, RMG has been expanded, strengthened and entrusted to monitor the risk areas across the organisation, including adoption and convergence towards regulatory and Basel guidelines on risk management.

The primary objective of this architecture is to inculcate risk management into the organisation flows to ensure that risks are timely and accurately identified and assessed, properly documented, approved and adequately monitored and managed in order to ensure that risk taking activities are in line with the guidelines approved by the BoD and to protect the interests of the Bank’s depositors and shareholders.

The 'risk management framework' at the Bank encompasses:

- scope of risks to be managed;
- process, systems and procedures to manage risk; and
- roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in risk management.

The Bank has adopted an approach that gives an integrated view of the risks faced by the organisation. This calls for aligning strategic vision, policy objectives and business processes / procedures within the risk management framework.

The management of risk is integrated with the Bank's management of capital and strategy. This ensures that risks taken in pursuit of the Bank’s strategic objectives are consistent with the policies, translating into targeted shareholder return as well as the Bank’s desired credit rating and risk appetite.

With this in view, the risk management framework endeavours to be a comprehensive and evolving set of guidelines to cater to changing business dynamics. The risk management framework includes:

- clearly defined risk management policies;
- well constituted organisational structure; and
- mechanism for ongoing review of all policies and procedures and risk exposures.

The 'risk management framework' is built on the following elements:

- comprehensive risk governance; and
- effective risk processes.

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

The Bank has developed and implemented a governance and management structure, processes surrounding each risk area, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, capital management, operational risk, environmental & social risk, Shari'ah non-compliance risk and information security risk.

The essential components which contribute in effective management of all these risks are as follows:

- active board / senior management strategic direction and centralised RMG oversight;
- sufficient policies, procedures and limits;
- adequate risk measurement, monitoring and management information systems; and
- comprehensive internal controls.

The Board of Directors (BoD) monitoring and oversight is facilitated through the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC), comprising of directors including the President & CEO. It is appointed and authorised by the BoD to assist in the design, regular evaluation and timely updation of the risk management framework. The BRMC has further authorised management committees such as Country Credit Committee (CCC), Agriculture Credit Committee (ACC), Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC) and Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO) to supervise risk management activities within their respective areas.

In order to have an effective and efficient risk assessment, and to closely align its functions with business, RMG has separate risk management functions for credit risk management, based on the specialised skill sets and required specific experience in various business segments. These functions comprise of corporate risk, CBSME, agri and retail risk management.

The common responsibilities of all credit risk management functions include:

- conduct a thorough and an independent due diligence of the proposed / existing exposures in the respective risk portfolios.
- work with compliance department of the Bank to ensure conformity to the relevant Government regulations, the SBP PRs as well as internal policies.
- work with relationship teams to structure exposures such that they mitigate key risks, cater to customer requirements, remain economical in terms of risk weighted assets / capital allocation to ensure adequate risk coverage.

The risk management architecture is further fostered by enterprise risk management, risk policy, analytics & ESG, information security function and an independent credit administration department.

The enterprise risk management function is responsible for managing and controlling market, operational and liquidity risks at an enterprise level and monitoring regulatory capital requirements of the Bank.

Credit administration department - independent from the Risk Management function - looks after the security, financing documentation, disbursement and post disbursement monitoring aspects of the credit portfolio.

Risk policy, analytics & ESG department serves as an independent check in the risk management function. It performs periodic review of all credit related portfolios (corporate, CBSME, retail, agri, SAM) and analyses portfolio compositions, risk rating distributions, emerging trends of NPLs, renewal status of Risk Approvals (RAs) as per policy and other policy related matters. It also formulates / updates credit policies (along with various limits prescribed therein) in line with regulatory environment, business strategy, the BoD approvals and the best practices.

Moreover, the Green Banking Office (GBO) has been consolidated under the Risk Policy, Analytics & ESG umbrella at FBL. Established in accordance with the State Bank of Pakistan’s Green Banking Guidelines (Circular #08 of IH&SMEFD, dated October 09, 2017), the GBO operates within the Risk function to oversee the entity-wide implementation of Green Banking and ESG initiatives. This office is responsible for the day-to-day management of green banking activities at FBL.

and supports the integration of ESG considerations into business decision-making. The GBO ensures the Bank's compliance with SBP's Green Banking Guidelines, FBL's Green Banking Policy, and any other relevant regulatory directives.

The information security risk function is responsible for information security risk identification, monitoring and reporting.

## Chunk 649

# 46.1 Credit risk

Credit risk is the identification of probability that a counterparty will cause a financial loss to the Bank due to its inability or unwillingness to meet its contractual obligation. This credit risk arises mainly from both direct financing activities as well as contingent liabilities.

The Bank’s credit risk philosophy is based on the Bank’s overall business strategy / direction as established by the Board. The Bank is committed to the appropriate level of due diligence to ensure that credit risks have been properly analysed, fully disclosed to the approving authorities, appropriately rated, appropriately structured, appropriately priced and documented.

The Bank deals with many different types of obligors/customers and financing structures across the corporate, commercial, SME, agriculture and retail segments. The Bank manages customer credit risk exposures within appropriate limits to ensure that it does not provide a disproportionate level of credit to a single customer or group of connected clients. The Bank follows aggregation principles – summing of credit risk limits to the same customer, or group of connected clients – to identify and manage effectively all significant credit risk exposures to a single customer within an individual business and, where appropriate, across other business segments.

The Bank has well-defined credit approval and review processes under which senior officers with the requisite credit background, critically scrutinise, advise and discuss associated risks and recommend / review / approve credit facilities and financing, through respective credit committees. Besides financial, industry and transaction analysis, in order to quantify risks of counterparty, the credit evaluation also includes risk rating system to evaluate risk rating of the customers which is then monitored on a portfolio basis to gauge the Bank’s credit portfolio quality. To avoid risk concentration, counterparty limits, counterparty group limits and industry concentration limits are also established, monitored and assessed in the light of changing counterparty and market conditions.

With a view to develop and effectively manage a diversified credit portfolio within each business segment (as an integral part of the credit risk management process), the Bank has adopted the concept of an industry / sector-wise exposure concentration grid which dictates target market exposures.

As part of the Bank’s portfolio strategy and planning activity, these industry concentration limits are continually overseen by the management against the Bank’s approved exposures in these sectors and reviewed by the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) in its meetings with an aim to monitor the overall risk and to avoid high exposure to a single group or industry.

The Bank is regularly conducting credit portfolio reviews to assess early warning signs, with robust post disbursement credit review mechanism to identify obligors/customers most likely to be affected in the challenging business and economic environment. Bank is confident that it has adequate capacity to withstand challenges.

The Bank uses the Standardised Approach to calculate capital charge for credit risk as per Basel regulatory framework, with comprehensive approach for credit risk mitigation.

Stress testing for credit risk is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of increase in non performing financing and downward shift in these categories.

# 46.1.1 Segment by class of business

Credit Risk Management (CRM) Framework (non-individual portfolio) covers three business segments: corporate risk management, commercial banking and SME (including agri) risk management. Based on overall guidance provided by a recognised and established external consultant, in line with the global best practices while ensuring regulatory compliance and alleviation of any (perceived) conflict of interest, credit management process has been segregated into

Annual Report 2024  315

## Chunk 651

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

two distinct categories:

- independent risk advice by risk management function.
- credit approvals by credit committee(s), while taking into consideration the business unit recommendations / approvals and independent risk advice.

With this segregation, the role of risk management function in credit approval process is focused to provide risk advice only, based on key risk parameters; whereas relevant credit committees are responsible for providing credit related approvals.

The common responsibilities of corporate risk management and commercial banking and SME (including agri) risk management include:

- conduct a thorough and an independent due diligence of the proposed / existing exposures in the respective risk portfolios.
- work with relationship teams to advise on structure of exposures such that they mitigate key risks, cater to customer requirements, remain economical in terms of risk weighted assets / capital allocation to ensure risk coverage.
- work with the independent credit risk review team (under internal audit) for effective and periodic review of the credit portfolio.

Retail risk management is responsible for managing the credit risk of consumer finance credit products, with credit facilities extended to individual (non-corporate) customers. The consumer finance function operates on a program approach, which are approved by the Country Credit Committee and subsequently by the BoD. The retail risk management provides its input on risk parameters in term of 'risk advice', at the time of approval / changes in product programs. The retail risk management also ensures that all the ongoing individual credit approvals are within pre-defined risk parameters as per the approved product programs.

# 46.1.2 Credit risk: general disclosures Basel specific

The Bank has adopted the standardised approach under Basel. According to the regulatory statement submitted under the standardised approach, the portfolio has been divided into claims on public sector entities in Pakistan (PSEs), claims on corporate (excluding equity exposure) and claims categorised as retail portfolio. Claims on corporate constitute 61.38% (2023: 59.45%) of the total credit risk weighted assets, 2.30% (2023: 1.27%) represents claims on PSEs and 14.86% (2023: 13.91%) exposure pertains to claims categorised as retail portfolio.

## Chunk 653

# 46.1.3 Credit risk: disclosures for portfolio subject to standardised approach

For domestic claims, external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs) recommended by the SBP, namely Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) and VIS Credit Rating Company Limited are used. For claims on foreign entities, ratings assigned by Standard and Poor, Fitch and Moody's are used. Exposures not rated by any of the aforementioned rating agencies are categorised as unrated.

# 46.1.9 Forward-looking information contained in ECL

The Bank's Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculation incorporates forward-looking information by integrating macroeconomic variables to enhance the accuracy and reliability of credit risk estimates. The use of forward-looking data helps in better predicting potential credit losses under different economic conditions.

To estimate Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD), the Bank utilizes historical and forecasted macroeconomic data. For ECL calculations, the Bank considers Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) as the primary macroeconomic variables, with forecasted data sourced from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The selection of these variables is based on their relevance and sensitivity to specific portfolios.

The Bank has developed three macroeconomic scenarios—Base, Best, and Worst—to reflect potential economic conditions. These scenarios have been assigned probability weightings of 60% for the Base scenario, 10% for the Best scenario, and 30% for the Worst scenario to ensure a comprehensive assessment of credit risk exposure.

As part of its forward-looking assessment, the Bank conducted a sensitivity analysis on macroeconomic indicators used in Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculations. As of December 31, 2024, the Bank developed three scenarios—Base, Best, and Worst—based on a five-year forecast. A 10% change in macroeconomic variables (GDP and CPI) in the Base scenario was applied to assess the upside and downside impact on PD / ECL. The resulting variations across different segments are as follows:

# 46.2 Market Risk

It is the risk that the value of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions of the Bank will be adversely affected by movements in market rates or prices such as benchmark rates, deposit rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and / or commodity prices resulting in a loss to earnings and capital. Market risks arise generally from trading activities, open foreign currency positions, holding common equity and other products. All such instruments and transactions are exposed to general and specific market movements.

The Bank seeks to mitigate market risk by employing strategies that correlate price, rate and spread movements of its earning assets, liabilities and trading activities. Treasury front office, market risk management and treasury middle office perform market risk management activities within the Bank. The Bank has Enterprise Risk Management Committee which is responsible for recommending market risk policies and strategies for the Board approval and its subsequent implementation and review.

# 46.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk / currency risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in currency exchange rates. It refers to the impact of adverse movements in currency exchange rates on the value of open foreign currency positions. Changes in currency rates affect the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and may affect revenues from foreign exchange dealing.

The Bank undertakes currency risk mostly to support its trade services and maintains overall foreign exchange risk position to the extent of statutory Foreign Exchange Exposure Limit (FEEL) prescribed by the SBP. Exposure limits such as counterparty, gap, net open position, dealer and bucket-wise currency delta limits are in place in accordance with the Bank’s approved policies in order to manage associated risk and concentration at the acceptable tolerance levels.

# 46.2.3 Equity position Risk

Equity position risk is the risk arising from unfavourable fluctuations in prices of shares in which the Bank carries positions. It is a risk to earnings or capital that results from adverse changes in the value of equity related portfolios of the Bank. Price risk associated with equities could be systematic or unsystematic. Systematic risk is due to sensitivity of portfolio’s value to changes in overall level of equity prices, while unsystematic risk is associated with price volatility that is determined by the specific characteristics of the investee company.

The Bank's equity position is governed by position limits imposed by the SBP for overall investment and per scrip exposure. Additionally, there are internal limits set to manage overall earnings in the form of stop loss limits and maintain a diverse portfolio through sector concentration limits.

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

Yield curve risk is the risk that a financial instrument will suffer either a decline in income or capital because future changes in prevailing profit rates of return impact assets more or less than they impact liabilities.

The profit rate risk of the Bank arises when there is a mismatch between contractual maturities, which are subject to profit rate adjustment within a specified period or re-pricing of on and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities. Risk is addressed by Asset and Liability Management Committee that reviews the profit rate dynamics at regular intervals and decides re-pricing of assets and liabilities to ensure that the spread of the Bank remains at an acceptable level.

Major sources of Profit rate risk are;

1. differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (re-pricing risk);
2. changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting the Bank's activities (basis risk);
3. changing rate relationships across the range of maturities (yield curve risk);
4. Profit-related options embedded in the Bank's products (options risk); and
5. changes in marked-to-market value of financial instruments which occur when profit rate changes (price risk).

# 46.3 Operational risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors or from external events. The Bank’s businesses are dependent on the ability to process a large number of transactions efficiently and accurately. Operational risks and losses originate from business / operational process failure, IT security failure, natural disasters, dependence on key suppliers, fraud, service quality compromises, regulatory non-compliance, loss of key staff and social and environmental impacts.

The operational risk management department is primarily responsible for the oversight of operational risk management across the Bank. The operational risk management framework of the Bank is governed by the operational risk management policy and procedures, while the implementation is supported by an operational risk management system and designated operational risk coordinators within different units across the Bank. The framework is in line with international best practices, flexible enough to implement in stages and permits the overall approach to evolve in response to organizational learning and future requirements.

The Bank has implemented an effective operational risk management framework for managing operational risk. Each department has processes and system controls in place to address operational risks within their area. Operational loss data is collected through a well defined program implemented across the Bank. Periodic workshops are conducted for risk and control self assessment and key risk exposures are identified and assessed against existing controls to evaluate improvement opportunities. Key risk indicators are also defined for monitoring of risk exposures. New products, systems, activities and processes are subject to comprehensive operational risk assessments, before implementation. Regular updates on operational risk status is presented to Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC) and the Board of Directors through the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC). Further, as part of Bank’s ongoing commitment to enhance Bank’s services and to ensure Bank-wide risk awareness culture, Operational Risk Management Department has also organized special workshops / classroom trainings tailored for Pan Pakistan Branch Operations Team.

# Operational risk-disclosures Basel II specific

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.

The Bank is currently using basic indicator approach for calculating operational risk capital charge. Under basic indicator approach the capital charge for operational risk is a fixed percentage (denoted alpha) of average positive annual gross income of the Bank over the past three years. Figures for any year in which annual gross income is negative or zero, should be excluded from both the numerator and denominator when calculating the average.

# 46.5 Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank will be unable to meet its payment obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they fall due and to replenish funds when they are withdrawn.

Liquidity risk management framework is governed by the liquidity risk management policy. The policy provides specific directives for measuring and managing liquidity risk identifies responsible personnel; and defines their respective roles and responsibilities relating to liquidity risk management.

The management of liquidity risk is accomplished through a formal structure which includes:

- Board of Directors (BoD)
- Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC)
- Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO)
- Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC)
- Treasury
- Risk management (enterprise risk management)
- Finance

The BoD approves the liquidity risk management policy including risk limits and ensures, through quarterly reviews by the BRMC, that the Bank's liquidity risk is being managed prudently. The BRMC plays a strategic role in liquidity risk management by overseeing the liquidity risk profile of the Bank. ERMC defines the risk tolerance levels and setting risk limits for effective liquidity risk management. ALCO ensures adherence with policy requirements and risk limits so that the Bank remains sufficiently liquid at all times.

The market and liquidity risk under enterprise risk management function overseas liquidity risk. The Bank’s Asset and Liability Committee manages the liquidity position on a continuous basis.

The Bank ensures to maintain a diversified portfolio of liquid assets and funding base. Sources of funding comprise of a good mix of core deposits. Concentration in deposit, especially large volume deposits, is closely monitored to anticipate any potential liquidity issues in case of their withdrawals.

Various tools and techniques are used to measure and monitor the possible liquidity risk. These include monitoring of different liquidity ratios like liquid assets to liquid liabilities, liquid assets to total deposits, large volume deposits to total deposits, financing to deposit, liquid assets to volatile funding; on a regular basis against defined limits. Further, liquidity gaps over different time bands, are also monitored through maturity profiling of assets and liabilities. The Bank also ensures that statutory cash and liquidity requirements are maintained at all times. In addition, the Bank has also implemented the SBP's Basel III liquidity standards for ensuring compliance with the requirements of LCR, NSFR and other monitoring tools.

The Bank performs liquidity stress testing on periodic basis in order to ensure sufficient liquidity is always available to meet financial obligations / commitments. Stress testing aims to quantify the potential impact of extreme yet plausible events or movements on the value of portfolio. Shocks include withdrawal of deposits, withdrawal of wholesale / large deposits, withdrawal of top deposits, etc. The results of liquidity stress testing are shared with relevant authorities / committees, on periodic basis.

Contingency funding plan (CFP) is a part of liquidity risk management policy of the Bank. CFP provides a set of several early warning indicators of a possible liquidity shortfall situation; describes the actions to be taken to manage it and identifies the roles and responsibilities of ALCO, CFP team or other relevant authorities.

reporting to the Chief Risk Officer. The risk management policies are governed by the regulatory and internal guidelines.

be carried out. Furthermore, Banks' derivative portfolio is on run off basis due to conversion. Adherence to these limits is
ensured through independent monitoring and control functions.

risks includes the following primary components:

- comprehensive risk measurement approach;
- detailed structure of limits, guidelines and other parameters used to govern risk taking; and

Major risks associated with the derivative instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Bank uses FIS-
System to measure and manage these risks which provides end-to-end capability with respect to transaction life cycle.

The Group has maintained its growth trajectory, achieving excellent financial performance and unprecedented growth. Despite numerous challenges, the Group has consistently proven its resilience and strength, celebrating the milestone of reaching the highest-ever profit. As we reflect on our journey, we must first and foremost thank Allah (SWT) for His Blessings without which none of our achievements would have been possible. On a consolidated basis, the Group has achieved a record-breaking Profit Before Tax (PBT) of PKR 51.8 billion, 23.7% higher than PKR 41.8 billion in the last year. The increase in Profit After Tax (PAT) was, however, restricted to 18.0% at PKR 23.9 billion due to imposition of an excessive income tax of 5%, which raised the tax rate from 49% to 54%. The earnings per share rose to PKR 15.74, an increase from PKR 13.34 per share, a year ago.

FAML demonstrated continued improvement in performance, with Assets Under Management (AUMs) reaching PKR 246 billion as of December 31, 2024, reflecting 84% increase from PKR 134 billion last year. FAML made Profit After Tax of PKR 846 million during 2024 registering a 88% increase over last year.

FIECL has started its operations during the year and remained operative for 7 months in the financial year as the State Bank of Pakistan’s pre-commencement requirements were completed by 16th of May 2024. The company earned Profit after Tax of PKR 31 million during 2024.

# Key Audit Matter

As per the BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023, the Bank adopted requirements of IFRS 9 along with the Application Instructions issued by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) (hereafter referred as “application instruction of IFRS 9”) from 1 January 2024 which requires the Bank to recognize Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on Islamic financing and related assets and off-balance sheet items. The estimation of ECL involves judgement and complexity.

The key areas which are subject to complexity and judgement in the estimation of ECL are:

- Model estimations – judgmental modelling and assumption are used to estimate ECL which involves determining Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD). Respective models assumptions are key driver of uncertainty, and are required in the application of these model for calculation of the ECL estimate.
- Economic scenarios – IFRS 9 requires the Bank to measure ECL on an unbiased forward-looking basis reflecting a range of future economic conditions. Complex Statistical methodology is applied in determining the forward-looking economic scenarios used as an input to calculate ECL, the associated scenario probability weightings, and the key economic variables that drive the scenarios.
- Qualitative criteria – the criteria selected to identify a SICR involves judgment and can lead to unreliable ECL recognized for certain portfolios.

In line with the application instructions of IFRS 9, the Bank must compare the ECL for Stage 3 with the provision determined under the Prudential Regulations (PR) issued by the SBP. The PR requires specific provisioning against the Islamic financing and related assets on the basis of time-based criteria which should be supplemented by a Bank’s subjective evaluation of credit worthiness of customers. The determination of provision, therefore, involves use of management’s judgement, on a case-to-case basis, taking into account factors such as the economic and business conditions, borrowers’ financial statement.

# How the matter was addressed in our audit

As part of these risk assessment procedures, identifying the elements associated with risk of material misstatement on application including those arising from judgements over the estimation of ECL either due to, methods / models, assumptions or data.

- Assessing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls established by the Group over measurement of ECL and provision calculated as per PR.
- We involved in-house specialist who assisted in the following:
- Evaluating the Group’s ECL model methodologies for compliance with application instructions of IFRS 9
- Assessing the reasonableness of the Group’s methodology for determining the economic scenarios used and the probability weightings applied to them by independently validating and challenging the assumption, methodologies, and outputs of the models;
- Assessing the reasonableness of macro-economic variable and economic forecasts by comparing these to external sourced data extracted; and
- Performing independent testing of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) allowance on a sample basis.
- Assessing the appropriateness of SICR criteria applied by the Group by ensuring that the SICR criteria and staging methodology are consistent with the application instructions of IFRS 9.
- Ensuring relevance and completeness of the key inputs into the ECL calculations with their respective sub-ledgers and general ledgers.
- Performing testing on sample basis over key inputs into the ECL calculations with their respective source documents.
- Performing sensitivity analysis on the key

# Key Audit Matter

# 1. Repayment Behaviors and Realizability of Collateral

Because of the high degree of estimation uncertainty and complexity involved in the calculation of ECL, we considered the area of ECL as a key audit matter.

How the matter was addressed in our audit:

- In accordance with the PR, we sampled at least sixty percent of the total Islamic and financing assets outstanding exposure and performed credit reviews through the following substantive procedures:
- - Verifying repayments of Islamic financing/profit installments and checked that non-performing Islamic financing and related assets have been correctly classified and categorized based on the number of days overdue;
- Examining watch list accounts and, based on review of the individual facts and circumstances, discussions with management and our assessment of financial conditions of the borrowers, formed a judgement as to whether classification of these accounts as performing was appropriate;
- Assessing the accuracy of specific provision made against non-performing Islamic financing and related assets in accordance with the criteria prescribed under the PRs by performing recalculation.

Assessing the appropriateness of ECL categorized as Stage 3 by performing a comparison of ECL computed, through the use of methodology and models with the provision required to be computed as required under the PR to ensure that an amount which is higher of the ECL and PR requirements is appropriately recognized for these stage 3 customers pursuant to the requirement of application instructions of IFRS 9.
- Evaluating the adequacy of the financial statement disclosures, including disclosures of key assumptions, judgements and sensitivities.

# Information Other than the Consolidated and Unconsolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Reports Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements and our auditor’s reports thereon. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Chunk 738

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan and the Companies Act, 2017 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

## Chunk 739

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.
- Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Ÿ  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Zeeshan Rashid.

# 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION

# 2.1

The Holding Company provides financing mainly through Murabaha, Musawamah, Istisna and other Islamic modes as briefly explained in note 6.8 to these consolidated financial statements. The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these consolidated financial statement as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilized and the appropriate portion of profit thereon. The income on such financing is recognized as accordance with the principles of Islamic Shari'ah. However income, if any, received which does not comply with the principles of Islamic Shari'ah, is recognised as charity payable if so directed by the Shari'ah Board of the Holding Company.

---

## Chunk 752

# 2.2 Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Bank and the financial statements of the Subsidiary Companies from the date from which control of the Subsidiary Companies by the Group commences until the date on which control ceases. The financial statements of the Subsidiary Companies are incorporated on a line-by-line basis and the investment held by the Bank is eliminated against the corresponding share capital and pre-acquisition reserve of the Subsidiary Companies in the consolidated financial statements. The financial statements of the Subsidiary Companies are prepared for the same reporting period as the Holding Company, using accounting policies that are generally consistent with those of the Holding Company. Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost, thereafter for the post acquisition change in the Group's share of net assets of the associates. The consolidated profit and loss account reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associate. These consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of income and expenses of associates from the date that significant influence commences until the date that such influence ceases. Non-controlling interest is that part of the net results of operations and of net assets of the subsidiary attributable to interests which are not owned by the Holding Company. All material intra-group balances and transactions have been eliminated.

# 3 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

# 3.1

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for financial reporting. The accounting and reporting standards applicable in Pakistan for financial reporting comprise of:

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of, and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IFRS or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has adopted requirements of IFRS 9 along with the application instructions through BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023, dated April 13, 2023, but deferred certain requirements. The requirement to carry unquoted securities at fair value has been deferred until January 1, 2025. Furthermore, Islamic banking institutions have been allowed to follow Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) 1 & 2 where applicable and continue existing accounting practices for other Islamic products until further instructions. The impact of profit of financing in advance stage is Rs. 1,504 million excluding any Effective yield rate (EIR) effect as the Holding Company has received deferment of recording income and expense at EIR via letter from SBP till 31 December 2025. Consequently, these deferred requirements of IFRS 9 have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the Holding Company is required to apply modification accounting retrospectively however it will be applied only on the financing modified on or after 1st January 2020 as allowed by SBP.

The SBP allowed the Holding company to adjust the amortisation of intangible assets against the portion of reserve which arose on account of such assets identified as a result of such acquisition. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Holding company has adjusted an amortisation of intangible assets net of tax amounting to Rs. 52.650 million (2023: Rs. 68.968 million) from the NCR.

These reporting requirements have not been notified to date. Accordingly, the disclosure requirements under IFAS 3 have not been considered in these consolidated financial statements.

## Chunk 756

# 3.4

The SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment property' for Banking Companies through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002 till further instructions. Further, the SECP has also deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, 'Financial instruments: disclosures' through its S.R.O. 633(I)/2014 dated July 10, 2014. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.

---

## Chunk 757

# 3.5

The SECP through S.R.O. 56(1)/2016 dated January 28, 2016, has directed that the requirements of IFRS 10, 'Consolidated financial statements' are not applicable in case of investments by companies in mutual funds established under Trust Deed structure.

# 3.7.4  Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting and reporting standards as applicable
in Pakistan requires the use of certain accounting estimates. It also requires the management to exercise judgement in
the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are
based on historical experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The areas
where various assumptions and estimates are significant to the Group's financial statements or where judgement was
exercised in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

- i)    Business combinations (note 6.1);
- ii)   Classification of investments (note 6.4.2 and 9);
- iii)  Valuation of financial assets and liabilities as per IFRS 9, associates and joint ventures (note 6.4.2);
- iv)   Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance (notes 6.4.10);
- v)    Valuation and depreciation of property and equipment (note 6.9 and 11.2);
- vi)   Taxation (note 6.11 and note 34);
- vii)  Valuation of non-banking asset acquired in satisfaction of claims (note 6.12 and 14);
- viii) Valuation of defined benefit plan (note 6.14 and 38);
- ix)   Valuation and depreciation of right-of-use assets and their related lease liability (note 6.26, 12 and 18).

Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only
that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

## Chunk 766

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

# 6.1 Business Combinations

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. The cost of acquisition is measured as the
fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued and the liabilities incurred or assumed as at the date of acquisition.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement, if any. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values as at the acquisition
date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the Group's share of identifiable net assets
acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired in the case of a bargain
purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated profit and loss account. However, as more fully
described in note 13.3 to these consolidated financial statements, the gain on bargain purchase arising on an acquisition
made in 2010 has been recognised directly in equity as per the directives of the SBP.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is measured, subsequent to initial recognition, at its cost less accumulated
impairment losses, if any. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is tested for impairment annually or whenever
there is an indication of impairment as per the requirements of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 36, 'Impairment of
assets'. Impairment charge in respect of goodwill is recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account and is not
subsequently reversed.

Acquisition of non-controlling interests (NCI) is measured at the proportionate share of the NCI in the fair value of the net
assets acquired by the Group. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the proportionate share of
the NCI in the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognised in equity. (Referring to the 'Reserve arising on
amalgamation').

# 6.2 Cash and cash equivalents

For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash in hand, balances
with treasury banks, balances with other banks in current and deposit accounts and overdrawn nostro accounts.

In Bai Muajjal, the Holding Company sells Shari'ah compliant instruments on credit to other financial institutions. The

IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments (Applicable on or after January 1, 2024)

During the period, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9: ‘Financial Instruments' (the Standard) as adopted by the SBP became applicable to the Holding Company. BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 issued by SBP provides detailed instructions on implementation of IFRS 9 (the IFRS 9 Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across the banks. Furthermore, SBP wide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 and SBP wide BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 has made further amendments in the application instructions issued. All deferments made through these amendments are disclosed in statement of compliance.

The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘expected credit losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Holding Company which are exposed to credit risk.

The Holding Company has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the IFRS 9 Application Instructions from January 1, 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at January 1, 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard.

Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

# 6.4.1 Impact on regulatory capital

In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the “transitional adjustment amount”) must be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the “transition period” of five years.

Had IFRS 9 not been applied then estimated CAR would have been lower by 21 bps from 16.74% to 16.53%. The Group has applied the transitional arrangement on Regulatory Capital. Had the transitional arrangement not been applied then CAR would have been higher by 22 bps from 16.74% to 16.96%. The Holding Company has applied the transitional arrangement on Regulatory Capital. Had the transitional arrangement not been applied than Leverage Ratio would have been lower by 06 bps from 4.53% to 4.47%.

## Chunk 772

# 6.4.2 Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and profit (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) regardless of the business model in which they are held.

---

## Chunk 773

# Recognition and initial measurement

Debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Holding Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at transaction price. The fair value of a financial asset on initial recognition is generally its transaction price. If the Holding Company determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognized in profit and loss account on an appropriate basis over the life of the asset but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data, or the transaction is closed out. Islamic financing and related assets other than staff financing and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) are initially measured at transaction price i.e., the amount of financing disbursed at disbursement date.

---

## Chunk 774

# Classification of Financial Assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as either amortized cost, FVOCI, or FVPL whereas Islamic financing and related assets except for staff financing, the Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), and modified financing, are carried at cost.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets; and
---

---

## Chunk 775

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

Islamic financing and related assets are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, except for Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), staff financing and modified financing, which are measured at amortized cost.

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business models for managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following changes in the business model.

IFRS 9 allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any 'accounting mismatch' that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different basis. SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout life of the instrument.

---

## Chunk 776

# Classification of Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit and loss account (FVPL), when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortized cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognized in profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortized cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective yield rate method. Profit and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 777

# 6.4.3 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either Held to collect, Held to collect and sale and Others based on Business model assessment. The Holding Company makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The assessment requires judgement based on facts and circumstances on the date of assessment. The assessment considers the policies and objectives for the portfolio of financial assets, risk affecting, performance evaluation, business manager’s compensation and historical sales information.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

---

## Chunk 778

# 6.4.4 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and profit (SPPI)

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Profit’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as profit margin.

The Holding Company assesses whether the contractual cash flows of a financial asset meet the Solely Payments of Principal and Profit (SPPI) criterion by examining the contractual terms. This includes checking for terms that could alter the amount and timings of cash flows, such as contingent events, leverage, or prepayment features, etc.

A prepayment feature aligns with SPPI if it mainly represents unpaid principal and profit, including reasonable compensation for early termination.

For fixed-rate financings with periodic profit rate resets, the Holding Company considers these SPPI-compliant as the revised rates reflect time value, credit risk, and other associated risks.

# 6.4.5 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

|Financial assets at FVPL|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any profit or dividend income, are recognised in statement of profit or loss account.|
|---|---|
|Financial assets at amortised cost|These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective yield method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Profit and impairment are recognised in statement of profit or loss account.|
|Debt investments at FVOCI|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and is assessed for impairment under the new ECL model. Profit income is calculated using the effective yield method and includes amortization of premiums and accretion of discount and impairment are recognised in profit and loss account. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to consolidated statement of profit or loss account.|
|Equity investments at FVOCI|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are adjusted from the carrying value of investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to consolidated statement of profit or loss account.|
|Unquoted Securities|Unquoted equity securities are valued at the lower of cost and break-up value. The break-up value of these securities is calculated with reference to the net assets of the investee company as per the latest available audited financial statements. The Holding Company may also use unaudited or management accounts to determine if any additional deficit needs to be charged.|
|Islamic financing and related assets at cost|Islamic financing and related assets are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, except for Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and staff financing, modified financing which are carried at amortized cost, net of expected credit loss allowances.|

---

## Chunk 780

# 6.4.6 Amortised cost and gross carrying amount

The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective yield method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance (or impairment allowance before 1 January 2024).

The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

# 6.4.7 Calculation of profit income and expense

Income is recorded in accordance with IFAS 1 and IFAS 2. Furthermore, for other Islamic products income is recorded based on the contractual rate in accordance with the Shari'ah principles. Profit expense on domestic financial liabilities (comprising deposits and borrowings) is recognized on an accrual basis in the period in which it is incurred, based on their contractual rates.

---

## Chunk 782

# 6.4.8 Derecognition

The Group derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognized), and the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in OCI is recognized in the profit and loss account, except that in case of the derecognition of equity securities held at FVOCI, cumulative gains or losses are transferred to unappropriated profit.

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Holding Company also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

---

## Chunk 783

# 6.4.9 Modification

Financial assets

The Group sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognized and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs.

If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms.

If the Group plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

Where derecognition of financial assets is appropriate, the newly recognised residual financing are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classified as purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI).

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the Group first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective yield rate of the asset and recognised the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit and loss account.

If such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as profit income calculated using the effective yield rate method.

## Chunk 784

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

# Financial liabilities

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability recognised and consideration paid is recognised in profit and loss account.

If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective yield rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit and loss account. For floating-rate financial liabilities, the original effective yield rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective yield rate on the instrument.

---

## Chunk 785

# 6.4.10 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain financing commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’).

---

## Chunk 786

# Restructured financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognized and ECL are measured as follows:

- If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset.
- If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective profit yield rate of the existing financial asset.

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in ‘Stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘Stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘Stage 3’.

---

## Chunk 787

# Non-Performing financial assets

At each reporting date, the Holding Company assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘non-performing’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. This includes time based criteria and subjective evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower.

A financing that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail financing that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.

Under the IFRS 9 Application instructions, the Holding Company is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. The Holding Company is required to calculate ECL on its non-performing financial assets as higher of provision under Prudential Regulations (PR) and ECL under IFRS 9.

## Chunk 788

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

The Holding Company calculates the ECL against corporate, commercial & SME financing portfolios as higher of PR and
ECL under IFRS 9 at borrower/facility level, whereas against the retail borrowers the Holding Company calculates the
ECL at higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at segment/product basis as instructed under Annexure-A of BPRD Circular
no 16 of 2024.

ECL is the probability weighted estimate of expected cash shortfalls which is determined by multiplying the probability of
default (PD) with the loss given default (LGD) with the expected exposure at the time of default (EAD). Based on the
requirements of IFRS 9 and Application Instructions, the Holding Company has performed an ECL assessment
considering the following key elements:

---

## Chunk 789

# Probability of default:

The Probability of Default represents the likelihood that a counterparty will default within a specific timeframe, such as 12
months (12-month ECL for Stage 1) or the lifetime of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL for Stage 2). The Holding
Company calculates PD on Islamic financing and related assets which is further bifurcated into retail and non retail
portfolios. Following is the methodology through which non retail and retail PD are calculated:

# Non-Retail PD:

The Holding Company utilizes its internal risk rating system to assign Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) to borrowers. Holding
Company has used a statistical method, for the estimation of TTC PDs associated with each of its Obligor Risk Rating
(ORR).

---

## Chunk 790

# Retail PD:

Holding Company has used the roll-rate method for retail portfolios based on its different risk characteristics and
historical default trends. Holding Company has used historical data to estimate TTC PD for its retail segments.

Moreover, the Holding Company calculates Expected Credit Loss (ECL) on investments and balances with other Holding
Companys by utilizing Probability of Default (PD) data, which tracks corporate credit rating transitions over time. This
historical data helps to assess the likelihood of changes in creditworthiness and defaults.

---

## Chunk 791

# Incorporation of forward-looking information:

Forward looking information is incorporated to convert TTC PD to Point in Time Probability of Default (PiT) PD. The
Holding Company has estimated the PiT PDs in its PD Model. For this purpose, the Holding Company incorporated 5-
year forecasts obtained from the Macro Economic Variable (MEV) database of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

---

## Chunk 792

# Exposure at Default (EAD):

The Holding Company has defined EAD for financial assets carried at an amortized cost equal to principal plus accrued
profit at the default date. Each repayment date is assumed to be a default point in the model, and the ECL is calculated
on the EAD at each repayment date and discounted at the effective yield rate to arrive at the discounted ECL under three
scenarios, i.e, base, worst, and best-case scenarios. The unutilized exposures are multiplied with Credit Conversion
Factors (CCFs) to compute the EAD of revolving facilities. For non revolving facilities, CCF is only applied to unutilized
exposures when the Holding Company doesn’t have unconditional right to revoke the undrawn portion. Additionally, cash
and cash equivalent collateral the Holding Company holds against non-retail facilities are adjusted from the EAD, and
ECL is calculated on the net amount. The Holding Company has developed CCF models for its revolving and non
revolving facilities based on the historical utilization of credit limits which are currently being applied to the revolving
portfolio.

---

## Chunk 793

# Loss Given Default:

Loss Given Default (LGD) represents the forecasted economic loss in the event of default, calculated independently of
credit quality and applied consistently across all stages. LGD is determined as the percentage of loss expected in case
of borrower default, incorporating historical data, cash recovery experience (including settlements), costs and time of
recoveries, collateral realizations, and recovery projections. For non-collateralized portfolios, the Holding Company
estimates LGD based on actual recoveries from defaulted accounts over a historical period of 3-5 years prior to the

Annual Report 2024  371
---

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

Forward-looking information is incorporated into the LGD calculation to reflect the impact of macroeconomic factors on the expected recoveries.

---

## Chunk 794

# Purchase or Originated Credit Impaired Financial Assets

Purchase or Originated Credit Impaired (POCI) financial assets are assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition. Expected credit loss for these assets is not recognized in a separate loss provision on initial recognition, as the lifetime expected credit loss is inherent within the gross carrying amount of the instruments. Consequently, POCI assets do not carry an impairment allowance on initial recognition. The amount recognized as a loss allowance after initial recognition is equal to the changes in lifetime ECL since the initial recognition of the asset.

---

## Chunk 795

# Presentation of allowance for Expected Credit Loss in the Statement of Financial Position

Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the statement of financial position as follows:

- Financial assets measured at amortized cost / cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets.
- Financing commitments and financial guarantee contracts: as a provision in Other Assets / Liabilities.
- Where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Holding Company does not identify the ECL on the financing commitment component separately from those on the drawn component and instead presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision.

---

## Chunk 796

# 6.4.11 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Holding Company used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and/or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations. A financial asset is transitioned to a backward stage in line with SBP instructions.

# 6.4.12 Write-offs

Financial assets are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Holding Company determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level. Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in the statement of profit and loss account. Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Holding Company’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

## Chunk 798

# 6.4.13 Off-setting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are set off and the net amount is reported in the consolidated financial statements only when the Holding Company has a legally enforceable right to set off and the Holding Company intends to either settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and to settle the liabilities simultaneously. Income and expense items of such assets and liabilities are also offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated financial statements only when permitted by the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan.

# 6.4.14 Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Holding Company has adopted a governance framework requiring multiple functions to effectively work together to
ensure input from all business lines. The Risk Department defines the staging criteria for the new impairment model and
take ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach.
Additionally, the Risk department also take the ownership of the impact of ECL on Holding Company's capital. The
Holding Company’s Finance Division performs ECL calculation. As a result, the department then assess the financial
impact, meet the financial reporting requirements and further monitor the impact on the financial ratios.
As per the Holding Company's policy, the Holding Company’s Internal Audit function carries out periodic review of IFRS 9
methodology and impacts calculated by the Management.

# 6.4.15 Undrawn financing commitments and guarantees

Financial guarantees’ are contracts that require the Holding Company to make specified payments to reimburse the
holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the
terms of a debt instrument. ‘financing commitments’ are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms
and conditions.
When estimating lifetime ECL for undrawn financing commitments, the Holding Company estimates the expected portion
of the financing commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value
of the expected cash flows if the financing are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

## Chunk 801

# 6.4.16 Acceptances

Acceptances arise when the Holding Company is under an obligation to make payments against documents drawn
under letters of credit. Acceptances specify the amount of money, the date, and the person to which the payment is due.
After acceptance, the instrument becomes an unconditional liability (time draft) of the Holding Company and is therefore
recognized as a financial liability in the statement of financial position with a corresponding contractual right of
reimbursement from the customer recognized as a financial asset.
Acceptances have been considered within the scope of IFRS 9 ‐ Financial Instruments for the purpose of calculation of
expected credit loss and are valued at amortized cost and continued to be recognized as a financial liability in the
statement of financial position with a contractual right of reimbursement from the customer as a financial asset.

# 6.4.17 Wa’ad / Promissory Contracts

Wa’ad / promissory contracts are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into and
are subsequently re-measured to fair value using appropriate valuation techniques. All Wa’ad / promissory contracts are
carried as assets when fair value is positive and liability when fair value is negative. Any change in the fair value of Wa’ad
/ promissory contracts is taken to the profit and loss account.

# 6.6 Investment in associates

Certain mutual funds are managed by Faysal Asset Management Limited (FAML). As stipulated under Regulation 38 of Non-Banking Finance Regulation, 2008, the Asset Management Company (AMC) is entrusted with fiduciary duties towards the unit holders of the funds. This fiduciary obligation requires AMC to act in the best interests of its unit holders, refraining from exploiting opportunities for its own benefit or that of its related parties, group companies, or employees, to the detriment of the unit holders.

In some cases, the holding of these investments is exceeding 50%. However, due to the exemption provided through SRO 56(i) of 2016, for the purpose of determining subsidiary relation, the definition provided under Companies Act, 2017 is not considered; rather, the definition under IFRS 10 is used. As per IFRS 10, these are not considered subsidiary due to the legal trust structure of the entity; the Group does not have the ability to affect returns through its power over the investee. Further, under this trust structure, the trusteeship is separate from the management, and the independent trustees play a key role in overseeing the activities of the AMC.

The Group has significant influence over mutual funds due to power to participate in the investee's policy-making processes via the FAML, and investment in such mutual funds is considered as investment in associates.

# Subsequent measurement of Associates

Investment in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

Investments other than those classified as held for trading are initially recognised at fair value which includes transaction costs associated with the investments. Investments classified as 'held for trading' are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs associated with the transactions are expensed through the profit and loss account.

Premium or discount on acquisition of investments is amortised through the profit and loss account over the remaining period till maturity using the effective yield rate method.

# 6.7.3  Subsequent measurement

# Held for trading

These are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Any unrealised surplus / deficit arising on revaluation is taken into profit and loss account.

# Held to maturity

These are measured at amortised cost using the effective yield rate method, less any impairment recognised to reflect irrecoverable amounts.

## Chunk 809

# Available for sale

Quoted securities classified as available for sale investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Any surplus or deficit arising thereon is kept in a separate account shown in the statement of financial position within equity and is taken to the profit and loss account when realised upon disposal or when the investments are considered to be impaired.

Unquoted equity securities are valued at the lower of cost and break-up value. The break-up value of these securities is calculated with reference to the net assets of the investee company as per the latest available audited financial statements. The Holding Company may also use unaudited or management accounts to determine if any additional impairment needs to be charged beyond amounts already changed based on audited consolidated financial statements.

Investments in other unquoted securities are valued at cost less impairment, if any.

# 6.7.4  Impairment

Available for sale and held to maturity investments impairment loss in respect of investments classified as available for sale and held to maturity is recognised based on management's assessment of objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that may have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the investments. A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a listed equity investment below its cost is also considered an objective evidence of impairment. The determination of significant or prolonged decline requires judgement.

Provision in the value of term finance certificates and sukuk certificates is made as per the requirements of the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP. In case of impairment of available for sale securities, the cumulative loss that has been recognised in surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities on the statement of financial position within equity is removed therefrom and recognised in the profit and loss account.

All Mudarabah and Musharaka based deposits are fully invested in respective Pools to produce returns for them. In case where FBL Islamic is unable to utilise all funds available for investment, priority is given to the deposit account holders. All remunerative accounts such as remunerative current accounts, saving accounts, investment certificates, etc. are opened on the basis of Mudarabah, Musharaka, Wakalah or a combination of Mudarabah and Musharaka. The return on these deposits is calculated on the basis of Profit and Loss sharing (PLS). Unless specified, all remunerative local currency and foreign currency deposits are taken as General Mudarabah and Musharaka pool.

Profit share is determined by using weightages and profit sharing ratio assigned to each category of deposit within a pool. These weightages and profit sharing ratios are declared by FBL Islamic in compliance with the requirements of the Shari'ah and the SBP. The allocation (of income and expenses to different pools) is based on pre-defined basis and accounting principles / standards. The direct expenses are charged to respective pool.

## Chunk 844

# 6.26 Lease liability and right-of-use assets

At the inception of the contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

At the commencement date of the lease, the Holding Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The Holding Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. After the commencement date, the Bank reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control that affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. The Holding Company cannot readily determine the profit rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental fund acceptance rate to measure lease liabilities.

# 6.27 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity and recognised at their face value. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

# 13.2.2

This represents an intangible asset (customer relationship) which comprises of core deposits which were recognised at the time of acquisition of ex-RBS Pakistan. These core deposits represent the funding benefit that would be available to the Holding Company on account of availability of funding through deposit customers rather than from the wholesale or interbank market. This benefit also considers the fact that the economic life time of these deposits is longer than their contractual life. Based on this assumption, this intangible asset had been valued using certain valuation techniques and is being amortised over the life expectancy of these deposits. As more fully explained in note 13.3 to these consolidated financial statements, the SBP allowed the Holding Company to adjust the amortisation charge arising on this intangible asset against non-distributable capital reserve. The remaining amortisation period of this intangible asset is ranging from 5 to 6 years.

# 13.3

Non-distributable capital reserve - gain on bargain purchase

As per the directive of the SBP through its letter BPRD (R&P-02)/625-99/2011/3744 dated March 28, 2011, gain arising on bargain purchase of Pakistan operations of Royal Bank of Scotland (ex-RBS Pakistan) was credited directly into equity as non-distributable capital reserve (NCR). The SBP allowed the Group to adjust the amortisation of the intangible asset against the portion of reserve which arose on account of such asset. Accordingly, the Group has adjusted amortisation of intangible asset amounting to Rs 52.650 million (2023: Rs. 68.968 million) (net of tax) from the non-distributable capital reserve.

SBP through its circular BPRD/BRD/PIAHCL/733688–2024 dated August 01, 2024 has allowed staggering of such fair value impact over a period of 6 years at rates of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 25% from year 1 to year 6, accordingly, the Holding Company has amortized 5% in the current year.

14.5 The amount represents the prepaid employment benefit recognized in connection with concessional Islamic financing facilities provided to employees. These facilities were initially recognized at fair value due to the adoption of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan. The resultant benefit arising from these concessional facilities is subsequently accounted for under IAS 19 Employee Benefits. The prepaid employee benefit is amortized in a manner that reflects the concessional facilities' income recognition. The current year amortization of prepaid employee benefit asset amounts to Rs. 628.644 million.

# 38.1.11 Sensitivity analysis

The analysis based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the gratuity liability recognised within the statement of financial position. The increase / (decrease) in the present value of defined benefit obligations as a result of change in each assumption should be summarised as illustrated below:

| |2024|2023|
|---|---|---|
|1% increase in discount rate|(193,444)|(131,397)|
|1% decrease in discount rate|222,389|149,748|
|1% increase in expected rate of salary increase|224,308|152,716|
|1% decrease in expected rate of salary increase|(198,665)|(136,223)|

# 38.1.15 Maturity profile

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 8.11 years.

The policy followed by the Bank in respect of the staff retirement benefit schemes is disclosed in note 6.14 of these consolidated financial statements.

---

## Chunk 946

# 38.1.17 The gratuity scheme exposes the Bank to the following risks:

# Asset volatility

The Defined Benefit Gratuity Islamic Fund is invested in Ijarah Sukuk. The investment is almost 94.91% (Rs. 2,331 million) for Ijarah Sukuk. Islamic Fund has not such investment in any Government Bonds and Corporate Bonds hence the asset volatility risk is lower.

---

## Chunk 947

# Changes in bond yields

There are two dimensions to the changes in Bond yields: first, as described above; second, the valuation of the gratuity Liability is discounted with reference to these bond yields. So any increase in Bond yields will lower the gratuity Liability and vice versa, but, it will also lower the asset values.

---

## Chunk 948

# Inflation risk

The salary inflation is the major risk that the gratuity fund liability carries. In a general economic sense and in a longer view, there is a case that if bond yields increase, the change in salary inflation generally offsets the gains from the decrease in discounted gratuity liability. But viewed with the fact that asset values will also decrease, the salary inflation does, as an overall affect, increases the net liability of the Bank.

---

## Chunk 949

# Life expectancy / withdrawal rate

The Gratuity is paid off at the maximum of age 60. The Life expectancy is in almost minimal range and is quite predictable in the ages when the employee is in the accredited employment of the Bank for the purpose of the Gratuity. Thus, the risk of life expectancy is almost negligible. However, had a post-retirement benefit been given by the Bank like monthly pension, post-retirement medical etc., this would have been a significant risk which would have been quite difficult to value even by using advance mortality improvement models.

426 Faysal Bank
---

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

The withdrawal risk is dependent upon the: benefit structure; age and retention profile of the staff; the valuation methodology; and long-term valuation assumptions. In this case, it is not a significant risk.

---

## Chunk 950

# Other risks

Though, not imminent and observable, over long term there are some risks that may crystallize. This includes:

- Retention risk – The risk that employee will not be motivated to continue the service or start working with the Bank if no market comparable retirement benefit is provided.
- Final Salary Risk – The risk, for defined benefit gratuity, that any disproportionate salary merit increases in later service years will give rise to multiplicative increase in the gratuity liability as such increase is applicable to all the past years of service.
- Model Risk – The defined benefit gratuity liability is usually actuarially valued each year. Further, the assets in the Gratuity Fund are also marked to market. This two-tier valuation gives rise to the model risk.
- Operational Risk related to a separate entity - Retirement benefits are funded through a separate trust fund which is a different legal entity than the Bank. Generally, the protocols, processes and conventions used throughout the Bank are not applicable or are not actively applied to the retirement benefit Funds. This gives rise to some specific operational risks.
- Compliance Risk – The risk that retirement benefits offered by the Bank does not comply with minimum statutory requirements.
- Legal/Political Risk – The risk that the legal/political environment changes and the Bank is required to offer additional or different retirement benefits than what the Bank projected.

# DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS OF SUBSIDIARY

# Faysal Asset Management Limited

# DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN

The Company operates an approved funded defined benefit gratuity scheme for all its permanent employees. The gratuity fund is governed under the Trusts Act, 1882, Trust Deed and Rules of Fund, Companies Act, 2017, the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 and the Income Tax Rules, 2002. Responsibility for governance of plan, including investment decisions and contribution schedule lie with Board of Trustees of the Fund. The latest actuarial valuation of the fund was carried out at December 31, 2024.

The gratuity scheme exposes the entity to the following risks:

# Mortality risks

The risk that the actual mortality experience is different. The effect depends on the beneficiaries’ service / age, distribution and the benefit.

# Investment risks

The risk of the investment underperforming and not being sufficient to meet the liabilities. This is managed by formulating proper investment plan in consultation with investment advisors of the Fund.

# Risk of insufficiency of assets

This is managed by making regular contribution to the Fund as advised by the actuary.

# Final salary risks

The risk that the final salary at the time of cessation of service is higher than what was assumed. Since the benefit is calculated on the final salary, the benefit amount increases similarly.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

# 42 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified under held to collect model, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified under held to collect model are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available consolidated financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term financing, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

---

## Chunk 966

# 42.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

|On-balance sheet financial instruments|Level|Level|Level|Total| | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| |Level 1|Level 2|Level 3| | | |
|Financial assets - measured at fair value|-|610,499,249|-|610,499,249| | |

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Fair values of GoP Ijara Sukuk|are derived using the PKISRV rates announced by the Financial Markets Association of Pakistan (FMAP) through Reuters and GIS revaluation rates issued by PSX. These rates denote an average of quotes received from different pre-defined / approved dealers / brokers.|
|Ijarah Sukuk| |
|Unlisted ordinary shares|Break-up value is determined on the basis of the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the company using the latest available financial statements.|
|Sukuk Certificates|Fair values of Sukuk certificates are determined using the MUFAP or PSX rates.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
|Derivative instruments|The Holding Company enters into derivative contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations.|
|Mutual funds|Units of mutual funds are valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).|
|Property and equipment (land and buildings)|Land and buildings and NBA are revalued by professionally qualified valuers of the Holding Company. The valuations, mentioned above, are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Holding Company which are also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation experts use a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Holding Company’s properties. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties.|

# 47 RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk management group (RMG) has been organised under the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). It has been authorised by the Board of Directors (BoD) to monitor the implementation of an integrated risk management framework across the Holding Company. As an ongoing exercise to integrate risk related functions, RMG has been expanded, strengthened and entrusted to monitor the risk areas across the organisation, including adoption and convergence towards regulatory and Basel guidelines on risk management.

The primary objective of this architecture is to inculcate risk management into the organisation flows to ensure that risks are timely and accurately identified and assessed, properly documented, approved and adequately monitored and managed in order to ensure that risk taking activities are in line with the guidelines approved by the BoD and to protect the interests of the Bank’s depositors and shareholders.

The 'risk management framework' at the Group encompasses:

- scope of risks to be managed;
- process, systems and procedures to manage risk; and
- roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in risk management.

The Group has adopted an approach that gives an integrated view of the risks faced by the organisation. This calls for aligning strategic vision, policy objectives and business processes / procedures within the risk management framework.

The management of risk is integrated with the Group's management of capital and strategy. This ensures that risks taken in pursuit of the Group's strategic objectives are consistent with the policies, translating into targeted shareholder return as well as the Group's desired credit rating and risk appetite.

With this in view, the risk management framework endeavours to be a comprehensive and evolving set of guidelines to cater to changing business dynamics. The risk management framework includes:

- clearly defined risk management policies;
- well constituted organisational structure; and
- mechanism for ongoing review of all policies and procedures and risk exposures.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

The 'risk management framework' is built on the following elements:

- comprehensive risk governance; and
- effective risk processes.

The Group has developed and implemented a governance and management structure, processes surrounding each risk area, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, capital management, operational risk, environmental, social risk, shari'ah non-compliance and information security risk.

The essential components which contribute in effective management of all these risks are as follows:

- active board / senior management strategic direction and centralised RMG oversight;
- sufficient policies, procedures and limits;
- adequate risk measurement, monitoring and management information systems; and
- comprehensive internal controls.

The Board of Directors (BoD) monitoring and oversight is facilitated through the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC), comprising of directors including the President & CEO. It is appointed and authorised by the BoD to assist in the design, regular evaluation and timely updation of the risk management framework. The BRMC has further authorised management committees such as Country Credit Committee (CCC), Agriculture Credit Committee (ACC), Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC) and Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO) to supervise risk management activities within their respective areas.

In order to have an effective and efficient risk assessment, and to closely align its functions with business, RMG has separate risk management functions for credit risk management, based on the specialised skill sets and required specific experience in various business segments. These functions comprise of corporate risk, CBSME, agri and retail risk management.

The common responsibilities of all credit risk management functions include:

- conduct a thorough and an independent due diligence of the proposed / existing exposures in the respective risk portfolios.
- work with compliance department of the Holding Company to ensure conformity to the relevant Government regulations, the SBP PRs as well as internal policies.
- work with relationship teams to structure exposures such that they mitigate key risks, cater to customer requirements, remain economical in terms of risk weighted assets / capital allocation to ensure adequate risk coverage.

The risk management architecture is further fostered by enterprise risk management, Risk Policy, Analytics & ESG, information security function and an independent credit administration department.

The enterprise risk management function is responsible for managing and controlling market, operational and liquidity risks at an enterprise level and monitoring regulatory capital requirements of the Group.

Credit administration department - independent from the Risk Management function - looks after the security, financing documentation, disbursement and post disbursement monitoring aspects of the credit portfolio.

Risk Policy, analytics & ESG department serves as an independent check in the risk management function. It performs periodic review of all credit related portfolios (corporate, CBSME, retail, agri, SAM) and analyses portfolio compositions, risk rating distributions, emerging trends of NPLs, renewal status of Risk Approvals (RAs) as per policy and other policy related matters. It also formulates / updates credit policies (along with various limits prescribed therein) in line with regulatory environment, business strategy, the BoD approvals and the best practices.

# 47.1 Credit risk

Credit risk is the identification of probability that a counterparty will cause a financial loss to the Group due to its inability or unwillingness to meet its contractual obligation. This credit risk arises mainly from both direct financing activities as well as contingent liabilities.

The Group’s credit risk philosophy is based on the Group’s overall business strategy / direction as established by the Board. The Group is committed to the appropriate level of due diligence to ensure that credit risks have been properly analysed, fully disclosed to the approving authorities, appropriately rated, appropriately structured, appropriately priced and documented.

The Group deals with many different types of obligors/borrowers and financing structures across the corporate, commercial, SME, agriculture and retail segments. The Group manages customer credit risk exposures within appropriate limits to ensure that it does not provide a disproportionate level of credit to a single borrower or group of connected clients. The Group follows aggregation principles – summing of credit risk limits to the same borrower, or group of connected clients – to identify and manage effectively all significant credit risk exposures to a single borrower within an individual business and, where appropriate, across other business segments.

The Group has well-defined credit approval and review processes under which senior officers with the requisite credit background, critically scrutinise, advise and discuss associated risks and recommend / review / approve credit facilities and financing, through respective credit committees. Besides financial, industry and transaction analysis, in order to quantify risks of counterparty, the credit evaluation also includes risk rating system to evaluate risk rating of the customers which is then monitored on a portfolio basis to gauge the Group’s credit portfolio quality. To avoid risk concentration, counterparty limits, counterparty group limits and industry concentration limits are also established, monitored and assessed in the light of changing counterparty and market conditions.

With a view to develop and effectively manage a diversified credit portfolio within each business segment (as an integral part of the credit risk management process), the Group has adopted the concept of an industry / sector-wise exposure concentration grid which dictates target market exposures.

As part of the Group’s portfolio strategy and planning activity, these industry concentration limits are continually overseen by the management against the Group's approved exposures in these sectors and reviewed by the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) in its meetings with an aim to monitor the overall risk and to avoid high exposure to a single group or industry.

The Group is regularly conducting credit portfolio reviews to assess early warning signs, with robust post disbursement credit review mechanism to identify obligors/customers most likely to be affected in the challenging business and economic environment. The Group is confident that it has adequate capacity to withstand Challenges.

The Group uses the Standardised Approach to calculate capital charge for credit risk as per Basel regulatory framework, with comprehensive approach for credit risk mitigation.

Stress testing for credit risk is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of increase in non performing financing and downward shift in these categories.

# 47.1.1 Segment by class of business

Credit Risk Management (CRM) Framework (non-individual portfolio) covers three business segments: corporate risk management, commercial Grouping and SME (including agri) risk management. Based on overall guidance provided by a recognised and established external consultant, in line with the global best practices while ensuring regulatory compliance and alleviation of any (perceived) conflict of interest, credit management process has been segregated into two distinct categories:

- independent risk advice by risk management function.
- credit approvals by credit committee(s), while taking into consideration the business unit recommendations / approvals and independent risk advice.

With this segregation, the role of risk management function in credit approval process is focused to provide risk advice only, based on key risk parameters; whereas relevant credit committees are responsible for providing credit related approvals.

The common responsibilities of corporate risk management and commercial banking and SME (including agri) risk management include:

- conduct a thorough and an independent due diligence of the proposed / existing exposures in the respective risk portfolios.
- work with relationship teams to advise on structure of exposures such that they mitigate key risks, cater to borrower requirements, remain economical in terms of risk weighted assets / capital allocation to ensure risk coverage.
- work with the independent credit risk review team (under internal audit) for effective and periodic review of the credit portfolio.

Retail risk management is responsible for managing the credit risk of consumer finance credit products, with credit facilities extended to individual (non-corporate) borrower. The consumer finance function operates on a program approach, which are approved by the Country Credit Committee and subsequently by the BoD. The retail risk management provides its input on risk parameters in term of 'risk advice', at the time of approval / changes in product programs. The retail risk management also ensures that all the ongoing individual credit approvals are within pre-defined risk parameters as per the approved product programs.

# 47.1.2 Credit risk: general disclosures Basel specific

The Group has adopted the standardised approach under Basel. According to the regulatory statement submitted under the standardised approach, the portfolio has been divided into claims on public sector entities in Pakistan (PSEs), claims on corporate (excluding equity exposure) and claims categorised as retail portfolio. Claims on corporate constitute 62.04% (2023: 59.83%) of the total credit risk weighted assets, 2.33% (2023: 1.27%) represents claims on PSEs and 15.04% (2023: 13.99%) exposure pertains to claims categorised as retail portfolio.

## Chunk 990

# 47.1.3 Credit risk: disclosures for portfolio subject to standardised approach

For domestic claims, external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs) recommended by the SBP, namely Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) and VIS Credit Rating Company Limited are used. For claims on foreign entities, ratings assigned by Standard and Poor, Fitch and Moody's are used. Exposures not rated by any of the aforementioned rating agencies are categorised as unrated.

# 47.1.9 Forward-looking information contained in ECL

The Holding Company's Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculation incorporates forward-looking information by integrating macroeconomic variables to enhance the accuracy and reliability of credit risk estimates. The use of forward-looking data helps in better predicting potential credit losses under different economic conditions.

To estimate Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD), the Holding Company utilizes historical and forecasted macroeconomic data. For ECL calculations, the Holding Company considers Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) as the primary macroeconomic variables, with forecasted data sourced from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The selection of these variables is based on their relevance and sensitivity to specific portfolios.

The Holding Company has developed three macroeconomic scenarios—Base, Best, and Worst—to reflect potential economic conditions. These scenarios have been assigned probability weightings of 60% for the Base scenario, 10% for the Best scenario, and 30% for the Worst scenario to ensure a comprehensive assessment of credit risk exposure.

As part of its forward-looking assessment, the Holding Company conducted a sensitivity analysis on macroeconomic indicators used in Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculations. As of December 31, 2024, the Holding Company developed three scenarios—Base, Best, and Worst—based on a five-year forecast. A 10% change in macroeconomic variables (GDP and CPI) in the Base scenario was applied to assess the upside and downside impact on PD / ECL. The resulting variations across different segments are as follows:

|Segment|Upwards|Downwards|
|---|---|---|
|Corporate/Commercial|-9.080%|10.293%|
|SME|-9.404%|10.344%|
|AGRI|-7.223%|7.699%|
|Consumer|-3.697%|3.838%|

# 47.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk / currency risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in currency exchange rates. It refers to the impact of adverse movements in currency exchange rates on the value of open foreign currency positions. Changes in currency rates affect the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and may affect revenues from foreign exchange dealing.

The Group undertakes currency risk mostly to support its trade services and maintains overall foreign exchange risk position to the extent of statutory Foreign Exchange Exposure Limit (FEEL) prescribed by the SBP. Exposure limits such as counterparty, gap, net open position, dealer and bucket-wise currency delta limits are in place in accordance with the Bank’s approved policies in order to manage associated risk and concentration at the acceptable tolerance levels.

# 47.2.3 Equity Position Risk

Equity position risk is the risk arising from unfavourable fluctuations in prices of shares in which the Group carries positions. It is a risk to earnings or capital that results from adverse changes in the value of equity related portfolios of the Group. Price risk associated with equities could be systematic or unsystematic. Systematic risk is due to sensitivity of portfolio’s value to changes in overall level of equity prices, while unsystematic risk is associated with price volatility that is determined by the specific characteristics of the investee company.

The Group's equity position is governed by position limits imposed by the SBP for overall investment and per scrip exposure. Additionally, there are internal limits set to manage overall earnings in the form of stop loss limits and maintain a diverse portfolio through sector concentration limits.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

Yield curve risk is the risk that a financial instrument will suffer either a decline in income or capital because future changes in prevailing profit rates impact assets more or less than they impact liabilities.

The profit rate risk of the Group arises when there is a mismatch between contractual maturities, which are subject to profit rate adjustment within a specified period or re-pricing of on and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities. Risk is addressed by Asset and Liability Management Committee that reviews the profit rate dynamics at regular intervals and decides re-pricing of assets and liabilities to ensure that the spread of the Group remains at an acceptable level.

Major sources of profit rate risk are;

1. differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (re-pricing risk);
2. changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting the Group's activities (basis risk);
3. changing rate relationships across the range of maturities (yield curve risk);
4. profit-related options embedded in the Group's products (options risk); and
5. changes in marked-to-market value of financial instruments which occur when profit changes (price risk).

# 47.3 Operational risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors or from external events. The Group businesses are dependent on the ability to process a large number of transactions efficiently and accurately. Operational risks and losses originate from business / operational process failure, IT security failure, natural disasters, dependence on key suppliers, fraud, service quality compromises, regulatory non-compliance, loss of key staff and social and environmental impacts.

The operational risk management function is primarily responsible for the oversight of operational risk management across the Group. The operational risk management framework of the Group is governed by the operational risk management policy and procedures, while the implementation is supported by an operational risk management system and designated operational risk coordinators within different units across the Group. The framework is in line with international best practices, flexible enough to implement in stages and permits the overall approach to evolve in response to organizational learning and future requirements.

The Group has implemented an effective operational risk management framework for managing operational risk. Each department has processes and system controls in place to address operational risks within their area. Operational loss data is collected through a well defined program implemented across the Group. Periodic workshops are conducted for risk and control self assessment and key risk exposures are identified and assessed against existing controls to evaluate improvement opportunities. Key risk indicators are also defined for monitoring of risk exposures. New products, systems, activities and processes are subject to comprehensive operational risk assessments, before implementation. Regular updates on operational risk status is presented to Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC) and the Board of Directors through the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC). Further, as part of Group’s ongoing commitment to enhance Group’s services and to ensure Group-wide risk awareness culture, Operational Risk Management Department has also organized special workshops / classroom trainings tailored for Pan Pakistan Branch Operations Team.

# Operational risk-disclosures Basel II specific

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.

The Group is currently using basic indicator approach for calculating operational risk capital charge.

Under basic indicator approach the capital charge for operational risk is a fixed percentage (denoted alpha) of average positive annual gross income of the Group over the past three years. Figures for any year in which annual gross income is negative or zero, should be excluded from both the numerator and denominator when calculating the average.

# 47.4 Shari'ah Non-Compliance Risk (SNCR)

Shari'ah Non-Compliance Risk (SNCR) is the financial and reputational risk that arises from a Group’s failure to comply with the Shari'ah rules and principles prescribed by the State Bank of Pakistan and Shari'ah Board of the Group.

Managing Shari'ah non-compliance risk is vital for the establishment of an effective Shari'ah governance system. Shari'ah compliance is critical to an Islamic Group's operations and such compliance requirements must permeate.

# 47.5 Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its payment obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they fall due and to replenish funds when they are withdrawn. Liquidity risk management framework is governed by the liquidity risk management policy. The policy provides specific directives for measuring and managing liquidity risk, identifies responsible personnel, and defines their respective roles and responsibilities relating to liquidity risk management.

The management of liquidity risk is accomplished through a formal structure which includes:

- Board of Directors (BoD)
- Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC)
- Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO)
- Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC)
- Treasury
- Risk management (enterprise risk management)
- Finance

The BoD approves the liquidity risk management policy including risk limits and ensures, through quarterly reviews by the BRMC, that the Group's liquidity risk is being managed prudently. The BRMC plays a strategic role in liquidity risk management by overseeing the liquidity risk profile of the Group. ERMC defines the risk tolerance levels and sets risk limits for effective liquidity risk management. ALCO ensures adherence with policy requirements and risk limits so that the Group remains sufficiently liquid at all times.

The market and liquidity risk under enterprise risk management function oversees liquidity risk. The Group’s Asset and Liability Committee manages the liquidity position on a continuous basis. The Group ensures to maintain a diversified portfolio of liquid assets and funding base. Sources of funding comprise of a good mix of core deposits. Concentration in deposit, especially large volume deposits, is closely monitored to anticipate any potential liquidity issues in case of their withdrawals.

Various tools and techniques are used to measure and monitor the possible liquidity risk. These include monitoring of different liquidity ratios like liquid assets to liquid liabilities, liquid assets to total deposits, large volume deposits to total deposits, financing to deposit, liquid assets to volatile funding; on a regular basis against defined limits. Further, liquidity gaps over different time bands are also monitored through maturity profiling of assets and liabilities. The Group also ensures that statutory cash and liquidity requirements are maintained at all times. In addition, the Group has also implemented the SBP's Basel III liquidity standards for ensuring compliance with the requirements of LCR, NSFR and other monitoring tools.

The Group performs liquidity stress testing on a periodic basis in order to ensure sufficient liquidity is always available to meet financial obligations / commitments. Stress testing aims to quantify the potential impact of extreme yet plausible events or movements on the value of the portfolio. Shocks include withdrawal of deposits, withdrawal of wholesale / large deposits, withdrawal of top deposits, etc. The results of liquidity stress testing are shared with relevant authorities / committees on a periodic basis.

Contingency funding plan (CFP) is a part of the liquidity risk management policy of the Group. CFP provides a set of several early warning indicators of a possible liquidity shortfall situation; describes the actions to be taken to manage it and identifies the roles and responsibilities of ALCO, CFP team or other relevant authorities.
