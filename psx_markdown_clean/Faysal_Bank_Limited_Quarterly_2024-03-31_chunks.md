## Chunk 7

# Economic Update

As we navigate through the fiscal year 2024, the 3QFY24 has shown a resilient economic recovery marked by positive developments in economic and financial conditions. Despite a tough fiscal year, each passing month has shown signs of improving overall economic confidence.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March clocked in at 20.68%, finally entering the positive real interest rate territory both currently and on forward-looking basis. Despite the impact of increased global oil prices leading to a rise in domestic fuel prices and frequent adjustments in gas and power tariffs in line with IMF directives, inflation remains subdued. This reduction in inflation is partly attributable to the high base effect from the previous year.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) opted to maintain the policy rate at 22% during its latest Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting on March 18, 2024, adopting a cautious stance in response to uncertainty regarding the inflation outlook.

Government’s fiscal performance has managed to surpass targets with a 33% year-on-year increase in its tax collection up to Rs. 879 billion in March 2024. In the 9 months of FY24, FBR has managed to collect PKR 6.7 trillion, a 30% increase compared to the previous year.

However, the fiscal deficit during Jul-Jan FY2024, increased to 2.6% of GDP, up from 2.3% recorded last year. The government remains committed to prudent fiscal management by

# Profit & Loss Account

|Rs. in million|March ‘24|March ‘23|Growth %|
|---|---|---|---|
|Total Revenue|23,349|15,556|50.1|
|Operating and other Expenses|10,839|7,954|36.3|
|Profit before tax and provisions|12,510|7,602|64.6|
|Net provisions|32|1,364|(97.7)|
|Profit before tax|12,478|6,238|100.0|
|Tax|5,965|3,027|97.1|
|Profit after tax|6,513|3,211|102.8|
|Earnings per share (Rupees)|4.29|2.12|102.8|

In Q1‘24, FBL continued its trajectory of success and has achieved remarkable financial performance and recorded unprecedented growth despite challenges posed by the prevailing economic conditions. On a standalone basis, Profit Before Tax (PBT) increased by 100.0% to PKR 12.5 billion. FBL has achieved a Profit After Tax (PAT) of PKR 6.5 billion, double than PKR 3.2 billion in the corresponding quarter last year, with Earnings Per Share increasing from PKR 2.12 to PKR 4.29.

The Bank with continuing its growth trajectory, has increased total revenue by 50.1% over Q1’23 to PKR 23.3 billion. This growth was driven by balance sheet expansion (Q1’24 vs Q1’23) and an uptick in spreads, resulting in a 43.3% YoY increase in net spread earned taking it to PKR 18.7 billion in Q1’24. Healthy growth in current deposits of PKR 55 billion (18.1%) YoY and increase in the average benchmark rate helped improve the overall spreads. Non-fund income grew by 85.4% over the corresponding quarter last year and is at PKR 4.7 billion in Q1’24. Fee income also experienced uptick of 32.9%, reaching PKR 2.6 billion, with significant contributions from trade and remittance business solidifying the Bank’s foothold in these key businesses. Compared with the corresponding quarter of last year trade volumes registered an exponential 155% increased while remittance volumes increased by 67%.

Due to double digit inflation, a volatile PKR relative to the USD, and an expanding branch network, the bank's total expenses have risen by 36.3% over Q1'23. However, the cost to income ratio has improved from 51.1% in Q1’23 to 46.42% in Q1’24. The net provision for Q1’24 was PKR 32 million, compared to a charge of PKR 1.4 billion in Q1’23. The NPL ratio is at 3.8% with total coverage at 114.3%.

FBL’s total assets continued to grow, reaching PKR 1.5 trillion, driven by strong deposit mobilization and increase due to borrowings from financial institutions. The upward trend in Current Accounts seen over past few years continued taking them to PKR 360 billion i.e., 10.3% growth over December 2023. Total deposits also increased by 3.1% over December 2023 and is at PKR 1 trillion. The deposits market share is maintained at 3.7% in March 2024. Current Account (CA) mix improved to 34.3% from 32.1% in December 2023 and CASA mix improved to 78.4% from 75.0% in December 2023.

6 First Quarter March 31, 2024
---
FBL’s net financing marginally reduced due to the impact of IFRS9 implementation and stands at PKR 576 billion. However, gross financing increased by PKR 2 billion. Advance Deposit Ratio (ADR) slightly reduced from 57.0% in December 2023 to 54.9% in March 2024. The liquidity generated was placed in investments. Investments increased by 9.7% and reached PKR 647 billion.

The Bank remained committed in achieving the given targets and creating sustainable value for stakeholders. With a strong foundation and a strategic focus on growth, we are confident in our ability to In Sha Allah, scale new heights in future.

---

## Chunk 34

# Notes to and forming part of the Condensed Interim Unconsolidated Financial Statements (un-audited)

# For the quarter ended March 31, 2024

# 4.1 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

During the period, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9: ‘Financial Instruments' became applicable to the Bank. IFRS 9 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘expected credit losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 from January 1, 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the standard.

IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of the accounting for financial liabilities:

---

## Chunk 35

# Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss regardless of the business model in which they are held.

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method.

---

## Chunk 36

# Equity Securities

Quoted equity shares amounting to Rs. 3,049.251 million have been classified as FVTPL. Gains and losses on disposal of securities classified as FVTPL will be recycled through the profit and loss account.

The Bank has elected to designate equity shares of Rs. 3,929.093 million as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) as permitted under IFRS 9. These securities were previously classified as available-for-sale (AFS). The changes in fair value of such securities will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss when they are disposed off.

Unquoted equity shares are also required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9. The fair value of these securities are determined as per adjusted net asset method valuation as these securities are neither listed nor market prices are available. Fair value gains or losses has been recognized directly in equity through OCI.

---

## Chunk 37

# Debt securities and Islamic financing and related assets

Debt securities currently classified as AFS and passing the SPPI test are measured at FVOCI under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold these assets to collect contractual cash flows and sell the investments. Debt securities currently classified as held-to-maturity (HTM) and passing the SPPI test are measured at amortized cost under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold these assets to collect contractual cash flows.

Debt securities that do not pass the SPPI test measured at FVTPL.

---

## Chunk 38

# Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain financing commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (‘12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’).

## Chunk 39

# Notes to and forming part of the Condensed Interim Unconsolidated Financial Statements (un-audited)

# For the quarter ended March 31, 2024

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognized are in ‘Stage 1'; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘Stage 2'; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘Stage 3'. Under the SBP’s instructions, the Bank is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency.

Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 and SBP's IFRS 9 application instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12-month ECL, Stage1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2).
- EAD: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortization, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.
- LGD: An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

## Chunk 40

# Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) through its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 9, 2023 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023 has amended the format of quarterly and half yearly financial statements of banks. All banks are directed to prepare their quarterly and half yearly financial statements on the revised format effective from accounting year starting from January 1, 2024. Accordingly, the Bank has prepared these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements on the new format prescribed by the SBP.

The adoption of revised format has resulted in following significant changes:

- Right-of-use-assets (note 15) amounting to Rs 10,500.360 million (December 31, 2023: Rs 10,713.046 million) which were previously shown as part of fixed assets are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.
- Lease liabilities (note 21) amounting to Rs 12,825.722 million (December 31, 2023: Rs 12,868.103 million) which were previously shown as part of other liabilities (note 23) are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.

|25.3.1|Income tax assessments of the Bank have been finalised upto the tax year 2023 (accounting year ended December 31, 2022). Income tax return for tax year 2024 (accounting year ended December 31, 2023) will be filed by the Bank within stipulated timeline.| |
| |The department and the Bank has disagreement on a matter relating to taxability of gain on bargain purchase on the acquisition of ex-RBS Pakistan. The additional tax liability on the matter amounts to Rs. 1,154.701 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 1,154.701 million). The Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] had deleted the said additional tax liability, however the income tax department had filed an appeal with the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) against the order of CIR(A). During the current period, the ATIR passed an order and maintained the decision of the CIR(A) in favour of the Bank that gain on bargain purchase is not taxable. Subsequently, the department has challenged the order in Honorable High Court of Sindh. However, the management of the Bank is confident that the matter will be decided in the Bank's favour and accordingly, no provision has been recorded in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements in respect of this matter.| |
|25.4|There are certain claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debt amounting to Rs 33,605.629 million (December 31, 2023: Rs 29,647.217 million). These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security), cases where the Bank was proforma defendant for defending its interest in the underlying collateral kept by it at the time of financing, certain cases filed by ex-employees of the Bank for damages sustained by them consequent to the termination from the Bank's employment and cases for damages towards opportunity losses suffered by the customers due to non-disbursements of running finance facility as per the agreed terms. The above also includes an amount of Rs 25,299.030 million (December 31, 2023: 25,299.030 million) in respect of a suit filed against the Bank for declaration, recovery of monies, release of securities, rendition of account and damages.| |
| |Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, the management is confident that the above matters will be decided in the Bank's favour and accordingly no provision has been made in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.| |
|25.5|Commitments to extend credits| |
| |The Bank makes commitments to extend credit (including to related parties) in the normal course of its business but these being revocable commitments do not attract any significant penalty or expense if the facilities are unilaterally withdrawn except for Rs. 4,008.151 million (December 2023: Rs. 3,429.739 million) which are irrevocable in nature.| |

# 37 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified under held to collect model, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified under held to collect model are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of adjusted net asset method as per their latest available financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

---

## Chunk 82

# 37.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Ijara Sukuk|Fair values of GoP Ijara Sukuk are derived using the PKISRV rates announced by the Financial Market Association (FMA) through Reuters. These rates denote an average of quotes received from different pre-defined / approved dealers / brokers.|
|Unlisted ordinary shares|The fair value of unquoted equity securities is determined on the basis of adjusted net asset method as per their latest available financial statements.|
|Sukuk Certificates|Fair values of Sukuk certificates are determined using the MUFAP or PSX rates.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan. The Bank enters into derivative contracts with various counterparties.|
|Derivative instruments|Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations.|
|Mutual funds|Units of mutual funds are valued using the net asset value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).|

|Non-banking assets (NBAs) acquired in satisfaction of claims|NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023.|

The valuations, mentioned above, are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation experts use a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank’s properties. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.

# 3 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Bank and the financial statements of the Subsidiary Company from the date from which control of the Subsidiary Company by the Group commences until the date on which control ceases. The financial statements of the Subsidiary Company are incorporated on a line-by-line basis and the investment held by the Bank is eliminated against the corresponding share capital and pre-acquisition reserve of the Subsidiary Company in the consolidated financial statements.

The financial statements of the Subsidiary Company are prepared for the same reporting period as the Holding Company, using accounting policies that are generally consistent with those of the Holding Company. Material intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated.

Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control established by contractual agreement. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

## Chunk 127

# 5.1 Impact of IFRS 9: 'Financial Instruments'

During the period, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9: ‘Financial Instruments' became applicable to the Bank. IFRS 9 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘expected credit losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Group which are exposed to credit risk. The Group has adopted IFRS 9 from January 1, 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the standard.

# Notes to and forming part of the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (un-audited)

# For the quarter ended March 31, 2024

IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of the accounting for financial liabilities:

---

## Chunk 128

# Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss regardless of the business model in which they are held.

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method.

---

## Chunk 129

# Equity Securities

Quoted equity shares amounting to Rs. 3,049.251 million have been classified as FVTPL. Gains and losses on disposal of securities classified as FVTPL will be recycled through the profit and loss account.

The Holding Company has elected to designate equity shares of Rs. 3,929.093 million as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) as permitted under IFRS 9. These securities were previously classified as available-for-sale (AFS). The changes in fair value of such securities will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss when they are disposed off.

Unquoted equity shares are also required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9. The fair value of these securities are determined as per adjusted net asset method valuation as these securities are neither listed nor market prices are available. Fair value gains or losses has been recognized directly in equity through OCI.

---

## Chunk 130

# Debt securities and Islamic financing and related assets

Debt securities currently classified as AFS and passing the SPPI test are measured at FVOCI under IFRS 9 as the Group’s business model is to hold these assets to collect contractual cash flows and sell the investments.

Debt securities currently classified as held-to-maturity (HTM) and passing the SPPI test are measured at amortized cost under IFRS 9 as the Group’s business model is to hold these assets to collect contractual cash flows.

Debt securities that do not pass the SPPI test are measured at FVTPL.

---

## Chunk 131

# Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain financing commitments and financial guarantee contracts.

At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (‘12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’).

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognized are in ‘Stage 1'; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘Stage 2'; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘Stage 3'. Under the SBP’s instructions, the Group is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency.

Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 and SBP's IFRS 9 application instructions, the Group has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12-month ECL, Stage1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2).
- EAD: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortization, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.

## Chunk 132

# Notes to and forming part of the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (un-audited)

# For the quarter ended March 31, 2024

LGD: An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Group expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

---

## Chunk 133

# Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Group used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

# 5.2 Revised format of condensed interim financial statements

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) through its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 9, 2023 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023 has amended the format of quarterly and half yearly financial statements of banks. All banks are directed to prepare their quarterly and half yearly financial statements on the revised format effective from accounting year starting from January 1, 2024. Accordingly, the Group has prepared these condensed interim consolidated financial statements on the new format prescribed by the SBP.

The adoption of revised format has resulted in following significant changes:

- Right-of-use-assets (note 16) amounting to Rs 10,550.392 million (December 31, 2023: Rs 10,771.515 million) which were previously shown as part of fixed assets are now shown separately on the consolidated statement of financial position.
- Lease liabilities (note 22) amounting to Rs 12,870.818 million (December 31, 2023: Rs 12,865.125 million) which were previously shown as part of other liabilities (note 24) are now shown separately on the consolidated statement of financial position.

|Total|4,122,244|4,122,244|

(i) Income tax assessments of the Holding Company have been finalised upto the tax year 2023 (accounting year ended December 31, 2022). Income tax return for tax year 2024 (accounting year ended December 31, 2023) will be filed by the Holding Company within stipulated timeline. The department and the Holding Company has disagreement on a matter relating to taxability of gain on bargain purchase on the acquisition of ex-RBS Pakistan. The additional tax liability on the matter amounts to Rs. 1,154.701 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 1,154.701 million). The Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] had deleted the said additional tax liability, however the income tax department had filed an appeal with the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) against the order of CIR(A). During the current period, the ATIR passed an order and maintained the decision of the CIR(A) in favour of the Holding Company that gain on bargain purchase is not taxable. Subsequently, the department has challenged the order in Honorable High Court of Sindh. However, the management of the Holding Company is confident that the matter will be decided in the Holding Company's favour and accordingly, no provision has been recorded in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this matter.

(ii) There are certain claims against the Holding Company not acknowledged as debt amounting to Rs 33,605.629 million (December 31, 2023: Rs 29,647.217 million).

# 26.3.2 Subsidiary Company - Faysal Asset Management Limited

(i) The income tax returns of the Subsidiary Company for the tax years 2004 to 2020 (financial year ended June 30, 2004 to December 31, 2019) have been filed and are deemed to have been assessed under the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, unless selected by the taxation authorities for audit purposes. The Tax year 2005 (financial year ended June 30, 2005) has been selected by the taxation authorities for audit purpose. The tax authorities have passed an order under section 221 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, whereby they have determined an additional liability of Rs. 0.913 million for the tax year 2005 on account of apportionment of expenses and disallowance of certain expenses. The Subsidiary Company has paid Rs. 0.414 million and has filed an appeal against the order before the Commissioner Appeals, the proceedings of which are underway. The remaining tax liability on these matters is Rs. 0.498 million. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(ii) The income tax department has issued orders and show cause notices under section 221 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for recovery of Workers Welfare Fund (WWF) aggregating to Rs 0.818 million in respect of tax years 2008 and 2013. The details of orders and show cause along with the management actions are listed below:

|Tax years|Order / show cause references|Status|WWF Demand Rupees '000|
|---|---|---|---|
|2008|Order u/s 221 dated June 30, 2014|Appeal pending before the Commissioner Appeals|315|
|2013|Show cause u/s 221 dated May 7, 2014|Showcause notice has been responded to|503|
|Total|Total|Total|818|

The management is of the view that WWF was not applicable for tax year 2008. In tax year 2013, subsequent to clarification decision by the SHC, the management has not admitted WWF charge in the annual return of income. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(iii) The Punjab Revenue Authority issued show cause notice No.PRA/AM/61/2205/ dated March 12, 2014 to Faysal Asset Management Limited requiring the Subsidiary Company to obtain registration / enrolment and to pay sales tax amounting to Rs. 6.055 million from July 2013 to March 2014 under the Punjab Sales Tax on Services Act, 2012 with effect from May 22, 2013 on management fee earned in Punjab. In respect of this, the Subsidiary Company, jointly with other Asset Management Companies together with their respective collective investment schemes through their trustees, has filed a petition on July 8, 2014 in the SHC challenging the above notice. The Court has ordered suspension of the show cause notice till the next hearing of appeal in their order dated July 10, 2014. The next date of hearing has not yet been decided. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(iv) During the prior period, the audit of the tax year 2013 (financial year ended June 30, 2013) was completed by the taxation authorities. The tax authorities have passed an order under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, whereby they have determined an additional liability of Rs. 4.964 million for the tax year 2013 on account of apportionment of expenses, salary expenses and hardware and software expense. The management filed an appeal before the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] on the grounds of disallowances made by the Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue. The CIR(A) remanded back a few expenses while ordered against various other expenses for which the Subsidiary Company has decided to appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland.

The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(v) During the year ended December 31, 2020, the audit of the tax year 2014 (financial year ended June 30, 2014) was completed by the taxation authorities. The tax authorities have passed an order under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, whereby they have determined an additional liability of Rs. 2.673 million for the tax year 2014 on account of apportionment of expenses, time barred payables, expenses claimed on provisional basis, salary expenses, marketing and advertising expenses, brokerage and commission expenses, legal and professional charges and hardware and software expenses. The management had decided to file an appeal before the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] on the grounds of disallowances made by the Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue. During the current period the CIR(A) issued an order whereby the earlier order passed by the tax authorities under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, has been annulled on the basis of being time barred, and consequentially the demand for additional liability has been relinquished. The management has decided to file an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) to contest the order passed by DCIR. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(vi) During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Deputy Commissioner Inland Revenue (DCIR) has passed an order under section 182(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for the tax year 2018, whereby the DCIR has imposed a penalty of Rs. 0.833 million on account of non submission of statement required to be filed by the Subsidiary Company under bilateral or multilateral convention under section 165B of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. The management has filed an appeal before the CIR(A) on the subject matter and has paid an amount of Rs 0.083 million being 10% of the total amount of penalty imposed under the order and has thus obtained an automatic stay on the subject matter. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the matter will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision in respect of this penalty has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

| |The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified under held to collect model, is based on quoted market price.

The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of adjusted net asset method as per their latest available financial statements.| | | | |
| |The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.| | | | |
|38.1|Fair value of financial assets| | | | |
| |The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:| | | | |
| |Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.| | | | |

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Ijara Sukuk|Fair values of GoP Ijara Sukuk are derived using the PKISRV rates announced by the Financial Market Association (FMA) through Reuters. These rates denote an average of quotes received from different pre-defined / approved dealers / brokers.|
|Unlisted ordinary shares|The fair value of unquoted equity securities is determined on the basis of adjusted net asset method as per their latest available financial statements.|
|Sukuk Certificates|Fair values of Sukuk certificates are determined using the MUFAP or PSX rates.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
|Derivative instruments|The Bank enters into derivative contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations.|
|Mutual funds|Units of mutual funds are valued using the net asset value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).|

## Chunk 177

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 3

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Property and equipment (land and buildings)|Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2022.|
|Non-banking assets (NBAs) acquired in satisfaction of claims|NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023.|

The valuations, mentioned above, are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Holding Company which are also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation experts use a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Holding Company’s properties. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.
