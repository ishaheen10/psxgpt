During the year under review, Pakistan economy witnessed recovery with key macroeconomic indicators moving in the right direction, inflation and interest rates going down, current account balance achieved surplus in later part of the year, GDP rebounded to 2.5% in FY24. While the economic indicators are promising, it is imperative to address structural challenges in key sectors operating in the country.

The total assets remained above Rs. 1.5 trillion, gross advances increased to Rs. 503.8 billion at year-end with 14.9% growth. Investments and deposits closed at Rs. 810.9 billion and Rs. 927.1 billion at year end respectively.

At year-end, HabibMetro's equity stands at Rs. 115.0 billion, with a capital adequacy level of 19.3% against the required 11.5%.

The primary role of the Board is to set the overall strategy for the Bank and enhance its long-term strategic value. The Board's focus remains the overall governance structure to ensure effective oversight of the business, establishing a risk & control framework.

Determining Bank's level of risk tolerance through different policies and documents relating to operational, regulatory, compliance; and financial performance of the Bank.

The composition of the Board has been established to ensure the availability of resources with relevant knowledge and experience to manage the strategic objectives of the Bank. It comprises of three independent directors including one female director and five non-executive directors.

In the course of discharging its responsibilities, the Board acts in good faith, with due diligence and care, and in the best interests of the Bank and its Shareholders.

An internal board performance evaluation process is in place to enhance the overall effectiveness of the Board, its sub-committees and individual directors including the Chief Executive Officer. The evaluation is based on questionnaire on Board effectiveness which includes areas covering various aspects like Board composition, its responsibilities & duties, strategic plan & performance review, quality of information received & its timeliness, among others.

This review forms an integral part of the Directors' Report to the Shareholders.

I would like to take this opportunity to place on record my sincere gratitude to the Ministry of Finance, the State Bank of Pakistan and the Securities and the Exchange Commission of Pakistan for their continued support and guidance. I also acknowledge our valued customers for their trust and staff members for their devotion and diligence.

We bow our heads to Allah and pray for His blessings and continued guidance.

# DIRECTORS’ REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS

Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the audited annual financial statements of Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited (HABIBMETRO) for the financial year ended 31 December, 2024.

## Chunk 3

# ECONOMIC AND BANKING REVIEW

During the period under review, Pakistan's economic and financial trajectory has remained positively aligned with recovery, owing to the resumption of funding from multilateral and bilateral partners alongside remedial policy measures including swift implementation of austerity measures suggested by International Monetary Fund (IMF). The country witnessed a sharp decline in inflation throughout the year, resulting in cooling off of interest rates from second half of the year, contributing to the consolidation of fiscal accounts. However, economic growth is projected to be modest, primarily due to subdued agricultural sector performance.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has undertaken a significant monetary adjustment, reducing the policy rate by 900 basis points from 22.0 percent to 13.0 percent during 2024 and further reducing to 12.0 percent in January 2025, while inflation declined from 23.9 percent in FY24 to 6.6 percent in 7 months of current fiscal year, reaching to 2.4 percent year on year in January 2025 supported by easing global prices, a stable exchange rate, and targeted government policies amidst favorable base effect.

Driven by strong workers' remittances and export earnings, the current account posted surplus in last three months of 2024 resulting in USD 0.7 billion cumulative surplus in 7M-FY25 against USD 1.8 billion deficit in same period last year. Exports grew by 7.3 percent to USD 23.9 billion during 7M-FY25 against 7M-FY24, while imports grew to USD 40.0 billion by 10.6 percent. This deficit is partly offset by significant growth of 31.7 percent growth in workers' remittances to USD 20.8 billion in the 7M-FY25. For FY25, the SBP expects the current account to remain in the range between a surplus and a deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP.

Augmenting by 8.8 percent on a year-on-year basis, the banking sector's deposit base amounted to Rs. 30.3 trillion at the end of December 2024. Advances grew by 29.6 percent year-on-year and stood at Rs. 16.0 trillion. Investments during the period also increased by 15.2 percent year-on-year to be recorded at Rs. 29.1 trillion.

The economic recovery achieved in FY24, with GDP growth rate of 2.5 percent against a contraction of 0.2 percent in FY23, has sustained positive growth of 0.9 percent in the first quarter of FY25. However, growth has slowed compared to the 2.3 percent recorded last year, reflecting moderation across key sectors, particularly in agriculture. The slower growth in agriculture is primarily due to the high base effect in the crop sector of the last fiscal year and the decline in the crop production of cotton, rice, sugarcane, and maize. However, the textile sector, wholesale, retail trade are gradually accelerating and impacting other related sectors positively.

These developments reflect the central bank's proactive approach in stabilizing the macroeconomic environment and fostering conditions conducive to sustainable growth. The significant reduction in policy rates not only lowers borrowing costs for businesses and consumers but also encourages investment and consumption activities. However, while the monetary indicators show promise, it remains crucial to address underlying structural challenges particularly in the agricultural sector to bolster overall economic performance and ensure that the benefits of these policy measures are fully realized across all segments of the economy.

# CREDIT RISK

HABIBMETRO observes a strategy to control credit risk through product, geography, industry and customer diversification. The Bank extends trade and working capital financing, keeping the major portion of its exposure on a short-term and self-liquidating basis.

The risk inherent in extending credit is further mitigated by rigorous and robust credit approval procedures, which have been structured to ensure proper evaluation, adequacy of security, and monitoring of exposures on an ongoing basis. All these risk-mitigation measures are further facilitated by centralized trade processing and credit administration.

HABIBMETRO has implemented the IFRS-9 standards. IFRS 9 replaces the existing guidelines of the IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

# FUTURE OUTLOOK

Pakistan's economy shows promising growth despite global challenges like trade recovery and geopolitical uncertainties. With inflation down, policy rates easing, and stable commodity prices, the environment is favorable for investment and private sector expansion. However, issues like structural imbalances, fiscal rigidity, and high public debt need ongoing reforms.

The economic outlook is encouraging, with stabilizing macroeconomic fundamentals and gradual recovery of key sectors. Inflation is expected to stabilize around long term average 7 percent in the coming quarters, promoting economic activity and likely leading to further policy rate reductions resulting in lower borrowing costs which will further should boost investment and economic momentum, especially in Large Scale Manufacturing and services, the key growth drivers this year.

Trade dynamics are forecasted to improve, with growth in exports and imports supporting broader economic activity. Remittance inflows are expected to continue rising, contributing to a stable external account and boosting household consumption. Reduced borrowing costs will enhance fiscal sustainability and strengthen public finances, paving the way for economic recovery initiatives.

These trends suggest potential reductions in unemployment as economic activity gains momentum. With sustained reforms and resilience, Pakistan's economy is on a path towards greater stability and prosperity.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT

## Chunk 62

# Review Report on the Statement of Compliance contained in Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019

We have reviewed the enclosed Statement of Compliance with the Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019 (the Regulations) prepared by the Board of Directors of Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited ('the Bank') for the year ended 31 December 2024 in accordance with the requirements of regulation 36 of the Regulations.

The responsibility for compliance with the Regulations is that of the Board of Directors of the Bank. Our responsibility is to review whether the Statement of Compliance reflects the status of the Bank's compliance with the provisions of the Regulations and report if it does not and to highlight any non-compliance with the requirements of the Regulations. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of the Bank's personnel and review of various documents prepared by the Bank to comply with the Regulations.

As part of our audit of the financial statements we are required to obtain an understanding of the accounting and internal control systems sufficient to plan the audit and develop an effective audit approach. We are not required to consider whether the Board of Directors' statement on internal control covers all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of such internal controls, the Bank's corporate governance procedures and risks.

The Regulations require the Bank to place before the Audit Committee, and upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, place before the Board of Directors for their review and approval, its related party transactions. We are only required and have ensured compliance of this requirement to the extent of the approval of the related party transactions by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the Statement of Compliance does not appropriately reflect the Bank's compliance, in all material respects, with the requirements contained in the Regulations as applicable to the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2024.

## Chunk 63

# MANAGEMENT EVALUATION OF INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM

An internal control system is a set of procedures and activities designed to identify, evaluate and mitigate the risk in processes and operations in order to support the overall business objectives of the Bank. It is the responsibility of the Bank's management to establish an internal control system to maintain an adequate and effective internal control environment on an ongoing basis.

The management of the Bank has formulated, implemented, and maintained a system of internal controls approved by the Board of Directors, the goal of which is to achieve effectiveness and efficiency of operations while adhering to laws and regulations, resulting in reliability of financial reporting. However, any system of internal controls can only be designed to manage, rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve objectives. It can therefore only provide reasonable assurance and not absolute assurance against material misstatement and loss. It also requires continuous improvement to align it with the changing environment and needs of the business.

The Bank monitors its processes and operations on an ongoing basis to ensure that an effective and efficient internal control system remains active and implemented and strive for continuous strengthening of its control environment. The internal control structure comprises of different levels of monitoring activities.

Line Management's role is to monitor day-to-day operations and ensure that the business risks are properly mitigated, control breaches are identified on a timely basis and corrective actions are promptly implemented.

The Compliance Division of the Bank is entrusted with the responsibility to minimize compliance risk and strengthen compliance environment across the organization and ensure a professional working relationship with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and other regulatory bodies. The Management has established a Management Compliance Committee to oversee compliance and controls related matters of the bank. Compliance status of irregularities identified and other compliance related matters are reported to the Bank's Management Compliance Committee, while significant compliance matters are also reported to Board Risk & Compliance Committee. Further, compliance status of observations highlighted in regulatory inspection reports are also presented in Board Risk & Compliance Committee. The Division also has a Financial Crimes and Compliance function to ensure compliance with the relevant AML / CFT / CPF Laws & Regulations.

Internal Audit Division is an independent function and follows a risk-based approach to provide reasonable assurance to the governing authorities on adequacy and effectiveness of the Bank's procedures, processes, controls and systems. All significant / material observations made through internal audit activities are reported to the Board Audit Committee (BAC) on a regular basis, which actively monitors and tracks resolution of these observations and provides guidance in improving the overall control environment of the Bank.

Based upon the results achieved from reviews, ongoing testing of financial reporting controls and audits conducted during the year 2024, management considers that, the existing system of internal controls is adequate and has been effectively implemented and monitored.

# Shariah Board's Opinion

As per the Shariah Governance Framework, the Board of Directors and the executive management are solely responsible to ensure that the operations of the Bank are conducted in a manner that comply with Shariah principles at all times, while we are required to submit a report on the overall Shariah compliance environment of the Bank.

To establish our opinion as expressed in this report, we have reviewed the reports of Shariah Compliance Department, Internal Shariah Audit and External Shariah Audit who had carried out their reviews and audits, on test check basis for each class of transactions with the relevant documentation and process flows.

Based on the above, we are of the view that:

1. The Bank has complied with Shariah rules and principles in the light of fatawa, rulings and guidelines issued by its Shariah Board.
2. The Bank has complied with directives, regulations, instructions and guidelines related to Shariah compliance issued by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in accordance with the rulings of SBP's Shariah Advisory Committee.
3. The Bank has a comprehensive mechanism in place to ensure Shariah compliance in their overall operations.
4. The Bank has a well-defined system in place sound enough to ensure that any earnings realized from sources or by means prohibited by Shariah have been credited to charity account and are being properly utilized for charitable purposes.
5. The Bank has complied with the SBP instructions on profit & loss distribution and pool management.
6. The Learning Department and the management have arranged various Islamic Banking capacity building sessions and are in continuous process to enhance Islamic Banking learning environment. In this regard, the level of awareness, capacity and sensitization of the staff, management and the Board in appreciating the importance of Shariah compliance in the products and processes of the Bank, is acceptable.
7. The Shariah Board has been provided adequate resources enabling it to discharge its duties. However, considering the increase in the business, network and volume of the work, it is suggested to further strengthen the Shariah compliance function in the Bank.

# Information other than the Unconsolidated Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Bank's Annual Report but does not include the consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements and our auditor's reports thereon.

Our opinion on the unconsolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the unconsolidated financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

---

## Chunk 78

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the unconsolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank's financial reporting process.

---

## Chunk 79

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the unconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the unconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

---

## Chunk 92

# 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

# 2.1

These unconsolidated financial statements represent separate financial statements of the Bank. The consolidated financial statements of the Bank and its subsidiary companies are being separately issued. In accordance with the directives of the Federal Government regarding the shifting of the banking system to Islamic mode, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued various circulars from time to time. Permissible forms of trade related modes of financing include purchase of goods by banks from their customers and immediate resale to them at appropriate profit in price on deferred payment basis. The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these financial statements as such, but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilised and the appropriate portion of profit thereon. Key financial figures of the Islamic banking branches are disclosed in Annexure II to these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 2.2

The Bank believes that there is no significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the unconsolidated financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.

---

## Chunk 93

# 2.3 Statement of Compliance

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards comprise of:

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP), as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) from time to time.

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of the IFRS or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

---

## Chunk 94

# 2.3

# Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published approved accounting standards

SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment Property' for Banking Companies in Pakistan through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated 26 August 2002 till further instructions. Also, SECP has deferred the applicability of IFRS 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' through its notification S.R.O. 411(I)/2008 dated 28 April 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 2.3.2

The disclosures requirements of IFAS 3, 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits' for Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) relating to annual and quarterly financial statements have been based on a format prescribed by SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 02 dated 09 February 2023.

---

## Chunk 95

# 2.3.3

IFRS 10, 'Consolidated Financial Statements' was made applicable from period beginning on or after 01 January 2015 vide S.R.O. 633(I)/2014 dated 10 July 2014 by SECP. However, SECP has directed through S.R.O. 56(I)/2016 dated 28 January 2016 that the requirement of consolidation under section 228 of the Companies Act, 2017 and IFRS 10, 'Consolidated Financial Statements' is not applicable in case of investment by companies in mutual funds established under trust structure.

---

## Chunk 96

# 2.3.4

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) adopted IFRS 9 through BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023, dated April 13, 2023, but deferred certain requirements. Similarly, the requirement to carry unquoted securities at fair value has been deferred until January 1, 2025. Furthermore, Islamic banking institutions may follow Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) 1 & 2 where applicable and continue existing accounting practices for other Islamic products until further instructions. Moreover, Banks have received exemption of recording income and expense at Effective interest rate. Consequently, these deferred requirements of IFRS 9 have not been considered in the preparation of these financial statements. Furthermore, Banks are required to apply modification accounting retrospectively however it will be applied only on the loans modified on or after 1st January 2020 as allowed by SBP.

In addition, due to the application of IFRS 9, SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 9, 2023, has also amended the format of the annual financial statements. Details regarding the aforementioned adoption and amendment, including the impact thereof, are discussed in more detail in note 4.1 to these unconsolidated financial statements.

Except for the above, there are certain other interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank’s accounting periods beginning January 1, 2024. However, these are not considered to be relevant or do not have any significant effect on the Bank's operations and therefore have not been detailed in these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 2.6 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires the use of certain accounting estimates. It also requires the management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Bank's accounting policies. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The areas where various assumptions and estimates are significant to the Bank's unconsolidated financial statements or where judgement was exercised in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

1. Classification, valuations and impairment of investments (note 4.4)
2. Provision against non-performing loans and advances (note 4.5.1)
3. Depreciation (note 4.6.2) and Amortisation (note 4.7)
4. Valuation of Property and equipment (4.6.2) and Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims (note 4.8)
5. Taxation (note 4.11)
6. Defined benefit plan (note 4.13.1)
7. Compensated absences (note 4.13.2)
8. Right-of-use assets (note 4.6.3) and related lease liabilities (note 4.14)
9. Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding deferred tax asset) (note 4.21)

Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods.

# 3. BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

# Accounting convention

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims which have been carried at revalued amounts, certain investments and derivative contracts which have been marked to market and are carried at fair value, obligations in respect of staff retirement benefits and lease liabilities which have been carried at present value and right-of-use assets which are initially measured at an amount equal to the corresponding lease liabilities (adjusted for any lease payments and costs) and depreciated over the respective lease terms.

# 4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as disclosed in note 4.1 below.

## Chunk 102

# 4.1 Changes in accounting policies

# 4.1.1 Revised format of unconsolidated financial statements

SBP through its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 9, 2023, has amended the format of annual financial statements of banks. All banks are required to prepare their annual financial statements on the revised format effective from accounting year starting from January 1, 2024. Accordingly, the Bank has prepared these unconsolidated financial statements on the new format prescribed by the SBP. The adoption of the new format contains additional disclosures and certain changes in the financial statements’ presentation, primarily due to the implementation of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan. However, the corresponding figures continue to be classified and disclosed in accordance with the previous financial accounting and reporting framework.

Adoption of revised financial statements format has also resulted in following material changes (due to which the corresponding presentations have also been changed):

- Right-of-use-assets (note 12) amounting to Rs 8,608,382 thousands (December 31, 2023: Rs 7,601,453 thousands) which were previously shown as part of property and equipment (note 11) are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.
- Lease liabilities (note 18) amounting to Rs 10,463,713 thousands (December 31, 2023: Rs 9,051,378 thousands) which were previously shown as part of other liabilities (note 20) are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.

## Chunk 103

# 4.1.2 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

During the year, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9: ‘Financial Instruments' (the Standard) became applicable to the Bank.

BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 5, 2022, issued by the SBP provides detailed instructions on implementation of IFRS 9 (the IFRS 9 Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks. Furthermore, the SBP wide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 and SBP wide BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 has made further amendments in the application instructions issued. All deferments made through these amendments are disclosed in statement of compliance.

The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions from January 1, 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at January 1, 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard. Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9.

a) Certain non-trading debt securities are held by the Bank in separate portfolios and are managed with an objective of realising cash flows through sale. The Bank primarily focuses on fair value information and uses that information to assess the securities’ performance and to make decisions. In addition, certain asset-backed securities have contractual cash flows that are not SPPI. These assets are therefore measured at FVTPL under IFRS 9.

b) Certain debt securities are held by the Bank in separate portfolios to meet everyday liquidity needs. The Bank seeks to minimise the costs of managing these liquidity needs and therefore actively manages the return on the portfolio. That return consists of collecting contractual payments as well as gains and losses from the sale of financial assets. The investment strategy often results in sales activity that is significant in value. The Bank considers that under IFRS 9 these securities are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. Moreover, certain equity investments held by the Bank for strategic purposes have been designated under IFRS 9 as at FVOCI.

c) Corporate debt securities that were previously classified as held-to-maturity are now classified at amortised cost. The Bank intends to hold the assets to maturity to collect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist solely of payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. (HTM to AC).

d) Advances except for Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), staff loans and modified loans are stated at cost, whereas TERF scheme and staff loans are stated at amortised cost.

## Chunk 105

# 4.1.2.2 Impact on regulatory capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the Banks, which has reduced
their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on
capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement
for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the 'Application
Instructions' issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement.

The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional
arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net
of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the “transitional
adjustment amount”) must be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the “transition period”
of five years.

Moreover, the SBP has allowed to adjust the amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions in Tier 2 Capital that
have not been added back to CET 1 and vice versa as per Annexure-A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024 dated
July 29, 2024.

Had IFRS 9 not been applied then CAR would have been higher by 18 bps from 19.29% to 19.47%.

---

## Chunk 106

# 4.1.2.3 Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are
managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do
not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value
through profit and loss (FVTPL) regardless of the business model in which they are held.

---

## Chunk 107

# Recognition and initial measurement

Debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial
liabilities are initially recognised when the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability
is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable
to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured
at transaction price. The fair value of a financial asset on initial recognition is generally its transaction price.

If the Bank determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price then the
financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value
on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in unconsolidated
profit and loss account on an appropriate basis over the life of the asset but no later than when the valuation
is wholly supported by observable market data, or the transaction is closed out. Advances other than Temporary
Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), staff loans and modified loans are initially measured at transaction price,
i.e., the amount of loan disbursed at disbursement date.

Staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) loans are recognised at fair value at the time
of disbursement. The fair value is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using the
prevailing market rates for instruments. The difference between the disbursed amount and the fair value at
initial recognition is recorded as "Prepaid employment benefit" for Staff loans under other assets and "Deferred
grant income" for TERF loans under other liabilities.

---

## Chunk 108

# Classification

# Financial Assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as either amortised cost, FVOCI, or FVPL where as Advances except for staff financing, the Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), and modified financing, are carried at cost.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

Advances are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, except for Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), staff loans and modified loans which are measured at amortised cost.

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Bank changes its business models for managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following changes in the business model.

IFRS 9 allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any 'accounting mismatch' that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising gains and losses on them on different basis. The SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout life of the instrument. Nonetheless, banks should avoid this option for financial instruments that are categorised as Level 3 in terms of the IFRS 13 hierarchy.

Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in scope of the standard are never bifurcated. Instead, the whole hybrid instrument is assessed for classification.

---

## Chunk 109

# Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit and loss account (FVTPL), when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognised in the unconsolidated profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method. Markup expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in unconsolidated profit and loss account. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in unconsolidated profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 110

# 4.1.2.4 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either Held to collect, Held to collect and sale and Others based on Business model assessment. The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to the management. The assessment requires judgement based on facts and circumstances on the date of assessment. The assessment considers the policies and objectives for the portfolio of financial assets, risk affecting, performance evaluation, business manager’s compensation and historical sales information. Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

---

## Chunk 111

# 4.1.2.5 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as interest margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Bank considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Bank considers:

- contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
- leverage features;
- prepayment and extension terms;
- terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and
- features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).

A prepayment feature aligns with SPPI if it mainly represents unpaid principal and profit, including reasonable compensation for early termination.

---

## Chunk 112

# 4.1.2.6 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

|Financial assets at FVTPL|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any markup or dividend income, are recognised in unconsolidated profit and loss account.|
|---|---|
|Financial assets at amortised cost|These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Markup, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in the unconsolidated profit and loss account.|
|Debt investments at FVOCI|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and is assessed for impairment under the new ECL model. Markup income is calculated using the effective interest method and includes Amortisation of premiums.|


and accretion of discount, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in the unconsolidated profit and loss account. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to the unconsolidated profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 113

# Equity investments at FVOCI

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit and loss account unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are adjusted from the carrying value of investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit and loss account.

# Advances

Advances are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, except for Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and staff financing, modified financing which are carried at amortised cost, net of expected credit loss allowances.

---

## Chunk 114

# 4.1.2.7 Amortised cost and gross carrying amount

The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance (or impairment allowance before 1 January 2024).

The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

---

## Chunk 115

# 4.1.2.8 Calculation of markup income and expense

Income on financial assets, comprising performing advances and debt securities and other financial assets, of the domestic operations is recognised on a time proportion basis as per the terms of the contract. However, where debt securities, classified as investments in the unconsolidated financial statements, are purchased at premium or discount, such premium / discount including the transaction cost is amortised through the unconsolidated Profit and Loss account over the remaining maturity of the debt security using the effective interest rate method. Similarly, under the local regulatory requirement, income recoverable on classified advances and investments (debt securities), is recognised on a receipt basis.

Income on rescheduled / restructured advances and investments is recognised as permitted by SBP regulations. Markup expense on financial liabilities (comprising deposits, subordinated debts, and borrowings) is recognised on an accrual basis in the period in which it is incurred, based on their contractual rates.

Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) are allowed to follow Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) 1 & 2 where applicable and continue the existing accounting methodology on other Islamic products until issuance of further instruction in this regard.

---

## Chunk 116

# 4.1.2.9 Derecognition

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

- substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred; or

- the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised), and the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI is recognised in the unconsolidated profit and loss account, except that in case of the derecognition of equity securities held at FVOCI, cumulative gains or losses are transferred to unappropriated profit.

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

---

## Chunk 117

# 4.1.2.10 Modification

# Financial assets

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification are accounted for as follows:

- fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and
- other fees are included in profit and loss account as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.

If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

Where derecognition of financial assets is appropriate, the newly recognised residual loans are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classified as purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI). If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the bank first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognised the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit and loss account. Any costs or fees incurred, and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

If such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as markup income calculated using the effective interest rate method.

---

## Chunk 118

# Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability recognised and consideration paid is recognised in profit and loss account. Consideration paid includes non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability.

If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit and loss account. For floating-rate financial liabilities, the original effective interest rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument.

---

## Chunk 119

# 4.1.2.11 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’).

---

## Chunk 120

# Restructured financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows:

- If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset.
- If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in ‘Stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘Stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘Stage 3’.

---

## Chunk 121

# Non-Performing financial assets

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit_impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘non-performing’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

---

## Chunk 122

# Evidence of Credit-Impairment

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- the restructuring of a loan by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit-impaired.

---

## Chunk 123

# IFRS 9 Application Instructions

Under the IFRS 9 Application instructions, the Bank is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. The Bank is required to calculate ECL on its non-performing financial assets as higher of provision under Prudential Regulations (PR) and ECL under IFRS 9.

---

## Chunk 124

# Stage 3 ECL Calculation

For Stage 3, The Bank calculates the ECL against corporate, commercial & SME loan portfolios as higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at borrower/facility level, whereas against the retail borrowers the Bank calculates the ECL at higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at segment/product basis as instructed under Annexure-A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024.

---

## Chunk 125

# ECL Assessment

ECL is the probability weighted estimate of expected cash shortfalls which is determined by multiplying the probability of default (PD) with the loss given default (LGD) with the expected exposure at the time of default (EAD). Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 and Application Instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

---

## Chunk 126

# Probability of Default (PD)

The Probability of Default represents the likelihood that a counterparty will default within a specific timeframe, such as 12 months (12-month ECL for Stage 1) or the lifetime of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL for Stage 2). The Bank calculates PD on Islamic financing and related assets which is further bifurcated into retail and non-retail portfolios. Following is the methodology through which non-retail and retail PD are calculated:

---

## Chunk 127

# Non-Retail PD

The Bank utilises its internal risk rating system to assign Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) to borrowers. The Bank has used a statistical method called Markov Chain, also known as Transition Matrices / Migration matrices, for the estimation of TTC PDs associated with each of its Obligor Risk Rating (ORR).

---

## Chunk 128

# Retail PD

The Bank has used market benchmark PDs for retail segments. The Bank has recently started developing its retail portfolio and does not have sufficient data to develop PD and LGD Models. In the absence of required data and after discussing with consultants, management has decided to use the market benchmark PDs and BASEL prescribed 45% LGD for retail segment. Moreover, the Bank has used its internal data to develop the TTC-PD models using Pluto and Tasche technique for the calculation of

# Expected Credit Loss (ECL) on Investments, Balances with other banks (BWOB) and Lending to FIs

TTC-PD were converted into PiT PDs by applying Macro Economic variable with Vasicek approach.

---

## Chunk 129

# Incorporation of forward-looking information:

Forward looking information is incorporated to convert TTC PD to Point in Time Probability of Default (PiT) PD. The Bank has estimated the PiT PDs using the Vasicek framework in its PD Model. For this purpose, the Bank incorporated 5-year forecasts obtained from the Macro Economic Variable (MEV) database of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The MEVs used in the Model are the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) etc.

---

## Chunk 130

# Exposure at Default (EAD):

The Bank has defined EAD for financial assets carried at an amortised cost equal to principal plus accrued markup at the default date. Each repayment date is assumed to be a default point in the model, and the ECL is calculated on the EAD at each repayment date and discounted at the effective interest rate to arrive at the discounted ECL under three scenarios, i.e., base, worst, and best-case scenarios. The unutilised exposures are multiplied with Credit Conversion Factors (CCFs) to compute the EAD of revolving facilities. For non-revolving facilities, CCF is only applied to unutilised exposures when the Bank doesn’t have unconditional right to revoke the undrawn portion. Additionally, cash and cash equivalent collateral the Bank holds against non-retail facilities are adjusted from the EAD, and ECL is calculated on the net amount. The Bank has developed CCF models for its revolving and non revolving facilities based on the historical utilisation of credit limits which are currently being applied to the revolving portfolio.

---

## Chunk 131

# Loss Given Default:

Loss Given Default (LGD) represents the forecasted economic loss in the event of default, calculated independently of credit quality and applied consistently across all stages. LGD is determined as the percentage of loss expected in case of borrower default, incorporating historical data, cash recovery experience (including settlements), costs and time of recoveries, collateral realisations, and recovery projections. For non-collateralised portfolios, the Bank estimates LGD based on actual recoveries from defaulted accounts over a historical period of 8 years prior to the assessment date. Forward-looking information is incorporated into the LGD calculation to reflect the impact of macroeconomic factors on the expected recoveries. The Bank uses a statistical approach, specifically the Jacob Frye model, to estimate Point-in-Time (PiT) LGD. This model accounts for forward-looking information, including macroeconomic variables, to estimate LGD for all credit segments.

---

## Chunk 132

# Purchase or Originated Credit Impaired Financial Assets

Purchase or Originated Credit Impaired (POCI) financial assets are assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition. Expected credit loss for these assets is not recognised in a separate loss provision on initial recognition, as the lifetime expected credit loss is inherent within the gross carrying amount of the instruments. Consequently, POCI assets do not carry an impairment allowance on initial recognition. The amount recognised as a loss allowance after initial recognition is equal to the changes in lifetime ECL since the initial recognition of the asset.

---

## Chunk 133

# Presentation of allowance for Expected Credit Loss in the Statement of Financial Position

Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the Statement of Financial Position as follows:

- financial assets measured at amortised cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets.
- loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: as a provision in Other Assets / Liabilities.

– where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Bank does not identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component and instead presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision; and

– debt instruments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance is recognised in the statement of financial position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance is disclosed and is recognised in retained earnings.

---

## Chunk 134

# 4.1.2.12 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or markup payments are 60 & 120 days past due for advances and trade bills respectively. Qualitative factors include the Watchlist and restructured/rescheduled.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PR issued by SBP. Financial assets in stage 2 may be reclassified to stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum period of 06 months from the end of downgrade reason is required before any facility is moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to move back from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it should meet the criteria defined under the respective Prudential Regulations for de-classification of account / facility and after observing of 03 months cooling off period. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022. However, banks are free to choose more stringent days past due criteria.

---

## Chunk 135

# 4.1.2.13 Write-offs

Financial assets are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level.

Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in the statement of profit and loss account and OCI.

Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Bank’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

---

## Chunk 136

# 4.1.2.14 Off-setting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

---

## Chunk 137

# 4.1.2.15 Undrawn loan commitments and guarantees:

Financial guarantees are contracts that require the Bank to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Loan commitments are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions.

When estimating lifetime ECL for undrawn loan commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the loans are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

---

## Chunk 138

# 4.1.2.16 Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank has adopted a governance framework requiring the Risk, Finance, Operations, Internal Audit and IT functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. IFRS 9 requires robust credit risk models that can predict Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD).

The Bank’s Risk Management Division has developed Models/methodologies for PD, LGD and Credit Conversion Factors (CCF). These models are validated on an annual basis considering the following aspects:

- Quantitative Validation: Expected credit loss (ECL) model design validation, data quality validation and benchmarking with external best practices.
- Quantitative Validation: Calibration testing which ensures the accuracy of the observed PDs.

The Risk Department defines the staging criteria for the new impairment model and takes ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach. Additionally, the Risk department also takes ownership of the impact of ECL on the bank's capital.

Risk Management division of the Bank is responsible for the implementation of IFRS 9. Further, the Bank has engaged a consultant for the calculation of ECL on a quarterly basis. The same is provided to the Risk Management Division which reviews and assesses the ECL and submits it to the Finance Division for financial reporting requirements.

Finance Division then uses the financial information for preparing the financial statements and related financial ratios.

Risk Management Division prepares and submits the analysis to the board risk committee on a quarterly basis. Further, financial statements prepared on the basis of IFRS-9 are then submitted to the Board Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.

The IT Department provides support to all the stakeholders for preparing and extracting the data required for the risk parameters modelling. The IT department also provides support to project owners for system development and upgrades.

# 4.2 Cash and cash equivalents

For the purpose of the unconsolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks and national prize bonds less overdrawn nostro balances.

# 4.3 Lendings to / borrowings from financial institutions

The Bank enters into transactions of borrowing (repo) from and lending (reverse repo) to financial institutions, at contracted rates for a specified period of time. These are recorded as under:

---

## Chunk 139

# Purchase under resale agreement (reverse repo)

Securities purchased with a corresponding commitment to resell at a specified future date (reverse repos) are not recognised in the unconsolidated statement of financial position and instead amounts paid under these arrangements are included in lendings to financial institutions. The difference between purchase and resale price is accrued as markup income on a pro-rata over the term of the agreement.

---

## Chunk 140

# Sale under repurchase agreement (repo)

Securities sold with a simultaneous commitment to repurchase at a specified future date (repos) continue to be recognised in the unconsolidated statement of financial position and are measured in accordance with accounting policies for investments and amount received under these agreements are recorded as repurchase agreement borrowings. The difference between sale and repurchase price is accrued as markup expense on a pro-rata basis over the term of the repo agreement.

---

## Chunk 141

# Bai Muajjal

In Bai Muajjal, the Bank sells sukuk on credit to other financial institutions. The sale / purchase price is agreed at the time of sale and such proceeds are received at the end of the credit agreed period. The sukuk sold under Bai Muajjal transaction are derecognised on the date of disposal. Receivable against such sale is recognised at the agreed sale price. The difference between the sale price and the carrying value on the date of disposal is taken to income on straight line basis.

# Musharaka / Modaraba

In Musharaka / Modaraba, the Bank invests in the Shariah compliant business pools of the financial institutions at the agreed profit sharing ratio. Loss, if any will be shared between the parties as per the investment.

---

## Chunk 142

# Musharaka from the SBP under Islamic Export Refinance Scheme (IERS)

Under IERS, the Bank accepts funds from the SBP under Shirkat-ul-aqd to constitute a pool for investment in Islamic export refinance portfolio of the Bank under the guidelines issued by the SBP. The profit of the pool is shared as per the agreed weightages between the partners.

---

## Chunk 143

# Modaraba investment from the SBP under various long term Islamic refinance schemes

Under various long term Islamic refinance schemes of the SBP, the Bank accepts funds from the SBP which are received on modaraba basis for investment in the pool of the Bank. The profit of the pool is shared as per the agreed profit sharing ratio of the pool and the weightages assigned to these investments.

# 4.4 Investments (Applicable before January 1, 2024)

# 4.4.1 Investments in subsidiaries

Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment, if any.

---

## Chunk 144

# 4.4.2 Other investments are classified as follows:

# Held-for-trading

These are securities, which are either acquired for generating profit from short-term fluctuation in market prices, interest rate movements, dealers margin or are securities included in a portfolio in which a pattern of short-term trading exists.

# Held-to-maturity

These are securities with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that are held with the positive intention and ability to hold till maturity.

Bai Muajjal transactions undertaken with the Government of Pakistan are disclosed as investments.

# Available-for-sale

These are investments except from those made in subsidiary companies and that do not fall under the held-for trading or held-to-maturity categories.

---

## Chunk 145

# 4.4.3 Initial Measurement

Investments (other than held-for-trading) include transaction costs associated with the investments. In case of held-for-trading transaction costs are charged to profit and loss account when incurred.

All “regular way” purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Bank commits the purchase or sell the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of investments that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

# Subsequent Measurement

# Held-for-trading

Investments classified as held-for-trading are subsequently measured at fair value. Any unrealised surplus / deficit arising on the revaluation of the Bank’s held-for-trading investment portfolio is taken to the profit and loss account.

# Held-to-maturity

Investments classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortised cost.

---

## Chunk 146

# Available-for-sale

Quoted securities classified as available-for-sale are subsequently measured at fair value. Any unrealised surplus / deficit arising on revaluation of quoted securities classified as available for sale is kept in a separate account shown in equity. Surplus / deficit arising on these securities is taken to the profit and loss account when actually realised upon disposal or when the investment is considered to be impaired. Unquoted equity securities are valued at the lower of cost and break-up value. Break-up value of these securities is calculated as per the latest available audited financial statements. Investments in other unquoted securities are valued at cost less impairment losses, if any.

---

## Chunk 147

# Impairment

Provision for diminution in the value of term finance certificates and sukuk certificates are made as prescribed under Prudential Regulation issued by the SBP.

Provision for impairment in the value of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities (other than Federal Government securities, term finance certificates and sukuk certificates) is made after considering objective evidence of impairment, if any, in their value (as a result of one or more events that may have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the investments). A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an equity investment below its cost is also considered an objective evidence of impairment. Impairment losses are taken to profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 148

# 4.5  Advances (Applicable before January 1, 2024)

# 4.5.1  Loans and advances

Loans and advances and net investments in finance lease are stated net of provision for loan losses against non-performing advances. Provision for loan losses is made in accordance with the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP and is charged to profit and loss account. The Bank also maintains general provision in addition to the requirements of the Prudential Regulations on the basis of management's assessment of credit risk characteristics and general banking risk such as nature of credit, collateral type, industry sector and other relevant factors. Advances are written-off in line with the Bank's policy when there are no realistic prospects of recovery.

---

## Chunk 149

# 4.5.2  Finance lease receivables

Leases where the Bank transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset to the lessee are classified as finance lease. A receivable is recognised at an amount equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments including guaranteed residual value, if any. Finance lease receivables are included in advances to the customers.

---

## Chunk 150

# 4.5.3  Islamic finance and related assets

# Ijarah

Ijarah assets are stated at cost less depreciation and are disclosed as part of 'Islamic financing and related assets. Rental received / receivable on Ijarah are recorded as income / revenue. The Bank charges depreciation from the date of recognition of Ijarah of respective assets to Lessee (mustajir). Ijarah assets are depreciated over the period of Ijarah using the straight line method. Ijarah rentals outstanding are disclosed in 'other assets' on the Statement of Financial Position at amortised cost.

---

## Chunk 151

# Diminishing Musharaka

Under diminishing musharaka based financing, the Bank enters into a musharaka based on shirkat-ul-milk for financing an agreed share of fixed asset (e.g. house, land, plant or machinery) with its customers and enters into rental payment agreement for the utilisation of the Bank's musharaka share by the customer. The Bank receives periodic payments from its customers partly for renting its portion of the assets and partly for gradual transfer / sale of its ownership. The rental payments are recognised in profit and loss account whereas transfer / sale payments are applied towards reducing the outstanding principal.

---

## Chunk 152

# Running Musharaka

Under Running Musharaka, the Bank enters into financing with the customer based on Shirkat-ul-Aqd in the customer's operating business. Under this mechanism the customer can withdraw and return funds to the Bank subject to consumer's running musharakah financing limit during the Musharaka period. At the end of each quarter / half year the customer pays the provisional profit as per the desired profit rate which is subject to final settlement based on the relevant quarterly / half yearly / annual accounts of the customer.

# Istisna

Under istisna financing, the Bank places an order to purchase some specific goods / commodities from its customers to be manufactured / delivered to the Bank within an agreed time. The goods are then sold and the amount financed along with profit is paid back to the Bank.

---

## Chunk 153

# Al-Bai

The product is based on the Islamic mode “musawamah”. Under this financing, the Bank purchases the goods from its customers on cash payment basis and after taking the possession by the Bank, the customer on behalf of the Bank sells them. Upon subsequent sale by the customer, the financed amount along with the profit is paid by the customer to the Bank.

# Murabaha

In Murabaha transactions, the Bank purchases the goods and after taking the possession, sells them to the customer on cost plus profit basis either in a spot or credit transaction.

---

## Chunk 154

# Salam

In Salam, the seller undertakes to supply specific goods to the buyer at a future date in exchange of an advanced price fully paid at spot. The payment is at spot but the supply of purchased goods is deferred. The purchased goods by the Bank are then sold by the customer on behalf of the Bank and the financed amount along with profit is paid to the Bank.

---

## Chunk 155

# 4.6 Property and equipment

# 4.6.1 Capital work-in-progress

Capital work in progress is stated at cost less impairment loss, if any and consists of expenditures incurred and advances made in the course of their construction and installation. Transfers are made to relevant asset category as and when assets are available for intended use.

---

## Chunk 156

# 4.6.2 Property and equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, except for land and buildings which are carried at revalued amount, less any applicable accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Land and buildings are stated at revalued amount less accumulated depreciation (in case of buildings) and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset at the rates specified in note 11.2 to these unconsolidated financial statements. Depreciation on additions during the year is calculated from the date of addition. In case of disposals during the year, the depreciation is charged till the date of disposal. Subsequent cost are included in the asset's carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account.

An item of property and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is recognised in the profit and loss account in the year the asset is derecognised. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed and changes, if any, are treated as change in accounting estimates, at each statement of financial position date. Land and buildings are revalued by independent professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. If an asset’s carrying value increases as a result of revaluation, such increase or surplus arising on revaluation is credited to the surplus on revaluation of property and equipment account. If an asset’s carrying amount is decreased as a result of a revaluation, the decrease

shall be recognised in the unconsolidated profit or loss account. However, if the increase reverses a deficit on the same asset previously recognised in the unconsolidated profit and loss account, such an increase is also recognised in the unconsolidated profit and loss account to the extent of the previous deficit and thereafter in the surplus on the revaluation of property and equipment account.

In the case of revalued assets, any accumulated depreciation on the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the net asset and the net amount restated at the revalued amount of the asset. Surplus on revaluation of property and equipment (net of any associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit.

Surplus on revaluation (net of any deferred tax) realised on disposal of land and building is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

---

## Chunk 157

# 4.6.3 Right-of-use assets and their related lease liabilities

The Bank recognises a right-of-use asset and lease liability (note 4.14) at the lease commencement date. The right of-use asset is initially measured at amount equal to present value of lease liability, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight line method from the commencement date to the earlier of end of the useful life of right-of-use asset or end of the lease term.

---

## Chunk 158

# 4.7 Intangible assets

These are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any. The cost of intangible assets are amortised from the month when the assets are available for intended use, using the straight line method, whereby the cost of the intangible asset is amortised over its estimated useful life over which economic benefits are expected to flow to the Bank. The useful life and amortisation method is reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each unconsolidated statement of financial position date.

---

## Chunk 159

# 4.8 Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are initially recorded at cost and subsequently carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. These assets are revalued by professionally qualified valuators with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value.

A surplus arising on revaluation of property is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets' account and any deficit arising on revaluation is taken to the unconsolidated profit and loss account directly. Legal fees, transfer costs and direct costs of acquiring title to property is charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account.

Depreciation on assets (other than land) acquired in satisfaction of claims is charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account on the same basis as depreciation charged on the Bank's property and equipment.

If the recognition of such assets results in a reduction in non-performing loans, such reductions and the corresponding reductions in provisions held against non-performing loans are disclosed separately.

These assets are generally intended for sale. Gains and losses realised on the sale of such assets are disclosed separately from gains and losses realised on the sale of property and equipment. Surplus on revaluation (net of deferred tax) realised on disposal of these assets is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

If such an asset is subsequently used by the Bank for its own operations, the asset is transferred to property and equipment along with any related surplus.

---

## Chunk 160

# 4.9 Derivative financial instruments

Derivative financial instruments consist of Forward foreign exchange contracts, which are initially recognised at fair value at the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. All derivative financial instruments are carried as asset when fair value is positive and liabilities when fair value is negative. Any change in the value of derivative financial instruments is taken to the unconsolidated profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 161

# 4.10 Credit loss allowance / Provisions

Expected credit loss allowance against identified off-balance exposure is recognised when intimated and reasonable certainty exists for the Bank to settle the obligation. The loss is charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account net of expected recovery and is classified under other liabilities.

Other provisions are recognised when the Bank has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each unconsolidated statement of financial position date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.

# 4.11 Taxation

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the unconsolidated profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to the items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

---

## Chunk 162

# 4.11.1 Current

Provision for current taxation is based on taxable income for the year at the current rates of taxation after taking into consideration available tax credits and rebates. The charge for the current tax also includes adjustments where considered necessary, relating to prior years which arise from assessments framed / finalised during the year.

---

## Chunk 163

At each unconsolidated statement of financial position date, the Bank reviews the carrying amount of its assets (other than deferred tax asset) to determine whether there is an indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of relevant asset is estimated. Recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and value in use. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the assets is reduced to its recoverable amount. The resulting impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the unconsolidated profit and loss account. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. Details of the basis of determination of impairment against loans and advances and investments have been discussed in their respective notes.

Under the Workers' Welfare Ordinance 1971, the Bank is liable to pay workers' welfare fund (WWF) @ 2% of accounting profit before tax or taxable income, whichever is higher. The Bank has made full provision for WWF based on profit for the respective years.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated November 10, 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of WWF were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending.

Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions the judgement may not currently be treated as conclusive. Accordingly the Bank maintains its provision in respect of WWF.

34.1 Income tax assessments of the Bank have been finalised up to the tax year 2024 (corresponding to the accounting year ended 31 December 2023). Certain appeals are pending with the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) and Sindh High Court. However, adequate provisions are being held by the Bank.

34.2 This reflects provision made, on prudent basis, for additional tax imposed by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) through its notification dated 21 November 2023 on the foreign exchange income of the banking sector at the rate of 40% for the financial year ended 31 Dec 2021 and 31 Dec 2022. The Bank has challenged the imposition of additional tax before the Sindh High Court which has granted stay against such demand. The matter is currently pending for final adjudication.

Sensitivity analysis has been performed by varying one assumption keeping all other assumptions constant and calculating the impact on the present value of the defined benefit obligations under the various employee benefit schemes. The increase / (decrease) in the present value of defined benefit obligations as a result of change in each assumption is summarized below:

## Chunk 264

# 38.15 Significant risk associated with the staff retirement benefit schemes include:

- Asset volatility: The risk of the investment underperforming and being not sufficient to meet the liabilities. The duration of the liabilities is 9.6 Years. Based on the weighted average duration of this plan and guidance from Pakistan Society of Actuaries (“PSOA”), the discount rate used for the calculations is 16.00% per annum.
- Inflation risk: The risk that the final salary at the time of cessation of service is greater than what we assumed. Since the benefit is calculated on the final salary (which will closely reflect inflation and other macroeconomic factors), the benefit amount increases as salary increases.
- Mortality rate: The risk that the actual mortality experience is different than the assumed mortality. This effect is more pronounced in schemes where the age and service distribution is on the higher side.
- Withdrawal rate: The risk of actual withdrawals experience is different from assumed withdrawal probability. The significance of the withdrawal risk varies with the age, service and the entitled benefits of the beneficiary.

41. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than investment in subsidiaries and those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

The fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings are frequently repriced.

41.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# Financial Instruments Analysis

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorized:

# 41.3 Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 2

Federal government debt securities: The fair value of government securities are valued using PKRV, PKFRV, PKISRV and PSX rates.

Debt securities other than federal government securities: The fair value is determined using the prices / rates available on Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) / Reuters website and PSX.

Forward contracts: The fair values are derived using forward exchange rates applicable to their respective remaining maturities.

Mutual funds: The fair value is determined based on the net asset values published at the close of each business day.

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values of non-financial assets within level 2

Property and equipment and non-banking assets are valued by professionally qualified valuators. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. In determining the valuation for land and building the valuer refers to numerous independent market inquiries from local estate agents / realtors in the vicinity to establish the present market value. The fair valuation of land and building are considered to represent a level 2 valuation based on significant non-observable inputs being the location and condition of the assets.

The fair value is subject to change owing to changes in input. However, management does not expect there to be a material sensitivity to the fair value arising from the non-observable inputs.

# 46. RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk management aspects are embedded in the Bank’s strategy, organization structure and processes. The Bank has adopted a cohesive risk management structure for credit, market, liquidity and operational risk with an integrated approach to strengthen the process and system as controls are more effective and valuable when built into the process. Effective risk management is considered essential in the preservation of the assets and long-term profitability of the Bank. Clear guidelines and limits, which are under regular review, are backed by a system of internal controls and independent audit inspections. Internal reporting / MIS are additional tools for measuring and controlling risks. Separation of duties is also embedded in the Bank’s system and organization.

## Chunk 291

# 46.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counterparty in a transaction may default. It arises principally in relation to the lending and trade finance business carried out by the Bank.

As per Basel II methodology the gross credit risk weighted exposure incorporating relevant credit conversion factor is Rs. 455,454,722 thousand (2023: Rs. 414,494,946 thousand) as depicted in note 44.

The Bank’s strategy is to minimize credit risk through a strong pre-disbursement credit analysis, approval and risk measurement process added with product, geography and customer diversification. The Bank, as its strategic preference, extends trade and working capital financing, so as to keep the major portion of exposure (funded and non-funded) on a short-term, self-liquidating basis. Major portion of the Bank's credit portfolio is priced on flexible basis with pricing reviewed on periodic basis.

With the expansion of the Consumer lending portfolio, the Credit Review & Administration efforts have been accordingly enhanced by inducting specialized consumer credit risk analysts and processing specialists.

Centralized Credit and Trade processing centre staffed with experienced resource provide strength to post-disbursement aspect of credit risk management.

The Bank’s credit policy / manual defines the credit extension criteria, the credit approval and monitoring process, the loan classification system and provisioning policy.

The Bank continually assesses and monitors credit exposures. The Bank follows both objective and subjective criteria of SBP regarding loans classification. The subjective assessment process is based on management's judgement with respect to the borrower's character, activity, cash flow, capital structure, security, quality of management and delinquency.

The Bank uses the 'Standardised Approach' in calculation of credit risk and capital requirements.

The Bank uses reputable and SBP approved rating agencies for deriving risk weight to specific credit exposures. These are applied consistently across the Bank credit portfolio for both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. The methodology applied for using External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAI's) inclusive of the alignment of alpha numeric scale of each agency used with risk bucket is as per SBP guidelines as is given below:

The forms of collateral that are deemed eligible under the ‘Simple Approach’ to credit risk mitigation as per SBP guidelines are used by the Bank and primarily includes cash, government, equity investment in blue chip companies and rated debt securities.

The Bank applies SBP specified haircut to collateral for credit risk mitigation. Collateral management is embedded in the Bank’s risk taking and risk management policy and procedures. A standard credit granting procedure exists which has been well-disseminated down the line, ensuring proper pre-sanction evaluation, adequacy of security, pre-examination of charge/control documents and monitoring of each exposure on an ongoing basis.

Collateral information is recorded diligently in the Bank's main processing systems by type of collateral, amount of collateral against relevant credit exposures. A cohesive accounting/risk management system facilitates effective collateral management for Basel II reporting.

# 46.1.7 Incorporation of forward-looking information in ECL

The assessment of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculation incorporates forward looking information. Forward-looking aspect introduces an extra dimension, which is often captured by relating expected losses to the macro-economic variables. The incorporation of macroeconomic factors increases the accuracy of the results produced and makes it more reliable to predict estimate future results more accurately.

The Bank uses historic and forecasted data to determine the impact of macroeconomic factors to estimate Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) etc. Further, statistical models based on historical correlation is performed to identify most significant macro-economic variable(s) that have been recognized as contributors to the default performance of the portfolio. The macro-economic variables (including KSE 100 Index, Consumer Price Index and Crude Oil Price) used in the ECL calculation are fetched from the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) database and the relevant macro-economic variables are selected based on sensitivity of each of the portfolios to specific macro-economic variables. Three macroeconomic scenarios have been developed base, best, and worst with assigned scenario probability weightings of 70%, 15%, and 15% respectively.

The Bank conducted a sensitivity analysis on macro-economic indicators which are utilized for forward-looking calculations. As of December 31, 2024, when the macro-economic indicators in the base scenario was adjusted upwards or downwards by 10%, the ECL showed the following variation:

|Segment|Upwards|Downwards|
|---|---|---|
|Corporate|-9.59%|15.34%|
|SME|-5.69%|8.64%|
|Retail|-30.93%|37.05%|

# 46.1.8 Sensitivity of ECL to future economic conditions

The ECL are sensitive to judgements and assumption made regarding formulation of forward-looking scenarios and how much such scenarios are incorporated into calculations. The Bank performs sensitivity analysis on the ECL recognised on each of its segments.

The table below shows the loss allowance on each segment assuming each forward-looking scenario (e.g. Base, worst and best) were weighted 100% instead of applying scenario probability across the three scenarios.

# 46.2.2 Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk is the probability of loss resulting from adverse movement in exchange rates. The Bank’s business model for foreign exchange risk is to serve trading activities of its clients in an efficient and cost effective manner. The Bank is not in the business of actively trading and market making activities and all FX exposures are backed by customers' trade transaction. A conservative risk approach backed by Bank’s business strategy to work with export oriented clients gives the ability to meet its foreign exchange needs.

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in the market interest rates. Interest rate risk is also controlled through flexible credit pricing mechanism and variable deposit rates. Duration analysis and stress testing are being carried out regularly to estimate the impact of adverse changes in the interest rates on bank's fixed income portfolio. Optimization of yield is achieved through the Bank’s investment strategy which aims on attaining a balance between yield and liquidity under the strategic guidance of the ALCO. The advances and deposits of the Bank are repriced on a periodic basis based on interest rates scenario.

# 46.3 Operational Risk

The Bank operates in a controlled manner and operational risk is managed effectively. With the evolution of operational risk management (ORM) into a separate distinct discipline, the Bank’s strategy is to further strengthen operational risk management system along new industry standards.

The Bank’s ORM strategy takes guidance from Basel - II, the SBP guidelines and best industry practices. The Bank’s ORM framework includes Risk Control Self-Assessment (RCSA), Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), Operational Risk Events Management, Change Risk Assessment and Risk Assessment of Outsourcing arrangement. The ORM unit engages with Bank’s business/support units and regularly collaborates in determining and reviewing the inherent operational risks, and assessment of residual risk leading to improved quality of control infrastructure and further strengthening of the processes & management information. Moreover, Bank wide policies, procedures, frameworks and product programs are also being evaluated from operational risk perspective aiming to beef up control environment.

The Bank’s business continuity plan includes risk management strategies to mitigate inherent risk and prevent interruption of mission critical services caused by disaster event. The Business Continuity Management function with the support of the senior management remained extremely active during the pandemic to ensure that stakeholders remained safe, all critical services and processes of the bank remain operational and any contingency arising is dealt appropriately. The Bank’s operational risk management governance has been further strengthened through the establishment of a separate operational risk and control committee.

The Bank uses Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) for regulatory capital at risk calculation for operational risk. Under BIA the capital charge for operational risk is a fixed percentage of average positive annual gross income of the Bank over the past three years. Figures of capital charge of operation risk for the year is Rs. 11,554,334 thousand (2023: Rs. 9,064,742 thousand).

# 46.4 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank will not be able to raise funds to meet its commitments.

# Governance of Liquidity risk management

The ALCO continuously monitors the liquidity position and the Bank is confident that the current liquidity buffer is sufficient to cater to any adverse movement in the maturity profile.

Liquidity and related risks are managed through standardized processes established in the Bank. The management of liquidity risk within the Bank is undertaken within limits and other parameters set by the BoD. The Bank's treasury function has the primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing the Bank's liquidity and funding strategy while overall compliance is monitored and coordinated by the ALCO. Board and senior management are apprised of the Bank’s liquidity profile to ensure proactive liquidity management. Treasury Middle Office being part of the risk management division is responsible for the independent identification, monitoring and analysis of intrinsic risks of treasury business. The Bank has in place duly approved Treasury investment policy and strategy along with liquidity risk tolerance / appetite levels. These are communicated at various levels so as to ensure effective liquidity management for the Bank.

# Funding Strategy

Habib Metro’s strong deposit base backed by continued customer confidence and holding of government securities has enabled the bank to maintain a robust liquidity profile, also depicted through a strong LCR ratio.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Following are the Key audit matter:

|S. No.|Key Audit Matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|Credit loss allowance against advances and off-balance sheet items: (Refer note 10.6 & 20.1 to the consolidated financial statements) As at 31 December 2024, the Bank's Credit loss allowance against advances and off-balance sheet items amounted to Rs. 30,475 million and Rs. 354 million, respectively. As per the BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023, the Bank adopted requirements of IFRS 9 along with the Application Instructions issued by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) (hereafter referred as “application instruction of IFRS 9”) from 1 January 2024 which requires the Bank to recognise Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on advances and off-balance sheet items. The estimation of ECL, involves judgement and complexity.|Our audit procedures, amongst others, included the following: l Performing risk assessment procedures over the credit loss allowance against advances and off-balance sheet exposure within the Bank's consolidated financial statement. As part of these risk assessment procedures, identifying the elements associated with risk of material misstatement on application including those arising from judgements over the estimation of ECL either due to, methods / models, assumptions or data. l Assessing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls established by the Bank over measurement of ECL and provision calculated as per PR.|

# Key Audit Matter

|S. No.|Key Audit Matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|The key areas which are subject to complexity and judgement in the estimation of ECL are: - Model estimations - judgmental modelling and assumptions are used to estimate ECL which involves determining Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD). Respective model's assumptions are key driver of uncertainty, and are required in the application of these model for calculation of the ECL estimate.
- Economic scenarios - IFRS 9 requires the Bank to measure ECL on an unbiased forward-looking basis reflecting a range of future economic conditions. Complex Statistical methodology is applied in determining the forward-looking economic scenarios used as an input to calculate ECL, the associated scenario probability weightings, and the key economic variables that drive the scenarios.
- Qualitative criteria - the criteria selected to identify a SICR involves judgment and can lead to unreliable ECL recognised for certain portfolios.
|- Involved in-house specialist who assisted in the following: - Evaluating the Bank's ECL model methodologies for compliance with application instructions of IFRS 9
- Assessing the reasonableness of the Bank's methodology for determining the economic scenarios used and the probability weightings applied to them by independently validating and challenging the assumption, methodologies, and outputs of the models;
- Assessing the reasonableness of macro-economic variables and economic forecasts by comparing these to external sourced data extracted;
- Performing independent testing of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) allowance on a sample basis.
- Assessing the appropriateness of SICR criteria applied by the Bank by ensuring that the SICR criteria and staging methodology are consistent with the application instructions of IFRS 9.
- Ensuring relevance and completeness of the key inputs into the ECL calculations with their respective sub-ledgers and general ledgers.
- Performing testing on sample basis over key inputs into the ECL calculations with their respective source documents.
- Performing sensitivity analysis on the key assumption, that is probability weighted economic scenarios, to assess reasonableness and the risk of biasness by changing weights assigned to each economic scenario.
- In accordance with the PR, we sampled at least sixty percent of the total advances outstanding exposure and performed credit reviews through the following substantive procedures: - Verifying repayments of advances / interest installments and checked that non-performing advances have been correctly classified and categorised based on the number of days overdue;
- Examining watch list accounts and, based on review of the individual facts and circumstances, discussions with management and our assessment of financial conditions of the borrowers, formed a judgement as to whether classification of these accounts as performing was appropriate;

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan and the Companies Act, 2017 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

## Chunk 350

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,

Individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.
- Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Zeeshan Rashid.

Key financial figures of the Islamic banking branches are disclosed in Annexure II to these consolidated financial statements.

# 2.3.5

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) adopted IFRS 9 through BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023, dated April 13, 2023, but deferred certain requirements.

Furthermore, Islamic banking institutions may follow IFAS 1 & 2 where applicable and continue existing accounting practices for other Islamic products until further instructions. Moreover, Banks have received exemption of recording income at Effective interest rate. Consequently, these deferred requirements of IFRS 9 have not been considered in the preparation of these financial statements.

## Chunk 371

# 2.6  Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires the use of certain accounting estimates. It also requires the management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The areas where various assumptions and estimates are significant to the Group's consolidated financial statements or where judgement was exercised in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

1. Classification, Valuations and impairment of investments (note 4.4)
2. Provision against non-performing loans and advances (note 4.5.1)
3. Depreciation (note 4.6.2) and Amortisation (note 4.7)
4. Valuation of Property and equipment (4.6.2) and Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims (note 4.8)
5. Taxation (note 4.11)
6. Defined benefit plan (note 4.13.1)
7. Compensated Absences (note 4.13.2)
8. Right-of-use assets (note 4.6.3) and related lease liability (note 4.14)
9. Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding deferred tax asset) (note 4.21)

Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods.

## Chunk 373

# 4.    MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as disclosed in note 4.1 below.

## Chunk 374

# 4.1  Changes in accounting policies

# 4.1.1   Revised format of consolidated financial statements

SBP through its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 9, 2023, has amended the format of annual financial statements of banks. All banks are required to prepare their annual financial statements on the revised format effective from accounting year starting from January 1, 2024. Accordingly, the Group has prepared these annual financial statements on the new format prescribed by the SBP. The adoption of the new format contains additional

disclosures and certain changes in the financial statements’ presentation, primarily due to the implementation of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan. However, the corresponding figures continue to be classified and disclosed in accordance with the previous financial accounting and reporting framework.

Adoption of revised financial statements format has also resulted in following material changes (due to which the corresponding presentations have also been changed):

- Right-of-use-assets (note 12) amounting to Rs 8,654,445 thousands (December 31, 2023: Rs 7,625,010 thousands) which were previously shown as part of property and equipment (note 11) are now shown separately on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
- Lease liabilities (note 18) amounting to Rs 10,519,685 thousands (December 31, 2023: Rs 9,086,176 thousands) which were previously shown as part of other liabilities (note 20) are now shown separately on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

---

## Chunk 375

# 4.1.2 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

During the period, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9:‘Financial Instruments' (the Standard) became applicable to the Group.

BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 issued by SBP provides detailed instructions on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks.

Furthermore, SBP wide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 and SBP wide BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 has made further amendments in the application instructions issued. All deferments made through these amendments are disclosed in statement of compliance.

The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on‘expected credit losses' (ECL) approach rather than‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Group which are exposed to credit risk.

The Group has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions from January 1, 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at 1 January 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard. Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9.

a) Certain non-trading debt securities are held by the Bank in separate portfolios and are managed with an objective of realising cash flows through sale. The Bank primarily focuses on fair value information and uses that information to assess the securities’ performance and to make decisions. In addition, certain asset-backed securities have contractual cash flows that are not SPPI. These assets are therefore measured at FVTPL under IFRS 9.

b) Certain debt securities are held by the Bank in separate portfolios to meet everyday liquidity needs. The Bank seeks to minimise the costs of managing these liquidity needs and therefore actively manages the return on the portfolio. That return consists of collecting contractual payments as well as gains and losses from the sale of financial assets. The investment strategy often results in sales activity that is significant in value. The Bank considers that under IFRS 9 these securities are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. Moreover, certain equity investments held by the Bank for strategic purposes have been designated under IFRS 9 as at FVOCI.

c) Corporate debt securities that were previously classified as held-to-maturity are now classified at amortised cost. The Bank intends to hold the assets to maturity to collect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist solely of payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. (HTM to AC).

d) Advances except for Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), staff loans and modified loans are stated at cost, whereas TERF scheme and staff loans are stated at amortised cost.

e) The above balances includes the balance of subsidiaries on which IFRS 9 became applicable in prior years. Accordingly, the above impact only includes the impact on the Bank balances only.

## Chunk 377

# 4.1.2.2 Impact on regulatory capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of The Groups, which has reduced their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for The Groups to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the 'Application Instructions' issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement.

The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the “transitional adjustment amount”) must be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the “transition period” of five years.

Moreover, the SBP has allowed to adjust the amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions in Tier 2 Capital that have not been added back to CET 1 and vice versa as per Annexure-A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024.

Had IFRS 9 not been applied then CAR would have been higher by 18 bps from 18.88% to 19.06%.

# 4.1.2.3 Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) regardless of the business model in which they are held.

---

## Chunk 379

# Recognition and initial measurement

Debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at transaction price. The fair value of a financial asset on initial recognition is generally its transaction price.

If The Group determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in consolidated profit and loss account on an appropriate basis over the life of the asset but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data, or the transaction is closed out. Advances other than Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), staff loans and modified loans are initially measured at transaction price, i.e., the amount of loan disbursed at disbursement date.

Staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) loans are recognised at fair value at the time of disbursement. The fair value is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using the prevailing market rates for instruments. The difference between the disbursed amount and the fair value at initial recognition is recorded as "Deferred staff loan impact" for Staff loans under other assets and "Deferred grant income - TERF" for TERF loans under other liabilities.

---

## Chunk 380

# Classification

# Financial Assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as either amortised cost, FVOCI, or FVTPL whereas Advances except for staff financing, the Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), and modified financing, are carried at cost.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, The Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

Advances are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, except for Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), staff loans and modified loans which are measured at amortised cost.

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless The Group changes its business models for managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following changes in the business model.

IFRS 9 allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any 'accounting mismatch' that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different basis. The SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout life of the instrument.

Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in scope of the standard are never bifurcated. Instead, the whole hybrid instrument is assessed for classification.

---

## Chunk 381

# Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit and loss account (FVTPL), when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method. Markup expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in consolidated profit and loss account. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in consolidated profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 382

# 4.1.2.4 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either Held to collect, Held to collect and sale and Others based on Business model assessment. The Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to the management. The assessment requires judgement based on facts and circumstances on the date of assessment. The assessment considers the policies and objectives for the portfolio of financial assets, risk affecting, performance evaluation, business manager’s compensation and historical sales information. Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

---

## Chunk 383

# 4.1.2.5 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as interest margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, The Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, The Group considers:

- contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
- leverage features;
- prepayment and extension terms;
- terms that limit The Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and
- features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).

A prepayment feature aligns with SPPI if it mainly represents unpaid principal and profit, including reasonable compensation for early termination.

---

## Chunk 384

# 4.1.2.6 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

|Financial assets at FVTPL|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any markup or dividend income, are recognised in consolidated profit and loss account.|
|---|---|
|Financial assets at amortised cost|These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Markup, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account.|
|Debt investments at FVOCI|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and is assessed for impairment under the new ECL model. Markup income is calculated using the effective interest method and includes amortisation of premiums and accretion of discount, foreign exchange gains and losses and|


impairment are recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to the consolidated profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 385

# Equity investments at FVOCI

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit and loss account unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are adjusted from the carrying value of investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit and loss account.

# Advances

Advances are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, except for Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and staff financing, modified financing which are carried at amortised cost, net of expected credit loss allowances.

---

## Chunk 386

# 4.1.2.7 Amortised cost and gross carrying amount

The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance (or impairment allowance before 1 January 2024).

The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

---

## Chunk 387

# 4.1.2.8 Calculation of markup income and expense

Income on financial assets, comprising performing advances and debt securities and other financial assets, of the domestic operations is recognised on a time proportion basis as per the terms of the contract. However, where debt securities, classified as investments in the financial statements, are purchased at premium or discount, such premium / discount including the transaction cost is amortised through the consolidated Profit and Loss account over the remaining maturity of the debt security using the effective interest rate method. Similarly, under the local regulatory requirement, income recoverable on classified advances and investments (debt securities), is recognised on a receipt basis.

Income on rescheduled / restructured advances and investments is recognised as permitted by SBP regulations. Markup expense on financial liabilities (comprising deposits, subordinated debts, and borrowings) is recognised on an accrual basis in the period in which it is incurred, based on their contractual rates.

Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) are allowed to follow Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) 1 & 2 where applicable and continue the existing accounting methodology on other Islamic products until issuance of further instruction in this regard.

---

## Chunk 388

# 4.1.2.9 Derecognition

The Group derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or

- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

- substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred; or
- The Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised), and the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI is recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account, except that in case of the derecognition of equity securities held at FVOCI, cumulative gains or losses are transferred to unappropriated profit.

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

---

## Chunk 389

# 4.1.2.10 Modification

# Financial assets

The Group sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification are accounted for as follows:

- fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and
- other fees are included in profit and loss account as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.

If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If The Group plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

Where derecognition of financial assets is appropriate, the newly recognised residual loans are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classified as purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI).

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then The Group first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognised the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit and loss account. Any costs or fees incurred, and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

If such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as markup income calculated using the effective interest rate method.

---

## Chunk 390

# Financial liabilities

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability recognised and consideration paid is recognised in profit and loss account. Consideration paid includes non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability.

If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit and loss account. For floating-rate financial liabilities, the original effective interest rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument.

---

## Chunk 391

# 4.1.2.11 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’).

---

## Chunk 392

# Restructured financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows:

- If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset.
- If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in ‘Stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘Stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘Stage 3’.

---

## Chunk 393

# Non-Performing financial assets

At each reporting date, The Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘non-performing’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- the restructuring of a loan by The Group on terms that The Group would not consider otherwise;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit-impaired.

Under the IFRS 9 Application instructions, The Group is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. The Group is required to calculate ECL on its non-performing financial assets as higher of provision under Prudential Regulations (PR) and ECL under IFRS 9.

For Stage 3, The Group calculates the ECL against corporate, commercial & SME loan portfolios as higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level, whereas against the retail borrowers The Group calculates the ECL at higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at segment/product basis as instructed under Annexure-A of BPRD Circular no 16 of 2024.

ECL is the probability weighted estimate of expected cash shortfalls which is determined by multiplying the probability of default (PD) with the loss given default (LGD) with the expected exposure at the time of default (EAD). Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 and Application Instructions, The Group has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

---

## Chunk 394

# – Probability of default (PD):

The Probability of Default represents the likelihood that a counterparty will default within a specific timeframe, such as 12 months (12-month ECL for Stage 1) or the lifetime of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL for Stage 2). The Group calculates PD on advances which is further bifurcated into retail and non retail portfolios. Following is the methodology through which non retail and retail PD are calculated:

---

## Chunk 395

# – Non-Retail PD:

The Group utilizes its internal risk rating system to assign Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) to borrowers. The Group has used a statistical method called Markov Chain, also known as Transition Matrices/Migration matrices, for the estimation of TTC PDs associated with each of its Obligor Risk Rating (ORR).

---

## Chunk 396

# – Retail PD:

The Group has used market benchmark PDs for retail segments. The Group has recently started developing its retail portfolio and does not have sufficient data to develop PD and LGD Models. In the absence of required data and after discussing with consultants, management has decided to use the market benchmark PDs and BASEL prescribed 45% LGD for retail segment. Moreover, the Group has used its internal data to develop the TTC- PD models using Pluto and Tasche technique for the calculation of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) on Investments, Balances with other banks (BWOB) and Lending to FIs. TTC-PD were converted into PiT PDs by applying Macro Economic variable with Vasicek approach.

---

## Chunk 397

# Incorporation of forward-looking information:

Forward looking information is incorporated to convert TTC PD to Point in Time Probability of Default (PiT) PD. The Group has estimated the PiT PDs using the Vasicek framework in its PD Model. For this purpose, The Group incorporated 5-year forecasts obtained from the Macro Economic Variable (MEV) database of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The MEVs used in the Model are the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) etc.

---

## Chunk 398

# Exposure at Default (EAD):

The Group has defined EAD for financial assets carried at an amortised cost equal to principal plus accrued markup at the default date. Each repayment date is assumed to be a default point in the model, and the ECL is calculated on the EAD at each repayment date and discounted at the effective interest rate to arrive at the discounted ECL under three scenarios, i.e, base, worst, and best-case scenarios. The unutilized exposures are multiplied with Credit Conversion Factors (CCFs) to compute the EAD of revolving facilities. For non revolving facilities, CCF is only applied to unutilized exposures when The Group doesn’t have unconditional right to revoke the undrawn portion. Additionally, cash and cash equivalent collateral The Group holds against non-retail facilities are adjusted from the EAD, and ECL is calculated on the net amount. The Group has developed CCF models for its revolving and non revolving facilities based on the historical utilization of credit limits which are currently being applied to the revolving portfolio.

---

## Chunk 399

# Loss Given Default:

Loss Given Default (LGD) represents the forecasted economic loss in the event of default, calculated independently of credit quality and applied consistently across all stages. LGD is determined as the percentage of loss expected in case of borrower default, incorporating historical data, cash recovery experience (including settlements), costs and time of recoveries, collateral realizations, and recovery projections. For non-collateralized portfolios, The Group estimates LGD based on actual recoveries from defaulted accounts over a historical period of 8 years prior to the assessment date. Forward-looking information is incorporated into the LGD calculation to reflect the impact of macroeconomic factors on the expected recoveries. The Group uses a statistical approach, specifically the Jacob Frye model, to estimate Point-in-Time (PiT) LGD. This model accounts for forward-looking information, including macroeconomic variables, to estimate LGD for all credit segments.

---

## Chunk 400

# Purchase or Originated Credit Impaired Financial Assets

Purchase or Originated Credit Impaired (POCI) financial assets are assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition. Expected credit loss for these assets is not recognised in a separate loss provision on initial recognition, as the lifetime expected credit loss is inherent within the gross carrying amount of the instruments. Consequently, POCI assets do not carry an impairment allowance on initial recognition. The amount recognised as a loss allowance after initial recognition is equal to the changes in lifetime ECL since the initial recognition of the asset.

---

## Chunk 401

# Presentation of allowance for Expected Credit Loss in the Statement of Financial Position

Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as follows:

- financial assets measured at amortised cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets.
- loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: as a provision in Other Assets / Liabilities.

- where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and The Group does not identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component and instead presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision; and

- debt instruments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance is recognised in the statement of financial position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance is disclosed and is recognised in retained earnings.

---

## Chunk 402

# 4.1.2.12 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Group used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or markup payments are 60 & 120 days past due for advances and trade bills respectively. Qualitative factors include the Watchlist and restructured/rescheduled.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PR issued by SBP. Financial assets in stage 2 may be reclassified to stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum period of 06 months from the end of downgrade reason is required before any facility is moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to move back from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it should meet the criteria defined under the respective Prudential Regulations for de-classification of account / facility and after observing of 03 months cooling off period. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022. However, banks are free to choose more stringent days past due criteria.

---

## Chunk 403

# 4.1.2.13 Write-offs

Financial assets are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when The Group determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level.

Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in the statement of profit and loss account and OCI.

Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with The Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

---

## Chunk 404

# 4.1.2.14 Off-setting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, The Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

---

## Chunk 405

# 4.1.2.15 Undrawn loan commitments and guarantees

Financial guarantees are contracts that require The Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Loan commitments are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions.

When estimating lifetime ECL for undrawn loan commitments, The Group estimates the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the loans are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

---

## Chunk 406

# 4.1.2.16 Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Group has adopted a governance framework requiring the Risk, Finance, Operations, Internal Audit and IT functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. IFRS 9 requires robust credit risk models that can predict Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD).

The Group’s Risk Management Division has developed Models/methodologies for PD, LGD and Credit Conversion Factors (CCF). These models are validated on an annual basis considering the following aspects:

- Quantitative Validation: Expected credit loss (ECL) model design validation, data quality validation and benchmarking with external best practices.
- Quantitative Validation: Calibration testing which ensures the accuracy of the observed PDs.

The Risk Department defines the staging criteria for the new impairment model and takes ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach. Additionally, the Risk department also takes ownership of the impact of ECL on the bank's capital.

Risk Management division of the Group is responsible for the implementation of IFRS 9. Further, the Group has engaged a consultant for the calculation of ECL on a quarterly basis. The same is provided to the Risk Management Division which reviews and assesses the ECL and submits it to the Finance Division for financial reporting requirements.

Finance Division then uses the financial information for preparing the financial statements and related financial ratios.

Risk Management Division prepares and submits the analysis to the board risk committee on a quarterly basis. Further, financial statements prepared on the basis of IFRS-9 are then submitted to the Board Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.

The IT Department provides support to all the stakeholders for preparing and extracting the data required for the risk parameters modelling. The IT department also provides support to project owners for system development and upgrades.

# 4.2 Cash and cash equivalents

For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks and national prize bonds less overdrawn nostro balances.

# 4.3 Lendings to / borrowings from financial institutions

The Group enters into transactions of borrowing (repo) from and lending (reverse repo) to financial institutions, at contracted rates for a specified period of time. These are recorded as under:

---

## Chunk 407

# Purchase under resale agreement (reverse repo)

Securities purchased with a corresponding commitment to resell at a specified future date (reverse repos) are not recognised in these consolidated statement of financial position and instead amounts paid under these arrangements are included in lendings to financial institutions. The difference between purchase and resale price is accrued as markup income on a pro-rata over the term of the agreement.

---

## Chunk 408

# Sale under repurchase agreement (repo)

Securities sold with a simultaneous commitment to repurchase at a specified future date (repos) continue to be recognised in these consolidated statement of financial position and are measured in accordance with accounting policies for investments and amount received under these agreements are recorded as repurchase agreement borrowings. The difference between sale and repurchase price is accrued as markup expense on a pro-rata basis over the term of the repo agreement.

---

## Chunk 409

# Bai muajjal

In Bai Muajjal, The Group sells sukuk on credit to other financial institutions. The sale / purchase price is agreed at the time of sale and such proceeds are received at the end of the credit agreed period. The sukuk sold under bai muajjal transaction are derecognised on the date of disposal. Receivable against such sale is recognised at the agreed sale price. The difference between the sale price and the carrying value on the date of disposal is taken to income on straight line basis.

# Musharaka / Modaraba

In Musharaka / Modaraba, The Group invests in the Shariah compliant business pools of the financial institutions at the agreed profit sharing ratio. Loss, if any will be shared between the parties as per the investment.

---

## Chunk 410

# Musharaka from the SBP under Islamic Export Refinance Scheme (IERS)

Under IERS, The Group accepts funds from the SBP under Shirkat-ul-aqd to constitute a pool for investment in islamic export refinance portfolio of The Group under the guidelines issued by the SBP. The profit of the pool is shared as per the agreed weightages between the partners.

---

## Chunk 411

# Modaraba investment from the SBP under various long term Islamic refinance schemes

Under various long term Islamic refinance schemes of the SBP, The Group accepts funds from the SBP which are received on Modaraba basis for investment in the pool of The Group. The profit of the pool is shared as per the agreed profit sharing ratio of the pool and the weightages assigned to these investments.

---

## Chunk 412

# Certificates of Investment (Musharakah)

Certificates of Investment (COI's) are carried at principal amount in these consolidated financial statements. FHM and HMM invest the amount received from COI holders on the basis of full participation in the profit and loss. The profit is allocated between COI holders and certificate holders as per agreed ratio. Certificate holder's share of profit is recognised as financial expense in the period of its occurrence. On the basis of projected rate of profit, profit on musharakah finance.

# 4.4  Investments (Applicable before 01 January 2024)

# 4.4.1   Investments in subsidiaries

are stated at cost less provision for impairment, if any.

---

## Chunk 413

# 4.4.2   Other investments are classified as follows:

- Held-for-trading
These are securities, which are either acquired for generating profit from short-term fluctuation in market prices, interest rate movements, dealers margin or are securities included in a portfolio in which a pattern of short-term trading exists.

Property and equipment are stated at cost, except for land and buildings which are carried at revalued amount, less any applicable accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Land and buildings are stated at revalued amount less accumulated depreciation (in case of buildings) and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset at the rates specified in note 11.2 to these consolidated financial statements. Depreciation on additions during the year is calculated from the date of addition. In case of disposals during the year, the depreciation is charged till the date of disposal.

Subsequent cost are included in the asset's carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to The Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the consolidated profit and loss account.

An item of property and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is recognised in the profit and loss account in the year the asset is derecognised.

The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed and changes, if any, are treated as change in accounting estimates, at each statement of financial position date.

Land and buildings are revalued by independent professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. If an asset’s carrying value increases as a result of revaluation, such increase or surplus arising on revaluation is credited to the surplus on revaluation of property and equipment account. If an asset’s carrying amount is decreased as a result of a revaluation, the decrease shall be recognised in the consolidated profit or loss account. However, if the increase reverses a deficit on the same asset previously recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account, such an increase is also recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account to the extent of the previous deficit and thereafter in the surplus on the revaluation of property and equipment account.

In the case of revalued assets, any accumulated depreciation on the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the net asset and the net amount restated at the revalued amount of the asset.

Surplus on revaluation of property and equipment (net of any associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit.

Surplus on revaluation (net of any deferred tax) realized on disposal of land and building is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at amount equal to present value of lease liability, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight line method from the commencement date to the earlier of end of the useful life of right-of-use asset or end of the lease term.

---

## Chunk 429

# 4.7 Intangible assets

These are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any. The cost of intangible assets are amortised from the month when the assets are available for intended use, using the straight line method, whereby the cost of the intangible asset is amortised over its estimated useful life over which economic benefits are expected to flow to The Group. The useful life and amortisation method is reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each consolidated statement of financial position date.

---

## Chunk 430

# 4.8 Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are initially recorded at cost and subsequently carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. These assets are revalued by professionally qualified valuators with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value.

Legal fees, transfer costs and direct costs of acquiring title to property is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account. Depreciation on assets (other than land) acquired in satisfaction of claims is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account on the same basis as depreciation charged on The Group's property and equipment. If the recognition of such assets results in a reduction in non-performing loans, such reductions and the corresponding reductions in provisions held against non-performing loans are disclosed separately. These assets are generally intended for sale. Gains and losses realised on the sale of such assets are disclosed separately from gains and losses realised on the sale of property and equipment. Surplus on revaluation (net of deferred tax) realised on disposal of these assets is transferred directly to unappropriated profit. If such an asset is subsequently used by The Group for its own operations, the asset is transferred to property and equipment along with any related surplus.

34.1 Income tax assessments of the Group have been finalised up to the tax year 2024 (corresponding to the accounting year ended 31 December 2023). Certain appeals are pending with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Appeal) and Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR). However, adequate provisions are being held by the Group.

34.2 This reflects provision made, on prudent basis, for additional tax imposed by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) through its notification dated 21 November 2023 on the foreign exchange income of the banking sector at the rate of 40% for the financial year ended 31 Dec 2021 and 31 Dec 2022. The Group has challenged the imposition of additional tax before the Sindh High Court which has granted stay against such demand. The matter is currently pending for final adjudication.

# 38.10 Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analysis has been performed by varying one assumption keeping all other assumptions constant and calculating the impact on the present value of the defined benefit obligations under the various employee benefit schemes. The increase / (decrease) in the present value of defined benefit obligations as a result of change in each assumption is summarized below:

|2024|2024|
|---|---|
|Rupees in ‘000| |
|1 % increase in discount rate|2,475,531|
|1 % decrease in discount rate|2,879,359|
|1% increase in expected future increment in salary|2,882,419|
|1% decrease in expected future increment in salary|2,469,415|
|10% increase in expected withdrawal rate|2,608,244|
|10% decrease in expected withdrawal rate|2,609,137|
|1% increase in expected mortality rate|2,609,813|
|1% decrease in expected mortality rate|2,607,804|

Although the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of expected cash flows, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.

# 38.14 Funding Policy

The Group has the policy to make annual contributions to the fund based on actuarial report.

---

## Chunk 541

# 38.15 Significant risk associated with the staff retirement benefit schemes include:

Asset volatility The risk of the investment underperforming and being not sufficient to meet the liabilities. The duration of the liabilities is 9.6 Years. Based on the weighted average duration of this plan and guidance from Pakistan Society of Actuaries (“PSOA”), the discount rate used for the calculations is 16.00% per annum.

Inflation risk The risk that the final salary at the time of cessation of service is greater than what we assumed. Since the benefit is calculated on the final salary (which will closely reflect inflation and other macroeconomic factors), the benefit amount increases as salary increases.

Mortality rate The risk that the actual mortality experience is different than the assumed mortality. This effect is more pronounced in schemes where the age and service distribution is on the higher side.

Withdrawal rate The risk of actual withdrawals experience is different from assumed withdrawal probability. The significance of the withdrawal risk varies with the age, service and the entitled benefits of the beneficiary.

# 41. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than investment those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price.

Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

The fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings are frequently repriced.

---

## Chunk 551

# 41.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

Federal government debt securities: The fair value of government securities are valued using PKRV, PKFRV, PKISRV and PSX rates.

Debt securities other than federal government securities: The fair value is determined using the prices / rates available on Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) / Reuters website and PSX.

Forward contracts: The fair values are derived using forward exchange rates applicable to their respective remaining maturities.

Mutual funds: The fair value is determined based on the net asset values published at the close of each business day.

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values of non-financial assets within level 2

Property and equipment and non-banking assets are valued by professionally qualified valuators. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. In determining the valuation for land and building the valuer refers to numerous independent market inquiries from local estate agents / realtors in the vicinity to establish the present market value. The fair valuation of land and building are considered to represent a level 2 valuation based on significant non-observable inputs being the location and condition of the assets.

The fair value is subject to change owing to changes in input. However, management does not expect there to be a material sensitivity to the fair value arising from the non-observable inputs.

# 46. RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk management aspects are embedded in the holding company’s strategy, organization structure and processes. The holding company has adopted a cohesive risk management structure for credit, market, liquidity and operational risk with an integrated approach to strengthen the process and system as controls are more effective and valuable when built into the process. Effective risk management is considered essential in the preservation of the assets and long-term profitability of the holding company. Clear guidelines and limits, which are under regular review, are backed by a system of internal controls and independent audit inspections. Internal reporting / MIS are additional tools for measuring and controlling risks. Separation of duties is also embedded in the holding company’s system and organization.

## Chunk 569

# 46.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counterparty in a transaction may default. It arises principally in relation to the lending and trade finance business carried out by the holding company.

As per Basel II methodology the gross credit risk weighted exposure incorporating relevant credit conversion factor is Rs. 474,510,547 thousand (2023: Rs. 428,865,561 thousand) as depicted in note 42.

The Group’s strategy is to minimize credit risk through a strong pre-disbursement credit analysis, approval and risk measurement process added with product, geography and customer diversification. The holding company, as its strategic preference, extends trade and working capital financing, so as to keep the major portion of exposure (funded and non-funded) on a short-term, self-liquidating basis. Major portion of the holding company's credit portfolio is priced on flexible basis with pricing reviewed on periodic basis.

With the expansion of the Consumer lending portfolio, the Credit Review & Administration efforts have been accordingly enhanced by inducting specialized consumer credit risk analysts and processing specialists.

Centralized Credit and Trade processing centres staffed with experienced resource provide strength to post-disbursement aspect of credit risk management.

The Group’s credit policy / manual defines the credit extension criteria, the credit approval and monitoring process, the loan classification system and provisioning policy.

The Group continually assesses and monitors credit exposures. The group follows both objective and subjective criteria of SBP regarding loans classification. The subjective assessment process is based on management's judgement with respect to the borrower's character, activity, cash flow, capital structure, security, quality of management and delinquency.

The Group uses the 'Standardised Approach' in calculation of credit risk and capital requirements.

The Group uses reputable and the SBP approved rating agencies for deriving risk weight to specific credit exposures. These are applied consistently across the Group credit portfolio for both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. The methodology applied for using External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAI's) inclusive of the alignment of alpha numeric scale of each agency used with risk bucket is as per the SBP guidelines as is given below:

The forms of collateral that are deemed eligible under the ‘Simple Approach’ to credit risk mitigation as per the SBP guidelines are used by the Group and primarily includes cash, government, equity investment in blue chip companies and rated debt securities. The Group applies the SBP specified haircut to collateral for credit risk mitigation. Collateral management is embedded in the Group’s risk taking and risk management policy and procedures. A standard credit granting procedure exists which has been well-disseminated down the line, ensuring proper pre-sanction evaluation, adequacy of security, pre-examination of charge / control documents and monitoring of each exposure on an ongoing basis. Collateral information is recorded diligently in the Group's main processing systems by type of collateral, amount of collateral against relevant credit exposures. A cohesive accounting / risk management system facilitates effective collateral management for Basel II reporting.

# 46.1.7 Incorporation of forward-looking information in ECL

The assessment of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculation incorporates forward looking information. Forward-looking aspect introduces an extra dimension, which is often captured by relating expected losses to the macro-economic variables. The incorporation of macroeconomic factors increases the accuracy of the results produced and makes it more reliable to predict estimate future results more accurately.

The Group uses historic and forecasted data to determine the impact of macroeconomic factors to estimate Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) etc. Further, statistical models based on historical correlation is performed to identify most significant macro-economic variable(s) that have been recognised as contributors to the default performance of the portfolio. The macro-economic variables (including KSE 100 Index, Consumer Price Index and Crude Oil Price) used in the ECL calculation are fetched from the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) database and the relevant macro-economic variables are selected based on sensitivity of each of the portfolios to specific macro-economic variables. Three macroeconomic scenarios have been developed base, best, and worst with assigned scenario probability weightings of 70%, 15%, and 15% respectively.

# 46.1.8 Sensitivity of ECL to future economic conditions

The Group conducted a sensitivity analysis on macro-economic indicators which are utilized for forward-looking calculations. As of December 31, 2024, when the macro-economic indicators in the base scenario was adjusted upwards or downwards by 10%, the ECL showed the following variation:

|Segment|Upwards|Downwards|
|---|---|---|
|Corporate|-9.59%|15.34%|
|SME|-5.69%|8.64%|
|Agriculture|-30.93%|37.05%|

The ECL are sensitive to judgements and assumption made regarding formulation of forward-looking scenarios and how much such scenarios are incorporated into calculations. The Group performs sensitivity analysis on the ECL recognised on each of its segments.

The table below shows the loss allowance on each segment assuming each forward-looking scenario (e.g. Base, worst and best) were weighted 100% instead of applying scenario probability across the three scenarios.

|Segment|Total ECL as per FS|Total ECL after sensitivity analysis|Increase / decrease in %|Total ECL after sensitivity analysis|Increase / decrease in %|Total ECL after sensitivity analysis|Increase / decrease in %|

# 46.2 Market risk

Market Risk is the risk of loss in earnings and capital due to adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices as well as their correlations and volatilities. Market Risk performs risk measurement, monitoring, and control functions through the use of various risk procedures and tools.

The Holding Company has a comprehensive Board approved market risk management policy wherein the governance structure for managing market risk, methods to control market risk, measurement tools used, the market risk exposure limits and the tolerance levels have been addressed. The holding company's strategy for managing market risk is to relate the level of risk exposures to their risk appetite and the capital base. This structure is reviewed, adjusted and approved periodically.

The Board of Directors oversees the holding company's strategy for market risk exposures. The Bank’s Market Risk Management governance structure consists of the Risk & Compliance Committee (BR&CC) of the Board, Investment Committee and Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) and is assisted by the independent Market Risk function with reporting line to the Risk Management Division.

The asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) which comprises senior management oversees the financial position of the holding company, assesses the impact of the interest rate change on the holding company's investment portfolio through sensitivity analysis, duration and performs an oversight function to ensure sound asset quality, liquidity and pricing considering the current interest rate environment. The investment policy amongst other aspects covers the holding company asset allocation guidelines.

Market Risk function seeks to facilitate efficient risk/return management decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance and provide transparency into the Bank’s market risk profile for senior management, the Board of Directors, and regulators. In line with the regulatory requirements, the holding company performs the impact of changes in the market factors on the holding company’s earnings through regular stress testing and Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Processes.

# 46.2.2 Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk is the probability of loss resulting from adverse movement in exchange rates. The holding company’s business model for foreign exchange risk is to serve trading activities of its clients in an efficient and cost effective manner. The holding company is not in the business of actively trading and market making activities and all FX exposures are backed by customer's trade transaction. A conservative risk approach backed by holding company’s business strategy to work with export oriented clients gives the ability to meet its foreign exchange needs.

# 8. Deduction of Withholding Tax from Dividend

The Government of Pakistan through Finance Act, 2020 has made certain amendments in section 150 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 whereby different rates prescribed for deduction of withholding tax on the amount of dividend paid by the companies. These tax rates are as under:

- (a) For filers of income tax returns: 15%
- (b) For non-filers of income tax returns: 30%

To enable the Bank to make tax deduction on the amount of cash dividend @ 15% instead of 30%, all shareholders whose names are not entered in the Active Tax-Payers List (ATL) provided on the website of Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), despite the fact that they are filers, are advised to make sure that their names are entered into ATL at the earliest possible otherwise tax on their cash dividend (as and when declared) will be deducted @ 30%.

For shareholders holding their shares jointly as per the clarification issued by the FBR withholding tax will be determined separately on 'Filer/Non-Filer' status of Principal Shareholder as well as joint-holder(s) based on their shareholding proportions. Therefore, all shareholders who hold shares jointly are required to provide shareholding proportions of Principal Shareholder and Joint-holder(s) in respect of shares held by them follows:

|Folio / CDC Account No.|Total Shares| |Principal Shareholder| |Joint Shareholder(s)| |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | |Name and CNIC No.|Shareholding Proportion|Name and CNIC No.|Shareholding Proportion|
| | | | |(No. of Shares)| |(No. of Shares)|

In case of non-receipt of above information, the shareholding will be divided among the joint-holders equally.
