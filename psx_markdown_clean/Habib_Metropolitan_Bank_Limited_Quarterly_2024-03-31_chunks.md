These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. The accounting and reporting standards for interim financial reporting comprise of:

- International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;

The disclosures and presentation made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements are based on a format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 2 dated 09 February 2023 and IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. They do not include all the disclosures required for annual financial statements, and these consolidated condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2023.

## Chunk 11

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The significant accounting policies and method of computation adopted in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2023, except for the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments w.e.f 01 January 2024.

---

## Chunk 12

# 3.1 Amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become effective in the current period

# 3.1.1 Impact of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of accounting for financial liabilities. To determine appropriate classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments to be assessed based on combination of the entity's business model for managing the assets and the instruments' contractual cash flow characteristics. The adoption of IFRS 9 has also fundamentally changed the impairment method of financial assets with a forward-looking Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach.

As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group has opted for modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were adjusted from general provision held by the Group without restating the comparative financial information.

---

## Chunk 13

# 3.1.2 Reconciliation of statement of financial position balances from existing local regulations to IFRS 9

The following table reconciles the carrying amounts of financial assets, from their previous measurement category in accordance with existing local regulations to their new measurement categories upon transition to IFRS 9 on 01 January 2024.

Under the Workers' Welfare Ordinance 1971, the Bank is liable to pay workers' welfare fund (WWF) @ 2% of accounting profit before tax or taxable income, whichever is higher. The Bank has made full provision for WWF based on profit for the respective years.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated 10 November 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of WWF were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending. Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions the judgement may not currently be treated as conclusive. Accordingly the Bank maintains its provision in respect of WWF.

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values of non-financial assets within level 3.

Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claim Fixed assets and non-banking assets are valued by professionally qualified valuators. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. In determining the valuation for land and building the valuer refers to numerous independent market inquiries from local estate agents / realtors in the vicinity to establish the present market value. The fair valuation of land and building are considered to represent a level 3 valuation based on significant non-observable inputs being the location and condition of the assets. The fair value is subject to change owing to changes in input. However, management does not expect there to be a material sensitivity to the fair value arising from the non-observable inputs.
