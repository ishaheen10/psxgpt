# CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW REPORT

I am pleased to present, on behalf of the Board of Directors, the Annual Report of JS Bank Limited for the year ended December 31, 2024.

JS Bank’s consistent performance in Pakistan’s dynamic financial landscape is a reflection of key strategic initiatives considered by the Bank over the course of its journey. Our mission remains clear – to empower people, support businesses, and drive economic and social progress. By embracing cutting-edge technology, we continue to offer seamless banking experiences to our customers, prioritizing the needs and expectations of our clients, and providing tailored solutions that foster long-term relationships. We remain committed to environmentally and socially responsible banking practices, with a vision to contribute to the broader economic development of Pakistan.

As a tech-savvy mid-sized bank with a diversified portfolio of products, we take pride in our capabilities. The organization is well-structured and supported by a young, resilient, and highly skilled team that is determined to achieve the Bank’s strategic objectives efficiently and effectively. We have established clear systems and processes that support operations and drive our growth.

During the year 2024, the Bank delivered sound financial performance, and achieved the milestone of crossing PKR 500 billion in Deposits, which was a landmark achievement in the history of the Bank. On a consolidated basis, the Bank continues to remain over PKR 1 trillion in terms of overall deposits. We added 25 new branches to our network this year, expanding our outreach across the country. Our digital banking platform ‘Zindigi’ solidified its leadership in Pakistan’s digital banking sector in 2024 with several key developments, as we crossed 5 million users this year.

The company expanded its lending products with Advance Salary+, offering flexible financing for salaried individuals. The new app design, Zindigi 2.0, won the “Best Mobile App” award at the Pakistan Digital Awards, reinforcing Zindigi’s commitment to sustainable growth and innovation.

The Bank remains committed to digital transformation, delivering over 100 innovations. More than 80% of our customers now use at least one digital service, and the shift toward paperless processing enhances efficiency and reduces costs.

In 2024, JS Bank was recognized as a leader in innovation, sustainability, and corporate responsibility, receiving prestigious accolades on both national and international platforms. Key highlights include being awarded Best Digital App for Zindigi and Best Content Marketing for JS Her at the Pakistan Digital Awards, showcasing our dedication to leveraging technology to empower customers. On the global stage, JS Bank was named the Fastest Growing Private Bank in Pakistan and the Fastest Growing Corporate Bank in Pakistan for 2024. We were also recognized for Best Renewable Energy Financing at the Global Banking & Finance Awards, affirming our leadership in driving financial and environmental sustainability.

Further demonstrating our holistic approach, JS Bank was honored with the Digital Transformation Bank of the Year and Health & Wellness Bank of the Year awards by Asian Banking & Finance. Additionally, we received the Workplace Wellness Programme Award from ESG Business, emphasizing our focus on employee well-being and innovation.

As a Bank, our focus remains on inclusivity, and this year we expanded on our initiatives to support underrepresented groups. Through our JS Inclusive Account, we are breaking barriers for differently abled individuals, while the JS Her Account aims to equip women entrepreneurs with resources to transform their businesses and communities. We also partnered with organizations such as UNDP and Inspiring Women Pakistan to deliver financial training and support gender-inclusive, climate-resilient businesses to create long-term impact. Our commitment to inclusivity and governance earned us the Progressive Category Award from the Global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Benchmarks. At the same time, the title of Financial Literacy Champion Bank from

The State Bank of Pakistan highlighted our role in advancing financial education nationwide. Furthermore, JS Bank was recognized as the Best Clearing Agent for 2024 by JP Morgan and awarded the Leading Digital Bank Award by CxO, further solidifying our position as a trailblazer in digital banking.

All these accolades are not just testimony to our achievements, but also reaffirm our responsibility to set new benchmarks in the banking industry. Through continued innovation and adherence to enhanced governance, JS Bank will continue on its journey to create greater value for its customers, partners, and the communities that we serve, through delivering transformative banking solutions and fostering meaningful societal impacts.

I am also pleased to share that the Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) upgraded the long-term rating of JS Bank Limited (JSBL) to ‘AA’ (Double A) in 2024, while the short-term entity rating was maintained at ‘A1+’ (A One Plus) which is the highest in this category. These ratings reflect JS Bank’s strong financial performance, robust risk management practices, and commitment to excellence in the banking sector, further enabling us to innovate, empower and drive greater value for our customers and the economy.

JS Bank acknowledges the significant responsibility that comes with its position in the banking and corporate sectors. As a committed corporate citizen, the Bank focuses on making meaningful contributions to society through its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. JS Bank aims to support its customers and the communities it serves to create positive change. Effective governance plays a pivotal role in guiding the business to execute strategies while maintaining a balance between sustainable shareholder value and adherence to regulatory requirements.

Ensuring good corporate governance through ethical and professional business conduct as well as effective risk and audit management are key foundation blocks for us. JS Bank has always been committed to sustainable value creation for all of its stakeholders with high standards of corporate governance through a comprehensive system of internal controls. The Board of JS Bank follows comprehensive criteria for its performance evaluation and continually reviews the Bank’s financial & operational soundness and significant policies in line with regulatory requirements. The Board has constituted sub-committees for the oversight of all key areas of the Bank, covering risk management, audit-related matters, information technology, and human resources for achieving the Bank’s strategic objectives. In its pursuit of transparency and accountability, the Board has engaged Grant Thornton Anjum Rahman (GT) to perform an annual evaluation of its members and committees and their performance.

I am confident that with our leading value-added offerings, emphasis on customer satisfaction, dedication towards excellent service quality, and focus on innovation and convenience, we are committed in our determination to strive for excellence and deliver to our stakeholders.

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank the Ministry of Finance, the State Bank of Pakistan, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, and the Federal Board of Revenue for their continuous support and guidance. I would also like to thank our shareholders for their continued commitment and confidence in our long-term strategic vision, as well as our management and staff for their commitment and hard work for the greater progress and prosperity of our Bank.

Sincerely,
Adil Matcheswala

## Chunk 7

# Economic review

With stable major macroeconomic indicators driven by ongoing government regulatory initiatives and structural reforms, CY24 was a breakthrough year for Pakistan’s economy. Pakistan received a final tranche of US$1.1 billion under IMF’s Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in March 2024. Subsequently, Pakistan got IMF Executive Board approval for the 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for SDR 5.32 billion (~US$7 billion) in Sep-2024, with immediate disbursement of SDR 760 million (~US$1 billion). Furthermore, during the year, both Moody’s and Fitch upgraded Pakistan’s credit ratings.

The Current Account has been posting consecutive surpluses since Oct-2024, taking 1HFY25 CA balance to US$1,210 million, primarily driven by higher remittances and controlled trade deficit. Combined with a positive Current account, the stable Capital account helped the Balance of Payments (BoP) remain in positive territory for 1HFY25, despite loan repayments.

With a stable currency, comfortable CAD levels, and support from development and bilateral lenders, State Bank foreign exchange reserves managed to reach ~US$12 billion as of Dec-2024 compared to US$8.2 billion in Dec-2023. Resultantly Pakistan’s import cover improved from 1.9x in Dec-2023 to 2.8x in Dec-2024. Meanwhile, Pak Rupee appreciated by 1 percent to PKR 278/US$ during the year.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) began monetary easing in June 2024 with a 150 percent cut in the policy rate, followed by multiple consecutive rate cuts in following meetings, taking the rate down to 13 percent over the past 6 months from a high of 22 percent. This decision was supported by a continuous drop in CPI figures, where inflation dropped down to 4.1 percent in Dec-2024 compared to the levels close to 30 percent seen last year. This was primarily led by soft food product prices, stable currency, and a decline in international oil prices.

Pakistan would need sound policies and reforms to maintain macroeconomic stability, tackle structural challenges (e.g., tax system, energy sector, PSEs), and foster inclusive, resilient growth while reducing debt levels. The IMF has so far praised steps toward a fairer tax system and urged efforts to broaden the tax base, improve tax administration, and manage spending to enable investments in human capital, infrastructure, and social protection.

## Chunk 8

# Banking sector review

SBP continues monetary easing with a 9 percent decrease in the Policy Rate in around 6 months (22 percent to 13 percent). With CPI in a disinflation phase due to a high base, interest rates are also following. For Banks, this would mean a contraction of NIMs and ROEs, and an upside through higher volumetric growth is going to act as a buffer. However, as per recent changes to tax law close to the year end, banks are now required to pay an additional 5 percent tax on PBT regardless of whether they meet the ADR threshold. To recall, increased taxes on income attributable to Government Securities were to be applied to banks that failed to meet the ADR requirements previously set out. Notably, recent data indicated that industry’s ADR ratio has risen from 40 percent in June 2024 to approximately 50 percent. The purpose of the additional income tax based on ADR levels was to encourage banks to lend to businesses instead of depending on the government. Most banks were on track to adjust their lending books to avoid the tax before the year-end deadline, while the change to ADR tax law and imposition of additional 5 percent tax on Banks was enacted close to the Balance Sheet date.

Capital adequacy ratios in the sector remain strong, well above regulatory requirements. The slowdown in credit growth, along with higher investments in risk-free debt instruments, has led to an increase in risk-weighted assets.

# Performance of the Bank

The summarized financial position and operating results of the Bank for year ended December 31, 2024 are as follows:

|FINANCIAL POSITION|2024|2023|
|---|---|---|
|Advances – net|225,519|203,727|
|Investments – net|302,437|287,957|
|Total Assets|636,107|589,432|
|Deposits and other accounts|525,134|486,283|
|Shareholders’ Equity|43,707|40,322|

|FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE|2024|2023|
|---|---|---|
|Net Markup Income|27,313|22,409|
|Non Markup Income|11,340|12,205|
|Total Revenue|38,653|34,614|
|Non-Markup Expenses|27,574|23,291|
|Profit before provisions and taxation|11,079|11,322|
|Credit loss allowance and write offs|4,713|2,807|
|Profit before taxation|6,366|8,515|
|Profit after taxation|2,849|4,335|
|Earnings per share (Rupees)|1.39|2.75|

For the year 2024, the Bank reported a Profit Before Tax of PKR 6,366.077 million (December 31, 2023: PKR 8,515.174 million). The Earnings Per Share (EPS) stands at PKR 1.39 (December 31, 2023: PKR 2.75).

The Bank recorded Net Interest Income (NII) of PKR 27,313 million in 2024 as compared to PKR 22,409 last year (up 22 percent). This growth in NII is primarily driven by higher interest rates than last year as well as deposit optimization. The Bank’s Non-Remunerative Deposit base increased from PKR 160,546 million in 2023 to PKR 198,409 million in 2024 (up 24 percent). This has also resulted in an improvement in the deposit mix, as the share of Non-Remunerative Deposits has increased from 33 percent last year to 38 percent in 2024. Gross Advances increased by 16 percent to PKR 247,714 million, as the Bank continued with its efforts towards meeting the year end Advances to Deposits Ratio target taking into consideration the previously enacted additional ADR tax measures. During the year, margins continued to remain under pressure, as secondary market yields continually adjusted in anticipation of rate cuts while funding costs remained stagnant for the first six months of the year due to unchanged minimum deposit rates (MDR). The impact of the rate cuts started to take effect towards the later half of the year, but at the same time, yields on offer continued to remain below the policy rate in continued anticipation of rate cuts.

The Bank’s Non-Markup Income reduced marginally by 7 percent YoY to PKR 11,340 million with 18 percent growth from Fee Income, growth in Dividend Income of 32 percent, as well as positive impact through net gains on securities of PKR 641 million year on year. Foreign Exchange income however, ended lower than last year by PKR 2,467 million due to relatively lower volatility in the FX markets as against last year, which offset the impact of the increase in other lines. Non mark-up Expenses increased by 18 percent YoY to PKR 27,574 million owing mainly due to inflationary adjustments, Rupee Depreciation and increase in technology based costs. The Bank’s Cost to Income Ratio increased marginally to 70.7 percent in 2024, while Net Interest Income to Operating Cost increased from 97 percent to 100 percent.

Year end Deposits were reported at PKR 525.134 billion. This translates to a growth of 8 percent against the December 31, 2023 position. As mentioned above, the Bank’s period end Non-Remunerative Deposits mix has improved to 38 percent. In terms of averages, the Bank’s average non-remunerative deposits improved from PKR 143.916 billion in year 2023 to PKR 165.927 billion in the year 2024.

With Gross Advances at a level of PKR 247.714 billion at December 31, 2024, the Bank’s Gross ADR level as at the period end inched up to 47 percent. The Bank’s Gross Infection Ratio also increased to 8.61 percent in December 2024 (December 2023: 7.6 percent), as non-performing loans increased to PKR 21.328 billion in December 2024 from PKR 16.184 billion in December 2023. With additional classifications considered this year, as well as charge considered against NPLs under IFRS 9, the Bank’s coverage ratio has improved to 71 percent (December 2023: 60 percent).

Our digital banking platform Zindigi has an exceptional year 2024, driven by innovation, customer focus, and strategic growth. The platform processed nearly PKR 250 billion worth of transactions, marking a significant increase compared to the previous year. The growth resulted in a 30 percent increase in revenue and a remarkable 66 percent rise in deposits. The year also saw several key developments and achievements. Notable launches included the Hajj Sullis Card—the first of its kind—in collaboration with MC and MYTM, a Freelance USD account, a mini-app platform, a split bill feature, and the first inclusive contactless payment solution, Raast P2M, under ‘Zindigi Pay.’ Additionally, a co-branded card was introduced under Banking as a Service (BaaS). Building on its AI-driven technologies, Zindigi expanded its lending product line with the introduction of Advance Salary+, a term loan designed to offer flexible financing options for salaried individuals. A groundbreaking new app design, Zindigi 2.0, was implemented to enhance user experience, and the app’s excellence was recognized when Zindigi won the “Best Mobile App” award at the prestigious Pakistan Digital Awards. Furthermore, the ‘Zindigi Prize,’ Pakistan’s first homegrown entrepreneurial community, expanded internationally to Kenya, making an impact beyond borders. Zindigi’s sustainable growth, customer-first philosophy, and commitment to innovation further solidified its position as a leader in Pakistan’s digital banking sector.

The Bank has also continued with its rapid expansion drive in the areas of digital transformation and Data Sciences – delivering over 100 new innovations. Uptake of digital channels in the bank has increased tremendously where over 80 percent of customers use at least one digital channel. Additionally, significant gains have been made in the bank’s drive towards paperless processing, thereby enhancing efficiency and rationalizing cost.

During the current year, the Bank made significant strides in expanding its RMA and enhancing its Global outreach. Our efforts have focused on strengthening relationships with International Financial Institutions and increasing our footprint in key markets. By forging new partnerships and entering emerging markets, we are positioning the Bank to capitalize on new growth opportunities and provide comprehensive financial solutions across borders. This global expansion not only strengthens our competitive edge but also aligns with our long-term strategy.

of delivering sustainable growth and value to shareholders. The Directors are confident that these initiatives will further bolster the Bank’s international presence and operational resilience, ensuring long-term success in the evolving global financial landscape.

In June 2024, The Pakistan Credit Rating Agency (PACRA) upgraded the long-term rating of the Bank to “AA” (Double AA) from AA- while maintaining the short-term rating at A1+ which is the highest in this category. These ratings reflect JS Bank’s strong financial performance, robust risk management practices, and commitment to excellence in the banking sector. PACRA’s “AA” rating signifies high credit quality, affirming JS Bank’s sound financial health and serving as a testament to the bank’s prudent financial policies, solid capitalization, and strategic foresight.

# Customer Experience and Fair Treatment

At JS Bank, our Customer Experience Team (CET) is dedicated to cultivating enduring customer relationships and consistently exceeding expectations across all interactions. This team spearheads our customer-centric philosophy, prioritizing effective grievance resolution and actively soliciting customer feedback to continuously improve the banking experience and deliver unparalleled service.

In 2024, the bank effectively addressed over 44,415 customer Complaints with an average resolution time of 3.2 business days. Our robust Complaint Handling Policy and transparent Grievance Redressal Mechanism are meticulously designed to ensure swift and efficient resolution of issues while proactively mitigating future occurrences. Recognizing the importance of accessibility and transparency, we offer multiple channels for customers to conveniently voice their concerns. Furthermore, customers retain the option of escalating their concerns to the Banking Mohtasib office should they be dissatisfied with the bank’s initial response.

To enhance the visibility of our complaint handling process, JS Bank strategically integrates awareness messages within various customer communication channels, including account statements, ATM screens, and official correspondence. To further augment accessibility to our redressal mechanisms, the bank actively disseminates information via social media platforms and SMS notifications to its valued customers. Our comprehensive website provides detailed information regarding the grievance procedure, available touchpoints, and convenient online feedback forms.

- Risk Management Committee (RMC)
- Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC)
- Central Credit Committee (CCC)
- IT Steering Committee (ITSC)
- Assets & Liabilities Committee (ALCO)

These Committees meet regularly to review market developments and the level of financial and security risk exposures of the Bank.

Risk Management plays a vital role in ensuring that an appropriate balance is maintained between risk and reward throughout the bank. Towards this end, the risk management function and framework have been modified in the year under review. The disciplines of risk management including market and liquidity, operational, BCP, portfolio, policy, agricultural credit, consumer and program lending, CAD, SAM, Digital, information security risks, and Green Banking Office, remain under the umbrella of the Chief Risk Officer.

Market Risk measurement, monitoring, and management reporting is done on a regular basis. The Market Risk & Basel Unit supported by the Treasury Middle Office is involved in the daily monitoring of all related financial risk exposures in the form of interest rate risk, equity exposure risk, currency or foreign exchange risk, cross border or country risk, financial institutions (FI) exposure risks, liquidity risk, and capital adequacy.

On the capital management side, the Bank’s practices ensure that it has reasonable capital to cover the risks associated with its activities. It is the prime objective of the Bank’s capital management to ensure that the bank complies with all regulatory capital requirements and at the same time maintains strong credit ratings and healthy capital ratios to support its business and maximize shareholders’ value.

Bank’s Operational Risk Management Framework ensures that adequate control environment exists to identify, address, and manage all operational risks and maintain an acceptable level of residual risks. Bank is focusing on embedding Risk and Control Self-Assessment for effective management of key risks and cultivating an environment where every employee understands his responsibility towards the management of operational risks.

Apart from the Risks and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA), Operational Loss Data (OLD) and Key Risk Indicators (KRI) exercise, the Operational Risk management function also maintains the Business Continuity Planning Policy and conducted numerous Business Continuity Drills to test availability of systems and services from the alternate sites.

Credit Risk management is an ongoing process. The overall credit policy and the credit risk management guidelines are approved by the Board of Directors. In this regard, a Central Credit Committee (CCC) is entrusted with the responsibility of monitoring and controlling credit risk in the Bank. CCC meets regularly to actively supervise credit risk across the lending portfolio. In order to maintain a healthy growth of the credit portfolio, the Bank’s Credit Risk Management processes are consistently upgraded and improved to meet future challenges. Further, in order to bolster credit risk management monitoring activities, a separate unit is in place for regular portfolio monitoring, formulating and implementing credit risk management tools, including setting up of industry, geographic and sectorial limits, and devising credit risk quantification / statistical techniques to meet SBP and Basel requirements. The health of the credit portfolio is being monitored through the Credit Administration, which is responsible for housekeeping elements along with the management of credit limits.

To identify and manage the inherent environmental and Social (E&S) risks in the Credit portfolio of the Bank, Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) procedures has been developed and effectively integrated in the in the Credit Risk Management process of the Bank, as stipulated in the Green Banking Policy and ESRM Framework of the Bank.

The Bank is conscious of risks and uncertainties associated with problem credits which require a different and more intense risk management approach. In this regard, a Special Asset Management Unit is in place following SBP’s regulatory guidelines to focus on remedial management issues, take ownership of classified portfolio for effective management and to determine the work-out modes for rehabilitation and settlements, as stipulated in the Remedial Management Policy of the Bank.

To further strengthen cybersecurity, the Bank is striving to build a process-oriented culture, bring maturity in tool utilization, and invest in IS staff to improve management / regulatory reporting and increase JS staff security awareness training.

To combat digital risks and to support the Digital Finance business, a dedicated team of risk experts has been established under the umbrella of Digital Risk. The prime objective of this function is to optimize policies, processes, and systems, investigate and mitigate digital frauds, data analytics to identify potential risks and augment business, and implement strategic plans.

## Chunk 14

# Statement on Internal Controls

The Bank places significant emphasis on establishing stringent controls throughout all its operations. This focus is a key component of the Bank’s policies, which are designed to adhere to the best industry practices, ethical standards, and regulatory requirements. In this regard, the Board of Directors has implemented policies that assess the overall effectiveness of the internal control environment.

Internal controls at JS Bank are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the Bank’s operations, the reliability of financial information, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, it is important to recognize that these systems can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatements or losses, as they are intended to manage risks rather than eliminate them completely.

To effectively manage risk, the governance structure of the Bank’s internal control functions consists of three levels of defense. The first line of defense is the business itself, which owns and manages its operational risks. The second line of defense involves oversight from Risk Management, Compliance, and control functions, which identify and assess risks impacting existing and new business initiatives, coordinate risk mitigation with specialists and businesses, and report these risks to the Risk Management Function for appropriate corrective measures.

The third line of defense is an independent and effective Internal Audit Function that reviews the effectiveness and adequacy of internal controls while monitoring compliance with policies and procedures.

The Board of Directors is regularly updated on compliance status through the Board Audit Committee. Management prioritizes all significant findings from internal and external auditors, as well as regulators, ensuring that appropriate corrective actions are taken. Adequate systems are in place to minimize breaches and prevent the repetition of mistakes, ultimately strengthening the control environment. Additionally, the Compliance Function actively ensures regulatory compliance across the Bank.

The Bank diligently follows the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Guidelines on Internal Control to evaluate the overall effectiveness of its internal controls, including financial reporting controls. Comprehensive documentation of bank-wide processes and controls has been completed.

Furthermore, the Bank has developed a robust management testing and reporting framework to ensure the effective operation of key controls and has addressed identified opportunities for design improvements.

Following the successful completion of the Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) Roadmap, the SBP granted the Bank an exemption in August 2016 from submitting a Long Form.

## Chunk 15

# Report (LFR) by external auditors

According to SBP directive BSD-1 Circular Letter No. 1 of July 6, 2021, banks that have completed all stages of the ICFR roadmap are allowed to discontinue the submission of the Annual Assessment Report on the efficacy of ICFR to the SBP. However, the SBP may still evaluate this report as part of supervisory assessments. As such, the Annual Assessment Report for December 31, 2024, regarding the efficacy of ICFR will be presented to the Board Audit Committee.

Management believes that the existing internal control system is adequate, effectively implemented, and continuously monitored. This view is also supported by the Board of Directors. The management is committed to enhancing its compliance with SBP guidelines on internal controls, thereby continuously strengthening its control environment.

# Review Report on the Statement of Compliance Contained in Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations; 2019

We have reviewed the enclosed Statement of Compliance with the Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019 (the Regulations) prepared by the Board of Directors of JS Bank Limited (the Bank) for the year ended 31 December 2024 in accordance with the requirements of Regulation No. 36 of the Regulations.

The responsibility for compliance with the Regulations is that of the Board of Directors of the Bank. Our responsibility is to review whether the Statement of Compliance reflects the status of the Bank's compliance with the provisions of the Regulations and report if it does not and to highlight any non-compliance with the requirements of the Regulations. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of the Bank's personnel and review of various documents prepared by the Bank to comply with the Regulations.

As a part of our audit of the financial statements we are required to obtain an understanding of the accounting and internal control systems sufficient to plan the audit and develop an effective audit approach. We are not required to consider whether the Board of Directors' statement on internal control covers all risks and controls or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of such internal controls, the Bank's corporate governance procedures and risks.

The Regulations require the Bank to place before the Audit Committee, and upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, place before the Board of Directors for their review and approval; its related party transactions. We are only required and have ensured compliance of this requirement to the extent of the approval of the related party transactions by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the Statement of Compliance does not appropriately reflect the Bank's compliance, in all material respects, with the requirements contained in the Regulations as applicable to the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2024.

# Following are the Key Audit Matters:

|S.No|Key Audit Matters|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|Valuation of Advances: (Refer note 9 & 20 to the unconsolidated financial statements)|As at 31 December 2024, the Bank's Credit loss allowance against advances and off-balance sheet items amounting to Rs. 15,778 million and Rs. 191 million respectively. As per the BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023, the Bank adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions issued by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) from 01 January 2024 which requires the Bank to recognize Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on advances including non-funded exposure. The estimation of ECL on advances including non-funded exposure, involves judgement and complexity. The key areas which are subject to management judgement in the estimation of ECL are: - Model estimations - judgmental modelling and assumption are used to estimate ECL which involves determining Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD). Respective model assumption is a key driver of complexity and uncertainty and are required in the application of these model for calculation of the ECL estimate.
- Economic scenarios - IFRS 9 requires the Bank to measure ECL on an unbiased forward-looking basis.
Our audit procedures, amongst others, included the following: - Performing risk assessment procedures over the credit loss allowance against advances and off-balance sheet exposure within the Bank's unconsolidated financial statement. As part of these risk assessment procedures, identifying the portfolios associated with a risk of material misstatement including those arising from judgements over the estimation of ECL either due to inputs, methods or assumption.
- Assessing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls established by the Bank over measurement of ECL and provision calculated as per PR.
- We involved in-house specialist who assisted in the following: - Evaluating the Bank's impairment methodologies for compliance with application instructions as issued by SBP for IFRS 9;
- Assessing the reasonableness of the Bank's methodology and models for determining the economic scenarios used and the probability weightings applied to them by independently validating and challenging the assumption, methodologies, and outputs of the models.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the unconsolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern; disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations; or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank's financial reporting process.

## Chunk 41

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of applicable assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

## Chunk 42

# KPMG Taseer Hadi & Co.

Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the unconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the unconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.

The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘expected credit losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions from January 01, 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at January 01, 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard. Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9.

SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 made amendments and extended the timelines of application instructions. Under the new guidelines, the banks are required to implement modification accounting for financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the Standard. These changes took effect from October 01, 2024, and have been applied retrospectively from January 01, 2024. SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 dated January 22, 2025, further clarified that modification accounting would be applied to loans modified on or after January 01, 2020.

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# 4.1.2.1.1

As per paragraph 3.2 of the Application Instructions, Government securities in local currency are exempted from the application of ECL framework, details are mentioned in note 4.1.2.12 to these unconsolidated financial statements.

---

## Chunk 67

# 4.1.2.1.2

Certain debt securities are held by the Bank in separate portfolios to meet everyday liquidity needs. The Bank seeks to minimise the costs of managing these liquidity needs and therefore actively manages the return on the portfolio. That return consists of collecting contractual payments as well as gains and losses from the sale of financial assets. The investment strategy often results in sales activity that is significant in value. The Bank considers that under IFRS 9 these securities are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.

---

## Chunk 68

# 4.1.2.1.3

These financial assets are held by overseas branch. As per paragraph 1.2 of the Application Instruction, in relation to overseas branch, IFRS 9 will be applicable based on their respective host country’s regulatory accounting practices. Since IFRS 9 was already applicable to overseas branches as at 01 January 2024, there is no impact of IFRS 9 adoption on these financial assets.

# 4.1.2.1.4

The Bank previously classified certain equity investments as Available-for-Sale (AFS). Upon implementing IFRS 9, the Bank made an irrevocable election to classify them at FVOCI.

---

## Chunk 69

# 4.1.2.1.5

Certain debt securities are held by the Bank in a separate portfolio for long-term yield. These securities may be sold, but such sales are not expected to be more than infrequent. The Bank considers that these securities are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect the contractual cash flows. These assets are classified as measured at amortised cost under IFRS 9.

# 4.1.2.1.6

This includes expected credit loss against off-balance sheet items.

---

## Chunk 70

# 4.1.2.2

Impact on regulatory capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the banks, which has reduced their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the 'Application Instructions' issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement.

The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the transitional adjustment amount) must be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the transition period of five years.

Moreover, SBP has allowed to adjust the amount of stage 1 and stage 2 provisions in Tier 2 Capital that have not been added back to CET 1 and vice versa as per Annexure-A of BPRD Circular No. 16 dated July 29, 2024.

Had IFRS 9 not been applied, the CAR would have been higher by 38 bps from 13.24% to 13.62%.

---

## Chunk 71

# 4.1.2.3

Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) regardless of the business model in which they are held.

---

## Chunk 72

# 4.1.2.3.1

Recognition and initial measurement

Debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. The fair value of a financial asset on initial recognition is generally its transaction price. If the Bank determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price.

Subsequently, that difference is recognized in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account on an appropriate basis over the life of the asset but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data, or the transaction is closed out.

Advances other than staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations are initially measured at transaction price i.e., the amount of loan disbursed at disbursement date.

Staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) loans and advances pertaining to overseas operations are recognized at fair value at the time of disbursement. The fair value is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using the prevailing market rates for instruments. The difference between the disbursed amount and the fair value at initial recognition is recorded as a prepayment.

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# 4.1.2.3.2  Classification

# (a)  Financial Assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset other than advances except for staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations is classified as measured at amortised cost, FVOCI or FVPL. A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held-for-trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Bank changes its business models for managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following changes in the business model. Advances are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, excluding staff loans, Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations, which are measured at amortized cost.

---

## Chunk 74

# (b)  Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), when they are held-for-trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognised in profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method. Markup expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit and loss. Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in scope of the standard are never bifurcated. Instead, the whole hybrid instrument is assessed for classification.

---

## Chunk 75

# 4.1.2.4    Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either held-to-collect, held-to-collect and sale and others based on Business Model Assessment. The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The assessment requires judgement based on facts and circumstances on the date of assessment. The information considered mainly includes:

- the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual markup revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Bank’s management;
- the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and its strategy for how those risks are managed;
- how managers of the business are compensated (e.g., whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected); and
- the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case' scenarios into account. Transfer of financial assets to third parties in transaction that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Bank continuing recognition of the financial assets. Financial assets that are held-for-trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVPL because they are neither held-to-collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# 4.1.2.5 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as interest margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Bank considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Bank considers:

- contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
- leverage features;
- prepayment and extension terms;
- terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and
- features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).

A prepayment feature is consistent with the SPPI criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and markup on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a discount or premium to its contractual par-amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.

The Bank holds a portfolio of long-term fixed-rate loan for which the Bank has the option to propose to revise the interest rate at periodic reset dates. These reset rights are limited to the market rate at the time of revision. The borrowers have an option to either accept the revised rate or redeem the financing at par without penalty. The Bank has determined that the contractual cash flows of these loan are SPPI because the option varies the interest rate in a way that is in consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic financing risks and costs associated with the principal amount outstanding.

---

## Chunk 77

# 4.1.2.6 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

- Financial assets at FVPL: These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any markup or dividend income, are recognised in profit and loss account.
- Financial assets at amortised cost: These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method in case of investments, lendings to financial institutions, cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks, Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), staff loans, and advances pertaining to overseas operations and other financial assets. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Markup, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.
- Debt investments at FVOCI: These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and is assessed for impairment under the new ECL model. Markup income is calculated using the effective interest method and includes amortisation of premiums and accretion of discount, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in income statement. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit and loss account.
- Equity investments at FVOCI: These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit and loss account unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are adjusted from the carrying value of investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit and loss account.
- Advances at cost: Advances are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, excluding staff loans, Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations, which are measured at amortized cost, net of expected credit loss allowances.

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# 4.1.2.7 Amortised cost and gross carrying amount

The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance (or impairment allowance before January 01, 2024).

The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

---

## Chunk 79

# 4.1.2.8 Calculation of markup income and expense

Income from performing advances of the domestic operations is recognised on accrual basis as per the terms of the contract. However, where debt securities, classified as investments in the financial statements, are purchased at premium or discount, such premium / discount including the transaction cost is amortized through the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account over the remaining maturity of the debt security using the effective interest rate method. The interest income on staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations is recognized in line with the EIR, while any expected credit losses are assessed and accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. Income from advances except for staff loans and TERF are recognized in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account using contractual rate. Similarly, under the local regulatory requirement, income recoverable on classified domestic advances and investments (debt securities), is recognized on a receipt basis.

Income on rescheduled / restructured advances and investments is recognized as permitted by SBP regulations. In case of overseas operations, income on the financial assets is recognised under the effective interest method or as prescribed by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which the Bank operates. Markup expense on domestic financial liabilities (comprising deposits, subordinated debts, and borrowings) is recognized on an accrual basis in the period in which it is incurred, based on effective interest rate method. In case of overseas operations, such expense is recognised under the effective interest method or as prescribed by the regulatory authorities of the country in which the Bank operates.

---

## Chunk 80

# 4.1.2.9 Derecognition

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between:

- the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognized); and
- the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI shall be recognised in profit or loss.

From January 01, 2024 any cumulative gain / loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated at FVOCI is not recognised in profit and loss account on derecognition of such securities. Any markup on transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Bank is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its statement of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or a portion of them. In such cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised. Examples of such transactions are securities lending and sale-and-repurchase transactions.

When assets are sold to a third party with a concurrent total rate of return swap on the transferred assets, the transaction is accounted for as a secured loan transaction similar to sale-and repurchase transactions, because the Bank retains all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of such assets.

In transactions in which the Bank neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Bank continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.

In certain transactions, the Bank retains the obligation to service the transferred financial asset for a fee. The transferred asset is derecognised if it meets the derecognition criteria. An asset or liability is recognised for the servicing contract if the servicing fee is more than adequate (asset) or is less than adequate (liability) for performing the servicing.

## Chunk 81

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

---

## Chunk 82

# 4.1.2.10 Modification Financial Assets

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of loans to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification are accounted for as follows:

- Fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and
- Other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.

If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

Where derecognition of financial assets is appropriate, the newly recognised residual loans are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classified as purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI).

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the bank first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognise the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred, and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

If such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as markup income calculated using the effective interest rate method.

## Chunk 83

# 4.1.2.11 Reclassification

Financial liabilities are not reclassified subsequent to initial recognition. Reclassifications of financial assets are made when, and only when, the business model for those assets changes. Such changes are expected to be infrequent and arise as a result of significant external or internal changes such as the termination of a line of business or the purchase of a subsidiary whose business model is to realise the value of pre-existing held for trading financial assets through a hold to collect model.

Financial assets are reclassified at their fair value on the date of reclassification and previously recognised gains and losses are not restated. Moreover, reclassifications of financial assets between financial assets held at amortised cost and financial assets held at FVOCI do not affect effective interest rate or expected credit loss computations.

Reclassified from fair value through other comprehensive income

Where debt securities held at FVOCI are reclassified to financial assets held at FVPL, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in comprehensive income is transferred to the profit and loss account.

For debt securities held at FVOCI that are reclassified to financial assets held at amortised cost, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in comprehensive income is adjusted against the fair value of the financial asset such that the financial asset is recorded at a value as if it had always been held at amortised cost. In addition, the related cumulative expected credit losses held within comprehensive income are reversed against the gross carrying value of the reclassified assets at the date of reclassification.

## Chunk 84

# 4.1.2.12 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (ECL) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (12-month ECL). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL).

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# (a) Measurement of ECL

ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:

- financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive);
- financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows;
- undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive; and
- financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Bank expects to recover.

---

## Chunk 86

# (b) Restructured financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows:

- If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset.
- If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in ‘Stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘Stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘Stage 3’.

---

## Chunk 87

# (c) Non-Performing financial assets

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit-impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘non-performing’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- the restructuring of a loan by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.

Under the IFRS 9 Application instructions, the Bank is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. The Bank is required to calculate ECL on its non-performing financial assets as higher of provision under Prudential Regulations (PR) and ECL under IFRS 9. Further, the Banks are advised to recognize income on impaired assets (loans classified under PRs i.e., OAEM and Stage 3 loans) on a receipt basis in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations issued by SBP.

The Bank calculates the ECL against corporate, commercial and SME loan portfolios as higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at borrower/facility level, whereas against the retail borrowers the Bank will calculate ECL at higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at segment/product basis as instructed under Annexure-A of BPRD Circular No. 16 dated July 29, 2024.

Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 and Application Instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

## Chunk 88

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# (a) Probability of default (PD)

The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12 month ECL, Stage1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2). PD is estimated using internal rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk rating. The bank has used Transition Matrix approach for estimation of PD for each internal rating. The bank have used roll-rate method using the days past due (DPD) criteria to estimated PD for its retail portfolio. PD are then adjusted with forward looking information for calculation of ECL.

---

## Chunk 89

# (b) Exposure at default (EAD)

The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant. The Bank estimates EAD for financial assets carried at an amortised cost equal to principal plus profit. Each repayment date is assumed to be default point in the model and the ECL is calculated on EAD at each reporting date and discounted at the effective interest rate. Further, cash and cash equivalent collaterals the Bank holds against the non-retail facilities are adjusted from the LGD.

---

## Chunk 90

# (c) Loss given default (LGD)

An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

## Chunk 91

# Presentation of allowance for Expected Credit Loss in the Unconsolidated Statement of Financial Position

Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the unconsolidated statement of financial position as follows:

- Financial assets measured at amortized cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets.
- For advances measured at cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the advances.
- Loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: as a provision in other liabilities.
- Where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Bank does not identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component and instead presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision.
- Debt instruments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance is recognized in the unconsolidated statement of financial position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance is disclosed and is recognized in OCI.

---

## Chunk 92

# 4.1.2.13 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and/or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PR issued by SBP. Financial assets in Stage 2 may be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum period of 6 months from initial downgrade is required before any facility is moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to move back from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it should meet the criteria defined under the respective Prudential Regulations for de-classification of account/facility. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular No. 03 dated July 05, 2022. However, banks are free to choose more stringent days past due criteria. The Bank aligns its policy with Annexure-C of BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022; hence, SICR is considered if credit exposure exceeds 60 days past due.

## Chunk 93

# 4.1.2.14 Write-offs

Financial assets are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level.

---

## Chunk 94

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in the profit and loss account and OCI.

Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Bank’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

---

## Chunk 95

# 4.1.2.15 Offsetting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

---

## Chunk 96

# 4.1.2.16 Undrawn loan commitments and guarantees

‘Financial guarantees’ are contracts that require the Bank to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. ‘Loan commitments’ are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions.

Financial guarantees issued or commitments to provide a loan at a below-market profit rate are initially measured at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at the higher of the loss allowance determined in accordance with IFRS 9 and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.

When estimating lifetime ECL for undrawn loan commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the loans are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

---

## Chunk 97

# 4.1.2.17 Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank has adopted a governance framework requiring the Risk, Finance, Operations, Internal Audit and IT functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. IFRS 9 requires robust credit risk models that can predict Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD).

The Bank's Credit Division performs credit risk assessment, monitors Significant Increase in Credit Risk of the borrowers, reviews Credit Ratings and obligor attributes.

The IT Division extracts the data required for ECL calculations. IT Division also provide support for system development and upgrades.

The Bank’s Finance Division takes ownership of ECL models and methodologies used in calculation of ECL. Finance Division assess the financial impact, meet the financial reporting requirements and presents quarterly results to Board of Directors (BOD) / its Board Sub Committee.

The Risk Management Division calculates impact of ECL on bank’s capital adequacy, leverage ratio and Liquidity requirements.

As per the Bank's policy, the Bank’s Internal Audit function carries out periodic review of IFRS 9 methodology and impacts calculated by the Management.

(a) Sale under repurchase obligation

Securities sold with a simultaneous commitment to repurchase at a specified future date (repos) continue to be recognised in the unconsolidated statement of financial position and are measured in accordance with accounting policies for investments. Amounts received under these agreements are recorded as repurchase agreement borrowings. The difference between sale and repurchase price is amortised as expense over the term of the repo agreement. These are initially recognised at amount of funds received and subsequently reported as payable under the contractual terms.

(b) Purchase under resale obligation

Securities purchased with a corresponding commitment to resale at a specified future date (reverse repos) are not recognised as investments in the unconsolidated statement of financial position. Amounts paid under these arrangements are included in repurchase agreement lendings. The difference between purchase and resale price is accrued as income over the term of the reverse repo agreement. These are initially recognised at amount of funds disbursed and subsequently reported as receivable under the contractual terms.

Investment in associates are carried at cost, less any accumulated impairment losses.

---

## Chunk 101

# Subsidiaries

Subsidiary is an entity over which the Bank has control. Investments in subsidiary is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. The carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists the investment’s recoverable amount is estimated at higher of its value in use and its fair value less cost to sell. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

Leasehold land and buildings on leasehold land are stated at revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if any. Depreciation on property and equipment (excluding land which is not depreciated) is charged using the straight line method in accordance with the rates specified in note 10.2 to these unconsolidated financial statements after taking into account residual value. The asset's residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if required, at each reporting date. Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that the net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. Valuation techniques and input used are disclosed in note 41 of these unconsolidated financial statements.

The surplus arising on revaluation is credited to other comprehensive income. However, the increase shall be recognised in profit and loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit and loss account. The deficit arising on a particular property as a result of a revaluation is recognised in profit and loss account as an impairment. However, the decrease to be recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset.

Depreciation on buildings which are revalued is determined with reference to the value assigned to such assets on revaluation and depreciation charge for the year is taken to the profit and loss account; and an amount equal to incremental depreciation for the year net of deferred taxation is transferred from “Surplus on Revaluation of Property and equipment Account” to unappropriated profit through Statement of Changes in Equity to record realization of surplus to the extent of the incremental depreciation charge for the year.

## Chunk 107

# 4.8 Lease liability and right-of-use assets

The Bank enters into leasing arrangements for its office premises, branches, ATMs and warehouses. Rental contracts are typically for a fixed period and may have extension options as described below. At inception of a contract, the Bank assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease based on whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Bank's incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentive receivable, variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate which are initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date, amounts expected to be payable by the Bank under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option if the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. The extension and termination options are incorporated in determination of lease term only when the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise these options.

The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The lease liability is also remeasured to reflect any reassessment or lease modification.

The lease liability is remeasured when the Bank reassesses the reasonable certainty of exercise of extension or termination option upon occurrence of either a significant event or a significant change in circumstance, or when there is a change in assessment of an option to purchase underlying asset, or when there is a change in amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or when there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payment. The corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-to-use asset, or is recorded in profit and loss if the carrying amount of right-to-use asset has been reduced to zero.

On initial recognition, right-of-use assets are measured at an amount equal to initial lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost model. The right of use asset is depreciated on a straight line method over the lease term as this method most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits. The right-of-use asset is reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any. Intangible assets are amortised using the straight line method, whereby the cost of the intangible asset is amortised over its estimated useful life over which economic benefits are expected to flow to the Bank. The useful life and amortisation method are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, annually. Intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are carried at cost less any impairment in value and are not amortised. However, these are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.

# 4.10 Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are initially measured at settlement amount and upon revaluation, are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed annually and adjusted, if appropriate. As per SBP's requirement desktop valuation is carried out on annual basis and full-scope valuation after every three years by independent professionally qualified valuers to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. A surplus arising on revaluation of assets is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims' account and any deficit arising on revaluation is taken to unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account directly. Legal fees, transfer costs and direct costs of acquiring title of assets is charged to unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account and not capitalised.

Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realised. Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply to the period wherein the differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the profit and loss account. Deferred tax, if any, on revaluation of investments is recognised as an adjustment to surplus / (deficit) arising on revaluation in accordance with the requirements of IAS-12, 'Income Taxes'.

Mark-up / return / interest on rescheduled / restructured loans and advances and investments is recognised as permitted by the regulations of SBP.
- Where debt securities are purchased at premium or discount, such premium / discount is amortised through the profit and loss account over the remaining period of maturity.
- Financing method is used in accounting for income from lease financing. Under this method, the unearned lease income (excess of the sum of total lease rentals and estimated residual value over the cost of leased assets) is deferred and taken to income over the term of the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding net investment in lease. Gains / losses on termination of lease contracts, documentation charges, front-end fees and other lease income are recognised as income when these are realised.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination before July 01, 2009 is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Bank’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Bank’s cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquirer are assigned to those units or groups of units.

# 4.22 Earnings per share

## Chunk 161

# Key assumptions used in value in use calculation

The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined based on value in use calculation, using cash flow projections based on business plan approved by the Board of Directors of the Bank covering a five year period, duly adjusted for changes based on latest forecasts. The discount rates applied to cash flows beyond five years are extrapolated using a terminal growth rate. The following rates are used by the Bank:

| |2024|2023|
|---|---|---|
|- Discount rate|14.97|18.04|
|- Terminal growth rate|12.00|15.00|

The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to following assumptions:

1. Interest margins
Interest margins are based on prevailing industry trends and anticipated market conditions.
2. Discount rates
Discount rates reflect management estimates of the rate of return required for each business and are calculated after taking into account the prevailing risk free rate, industry risk and business risk. Discount rates are calculated by using cost of equity of the Bank.
3. Key business assumptions
The assumptions are important as they represent management assessment of how the unit's position might change over the projected period. Based on the expansion plans, management expects aggressive growth in advances, investments and deposits during the projected periods and thereafter stabilisation in line with industry trends. Management believes that any significant change in key assumptions, on which CGU's recoverable amount is based, may impact the carrying amount to further exceed its recoverable amount. Value in use calculation of the CGU are sensitive to changes in assumptions for interest rate spreads, Non Funded Income (NFI), long term growth rates and discount rates.
4. Sensitivity to changes in assumption
The estimated recoverable amount of the 'Trading and Sales' CGU exceeds its carrying amount by approximately Rs. 6,563.429 million (2023: Rs. 15,841.101 million). Management has identified two key assumptions for which there could be a reasonably possible change that could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount. The following table shows the amount that these two assumptions are required to change individually in order for the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount.

| |Changes required for carrying amount to equal recoverable amount| | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|- Discount rate| | |0.41|1.53|
|- Terminal growth rate| |-0.47|-1.82| |

For tax years 2009 to 2017, the appeals were decided by ATIR through combined Appellate Order dated 31-01-2022. Though the AO, except for the levy of surcharge under section 4A, minimum tax under section 113 and deduction of Sindh WWF all of the issues involved in the appeal either decided in Bank’s favor (including the issue of goodwill, amortization of which was claimed over the period of 10 years) or set-aside for re-examination by the ATIR.

The Bank as well as the tax department have filed Income Tax Reference Applications before Sindh High Court against above-mentioned order of ATIR, which are pending.

Bank’s appeal for tax years 2018 to 2020 and 2022 are pending for adjudication before ATIR.

In respect of WWF, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in Judgement, PLD 2017 SC 28, that the amendments made in the WWF Ordinance through Finance Act, 2006 and 2008 were illegal and without lawful authority i.e. the banks do not fall into definition of Industrial Undertaking and thus, not liable to pay WWF. Based on that, the Appellate Tribunal through combined Appellate order dated January 31, 2022 has also annulled the OIR’s action of levying WWF on Bank under Worker’s Welfare Fund Ordinance, 1971 in tax years 2009, 2012 and 2013.

As a consequence of the 18th amendment to the Constitution, levy for the WWF was introduced by the Government of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan through the Sindh WWF Act, 2014 (the Act), the Punjab Workers Welfare Fund Act, 2019 and the Balochistan Workers Welfare Fund Act, 2022, respectively. As per these Acts, the Bank is liable to pay WWF in these provinces. However, in this respect:

- The Bank has challenged the issue of jurisdiction claimed by Sindh Revenue Board before the Honorable High Court of Sindh (SHC) on grounds that banking companies cannot be considered as industrial establishment and that the Act cannot be applied to trans-provincial entities. The Court has restrained the Sindh Revenue Board to collect / recover Sindh WWF. For TY 2018 to TY 2023 the Court granted stay from recovery of Sindh WWF upon submission of Bank Guarantee to Nazir of Court.
- The Bank has also received notices regarding the recovery of Balochistan WWF for which the Bank is in discussion with legal counsel to challenge in the court of law on same grounds as in case of Sindh WWF.

In 2018, Based on decision of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Bank had reassessed the provision of WWF which was previously held on the entire operating results of the Bank (including all provinces, part of Pakistan, AJK and Bahrain Operations) and maintained WWF only to the extent of its operations within Sindh Province till 2019. In 2020 after promulgation of Punjab WWF, the Bank has again decided prudently to maintain provision on the entire results of the Bank.

The Sindh High Court has dismissed the Bank’s petitions for tax years 2016 through 2022 wherein the Bank along with other taxpayers challenged the levy of super tax on constitutional grounds. Based on the opinion of legal counsel, the Bank has filed appeal before the Supreme Court against the decision of the Sindh High Court.

The Supreme Court has allowed interim relief to the taxpayers subject to the payment of 50% of the super tax liability. However, the Bank has adjusted full amount of super tax liability for Tax year 2016 and 2019 against the available tax refunds. Further, the bank has obtained stay from the Sindh High Court on other technical grounds regarding the levy of Super Tax for tax years 2017 and 2018.

Through Finance Act 2023, Super tax on high earning persons was levied under section 4C. The Bank has challenged the levy of Super tax for tax year 2023 through the legal counsel before the Islamabad High Court wherein interim stay was granted.

In pursuance of SRO 1588(I)/2023 dated November 21, 2023 banking companies have been designated to the 'sector' for the purpose of section 99D of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, for the years 2022 and 2023. Tax authorities issued a recovery notice to the Bank thereby creating a demand. The Bank through its legal council challenged the levy, and the High Court of Sindh, has decided the case against the Bank. However, the Islamabad High Court and Lahore High Court has suspended the operation of section 99D in other similar petitions. The Bank has decided to file petition against the said levy in the Supreme Court of Pakistan along with the stay application.

# 38. DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN

# 38.1 General description

The Bank operates a recognised gratuity fund for all employees who opted for this scheme introduced by the management with effect from January 01, 2007. Permanent employees are eligible for the gratuity fund after 10 years of continuous service. Gratuity is payable at 65% of the last drawn basic salary per completed year of service. The defined benefit is administered by a separate fund that is legally separate from the Bank. The plan is governed by the trust deed dated September 01, 2007. The trustees of the gratuity fund consist of representatives from both the employer and the employees. The trustees of the gratuity fund are required by the trust deed to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme, i.e. active employees, inactive employees, retirees and employers. The trustees of the gratuity fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund. The present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in this unconsolidated statement of financial position.

---

## Chunk 219

# 38.2 The plan in Pakistan typically exposes the Bank to actuarial risks such as:

- Salary increase risk: The risk that the final salary at the time of cessation of services is greater than assumed. Since the benefit is calculated on the final salary (which will closely reflect inflation and other macroeconomic factors), the benefit amount increases as salary increases.
- Discount rate risk: The discount rate is based on the yield on government bonds. If the market yield of bonds varies, the discount rate would vary in the same manner and would affect the present value of obligation and fair value of assets.
- Demographic Risks:
- Withdrawal risk: The risk of actual withdrawals experience is different from assumed withdrawal probability. The significance of the withdrawal risk varies with the age, service and the entitled benefits of the beneficiary.
- Longevity Risk: The risk that the actual mortality experience is different than the assumed mortality. This effect is more pronounced in schemes where the age and service distribution is on the higher side.
- Investment risk: This is the risk that the assets are under-performing and are not sufficient to meet the liabilities.

# 38.3 Number of employees under the schemes

The number of employees covered under the gratuity scheme are: 4,131 (2023: 4,010).

# 38.4 Principal actuarial assumptions

| |2024|2023|
|---|---|---|
|Discount rate|12.25%|16.00%|
|Expected rate of return on plan assets|16.00%|14.50%|

# 41. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. Fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities and fixed term deposits cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 41.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyzes financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of fair values within level 2

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Units of mutual funds|Fair values of investments in units of mutual funds are determined based on redemption prices disclosed at the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) as at the close of the business days.|
|Market Treasury Bills (MTB), Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIB) and GoP Sukuks|Fair values of Pakistan Investment Bonds and Market Treasury Bills are derived using PKRV, PKFRV and PKISRV rates.|
|Debt Securities (TFCs) and Sukuk other than Government|Investments in debt securities (comprising of Term Finance Certificates, Bonds and any other security issued by a company or a body corporate for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the SECP.|
|Overseas Government Sukuks, Overseas and Euro Bonds|The fair value of Overseas Government Sukuks, and Overseas Bonds are valued on the basis of price available on Bloomberg.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the foreign exchange revaluation rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
|Derivatives|The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currencies involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration, etc.|
|Property and Equipment - Land and buildings|Land and buildings and Non-banking assets under satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values as disclosed in note 10 and 13 of these unconsolidated financial statements. The valuations are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of State Bank of Pakistan. The valuation experts used a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank’s properties. The market approach used prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties.|

# Financial instruments - Level 3

Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.

# 41.2

The Bank's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the year.

The SBP through its BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 has prescribed the minimum paid-up capital (net of accumulated losses) for banks to be raised to Rs.10,000 million by the year ending December 31, 2013. The paid-up capital of the Bank as at December 31, 2024 stood at Rs. 20,506.525 million (2023: Rs. 20,506,525 million) and is in compliance with SBP requirements.

The Banks are also required to maintain a minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 10.0% plus capital conservation buffer of 1.5% of the risk weighted exposures of the Bank. Further, under Basel III instructions, Banks are also required to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio and Tier 1 ratio of 7.5% and 9.0%, respectively (inclusive of Capital Conservation Buffer). As at December 31, 2024 the Bank is fully compliant with prescribed ratios, as the Bank’s CAR is 13.24% whereas CET 1 and Tier 1 ratios stood at 8.98% and 10.13% respectively. The Bank has complied with all capital requirements throughout the year.

Under the current capital adequacy regulations, credit risk and market risk exposures are measured using the Standardized Approach and operational risk is measured using the Basic Indicator Approach. Credit risk mitigants are also applied against the Bank’s exposures based on eligible collateral under comprehensive approach.

# 46. RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk Management is a discipline at the core of every financial institution and encompasses all the activities that affect its risk profile. At the Bank, it involves identification, measurement, monitoring and controlling risks to ensure that:

- a) The individuals who take or manage risks clearly understand it;
- b) The Bank's Risk exposure is within the limits established by Board of Directors (BoD);
- c) Risk taking decisions are in line with the business strategy and objectives set by BoD;
- d) The expected payoffs compensate for the risks taken;
- e) Risk taking decisions are explicit and clear;
- f) Sufficient capital as a buffer is available to take risk; and
- g) Risk management function is independent of risk taking unit.

The Bank has a comprehensive set of Risk Management policies, practices and procedures which enable the Bank to take into consideration, in an appropriate manner, all major kinds of risks mainly credit, market, liquidity, operational and IT security risks. Keeping in view the dynamics of internal and external environment, we regularly review and update our Risk Management policies and procedures in accordance with regulatory environment and international standards.

Risk Management activities remain at the forefront of all activities of the Bank which places the highest priority on conducting its business in a prudent manner in line with the relevant laws and regulatory requirements.

Risk management framework of the Bank includes:

- a) Clearly defined risk management policies and procedures covering risk identification, acceptance, measurement, monitoring, reporting and control;
- b) Well constituted organizational structure, defining clearly roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in risk taking as well as managing it. The Bank, in addition to risk management functions for various risk categories, has instituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC), Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC) as well as Central Credit Committee (CCC). RMC oversees the overall credit risk management at the Bank and provides guidance in setting strategic targets as well as concentration limits and monitors progress related to earnings growth, keeping in view the capital constraints and also adheres to the concentration limits. The RMC monitors the strategic target and aggregate exposure at the Business Group level and concentration limits (by industry, geography, size, tenor) so that one category of assets or dimension of risk cannot materially harm the performance of the Bank. RMC also monitors the advances portfolio, concentrations limits, aggregate limits at business level and various house keeping elements under Credit Administration. Risk Management Committee also oversees the progress of non performing loans and cases under litigation along with the recommendation of transferring of any NPL to Corporate Restructuring Company (CRC). ORMC oversees the effectiveness of operational risk management for maintenance and implementation of operational risk management framework. It also monitors the Business Continuity Planning and reviews findings of any other management or board's sub committee. Whereas, Central Credit Committee (CCC) is entrusted with the responsibility of monitoring lending risk profile of the Bank. CCC meets regularly to actively supervise credit risk across its lending portfolio;
- c) An effective management information system that ensures flow of information from operational level to top management and a system to address any exceptions observed; and
- d) A mechanism to ensure an ongoing review of systems, policies and procedures for risk management and procedures to adopt changes.

While the overall responsibility of risk management rests with the BoD, it is the duty of Senior Management to devise risk management strategy by setting up well defined policies and procedures for mitigating / controlling risks, duly approved by the Board.

# 46.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk which arises with the possibility that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge its
obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. Credit risk is managed in terms of credit policies,
approved by the BoD and regulations issued by the SBP. The Bank is exposed to credit risk on loans and advances,
fund placements with financial institutions and certain investments.

Credit risk management is an ongoing process. The overall credit policy and the credit risk instructions are issued by
the Board of Directors. In this regards, a Central Credit Committee (CCC) is entrusted with the responsibility of
monitoring lending risk profile of the bank. In order to maintain healthy growth of the credit portfolio, the Bank’s Credit
Risk Management processes are consistently upgraded and improved to meet future challenges.

The Bank’s strategy is to minimize credit risk through product, geography, industry and customer diversification. Credit
limits are established for all counter-parties after a careful assessment of their credit worthiness. An effective credit
granting procedure, which requires pre-sanction evaluation of credit proposal, adequacy of security and pre-
disbursement examination of charge documents is in place and managed by Credit Risk Group (CRG), Risk
Management Group (RMG) & Credit Administration Department (CAD). The Bank maintains a sound portfolio
diversified in nature to counter the risk of credit concentration and further confines risk through diversification of its
assets by geographical and industrial sector. For managing impaired assets in the portfolio, the Bank follows the
Prudential Regulations and Risk Management guidelines issued by SBP and the Credit related policies approved by
the Board.

# 46.2 Market Risk

Market Risk is the risk of loss in earnings and capital due to adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and market conditions. Thus market risk can be further described into Interest Rate Risk, Foreign Exchange Risk and Equity Position Risk.

The Bank has an approved market risk policy wherein the governance structure for managing market risk, measurement tools used and the market risk exposure limits have been addressed. The Bank’s strategy for managing market risk is to relate the level of risk exposures to their risk appetite and the capital at hand.

The Board of Directors (BoD) and the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) are responsible for addressing market risk from a strategic perspective and are assisted by the market risk function in meeting these objectives.

The Market Risk Unit reports directly to Head ERM and is responsible for ensuring the implementation of market risk policy in line with the Bank’s strategy.

Risk reporting undertaken by the market risk function includes:

- a) Portfolio Reports
- b) Limit monitoring reports
- c) Sensitivity analysis; and
- d) Stress testing of the portfolio

Currently, the Bank is using the market risk standardised approach for the purpose of computing regulatory capital, the details of which are set out above.

# 46.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Main objective of foreign exchange risk management is to ensure that the foreign exchange exposure of the Bank lies within the defined appetite of the Bank.

Daily reports are generated to monitor the internal and regulatory limits with respect to the overall foreign currency exposures. The overall net open position, whether short or long has the potential to negatively impact the profit and loss depending upon the direction of movement in foreign exchange rates.

Foreign exchange open and mismatched positions are marked to market on a daily basis.

Currency risk arises where the value of financial instruments changes due to changes in foreign exchange rates. In order to manage currency risk exposure, the bank enters into ready / spot, forward and swap transactions with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and in the inter bank market. The Bank’s foreign exchange exposure comprises of forward contracts, foreign currencies cash in hand, balances with banks abroad, foreign placement with SBP and foreign currencies assets and liabilities. The net open position is managed within the statutory limits, as fixed by SBP. Counter parties’ limits are also fixed to limit risk concentration. Appropriate segregation of duties exists between the front and back-office functions while compliance with the net open position limit is independently monitored on an ongoing basis.

# 46.2.3 Equity position Risk

Equity positions in the banking book include Investment in equities that are available-for-sale or held for strategic investment purposes. These investments are generally regarded as riskier relative to fixed income securities owing to the inherent volatility of stock market prices. The Bank mitigates these risks through diversification and capping maximum exposures in a single company, compliance with regulatory requirement, and following the guidelines laid down in the Bank’s Investment Policy as set by the Board of Directors (BoD). The Bank follows a delivery versus payment settlement system thereby minimizing risk available in relation to settlement risk.

Equity price risk is managed by applying Portfolio level limits and scrip-wise stop loss monitoring.

# 46.4 Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank will not be able to raise funds to meet its commitments. The Bank's Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) manages the liquidity position on a continuous basis.

The Bank's policy for liquidity management is to maintain adequate liquidity at all times and in all currencies under both normal and stress conditions, to meet its contractual and potential payment obligations without incurring additional and unacceptable cost to the business.

Treasury is responsible for the managing liquidity risk under the guidance of Asset-Liability Committee of the Bank. The Bank's liquidity risk management approach starts at the intraday level (operational liquidity) managing the daily payments queue and factoring in our access to the qualifying securities of State Bank of Pakistan. It then covers tactical liquidity risk management dealing with the access to unsecured funding sources and the liquidity characteristics of our asset inventory (asset liquidity). Finally, the strategic perspective comprises the maturity profile of all assets and liabilities on our statement of financial position.

For monitoring and controlling liquidity risk, the Bank generates a scenario sensitive maturity statement of financial position, and run controlled mismatches that are monitored and discussed by ALCO members regularly. The Bank prepares various types of reports and analysis for assisting ALCO in taking necessary strategic actions for managing liquidity risk in the Bank. These include liquidity ratios, Concentration analysis, Gap reports, Stress testing, Liquidity Coverage ratio & Net Stable Funding Ratio analysis etc.

The Bank calculates Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) on a monthly basis. Based on December 31, 2024 numbers LCR is 190.5% against SBP minimum requirement of 100%, with Total Stock of High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) of Rs. 198,354.2 million and Net Cash Outflows of Rs. 104,122.5 million. On monthly basis during the year, LCR has remained well over the minimum threshold ranging from 190.5% to 426.01% during the year.

Furthermore, Based on December 31, 2024 numbers the NSFR is 179.37% against SBP minimum requirement of 100%, with Total Available Stable Funding of Rs. 483,536.2 million and Total Required Stable Funding of Rs. 269,567.3 million.

The Bank strategically emphasizes diversification and stability in its funding approach. Its funding base is varied, encompassing stable sources like equity, subordinated loans, retail and small business deposits, and less stable forms such as deposits from larger entities. It is fully compliant with Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), ensuring an ample supply of high-quality liquidity assets relative to liabilities.

The Bank employs stress testing to assess its balance sheet's vulnerability to hypothetical stress events. Liquidity risk factors undergo significant shocks, and their impact on the balance sheet is quantified. Stress testing encompasses scenarios defined by both regulatory standards and internally identified risks. Results are communicated to senior management, the Board of Directors, and regulators.

A Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) is in place to address liquidity challenges during crises. CFP identifying stress scenarios and corresponding funding plans, incorporating early warning indicators. Three Contingency Levels are defined in CFP with varying action Plans for each.

The Liquidity Coverage Ratio's (LCR) key drivers include High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) and Net Cash Outflow, determined by asset liquidity quality and liability profile volatility. The composition of HQLA as of December 31, 2024, is detailed as below:

|Level 1 Assets:|Rs. 194,476 billion|
|---|---|
|Level 2 Assets:|Rs. 3,759.6 billion|

# 2.2.3 Acquisition Accounting

Acquisitions of businesses not under common control are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the bank, liabilities incurred by the bank to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Bank in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account as incurred.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.

Goodwill on acquisition is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.

Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the Group's net assets in the event of liquidation is measured at proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree at the date of the acquisition.

# 3. BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for:

- - Certain classes of property and equipment and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims which are
stated at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation.
- - Investments classified under Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVPL) and Fair Value through Other Comprehensive
Income (FVOCI) and derivative financial instruments, which are measured at fair value.
- - Certain concessional rate advances and related borrowing (Staff Loans and Financing / Borrowing under SBP TERF
Schemes).
- - Net obligations in respect of defined benefit schemes which are carried at their present values.
- - Lease liability against right-of-use assets that are carried at present value.

# 4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, except as disclosed in note 4.1 below.

# 4.1 Changes in Accounting Policies

# 4.1.1 Revised format of consolidated financial statements

SBP through its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 09, 2023, and BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 dated April 13, 2023, amended the format of quarterly, half yearly and annual financial statements of banks effective from accounting years starting from January 01, 2024 and onwards. Accordingly, the Group has prepared these consolidated financial statements on the new format prescribed by SBP. The adoption of the new format contains additional disclosures and certain changes in the financial statements’ presentation, primarily due to the implementation of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan. However, the corresponding figures continue to be classified and disclosed in accordance with the previous financial accounting and reporting framework.

Adoption of revised financial statements format has also resulted in following material changes (due to which the corresponding presentations have also been changed):

- Right-of-use-assets (Note 11) amounting to Rs. 7,078.577 million (2023: Rs. 5,848.280 million) which were previously shown as part of property and equipment (note 10) are now shown separately on the consolidated statement of financial position.
- Lease liabilities (Note 17) amounting to Rs. 7,845.190 million (2023: Rs. 6,686.639 million) which were previously shown as part of other liabilities (note 20) are now shown separately on the consolidated statement of financial position.

# 4.1.2 Impact of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

During the year, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 dated April 13, 2023, International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9, ‘Financial Instruments' became applicable to Banks in Pakistan.

BPRD Circular No. 03 dated July 05, 2022 issued by SBP provides detailed instructions on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks, which were further clarified from time to time.

IFRS 9 addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘expected credit losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions from January 01, 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at January 01, 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard. Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9.

SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 made amendments and extended the timelines of application instructions. Under the new guidelines, the banks are required to implement modification accounting for financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the Standard. These changes took effect from October 01, 2024, and have been applied retrospectively from January 01, 2024. SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 dated January 22, 2025, further clarified that modification accounting would be applied to loans modified on or after January 01, 2020.

## Chunk 337

# 4.1.2.1.2

Certain debt securities are held by the Group in separate portfolios to meet everyday liquidity needs. The Group seeks to minimise the costs of managing these liquidity needs and therefore actively manages the return on the portfolio. That return consists of collecting contractual payments as well as gains and losses from the sale of financial assets. The investment strategy often results in sales activity that is significant in value. The Group considers that under IFRS 9 these securities are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.

---

## Chunk 338

# 4.1.2.1.3

These financial assets are held by overseas branch. As per paragraph 1.2 of the Application Instruction, in relation to overseas branch, IFRS 9 will be applicable based on their respective host country’s regulatory accounting practices. Since IFRS 9 was already applicable to overseas branches as at 01 January 2024, there is no impact of IFRS 9 adoption on these financial assets.

# 4.1.2.1.4

The Group previously classified certain equity investments as Available-for-Sale (AFS). Upon implementing IFRS 9, the Group made an irrevocable election to classify certain equity investments at FVOCI whereas the default category was for FVPL.

---

## Chunk 339

# 4.1.2.1.5

Certain debt securities are held by the Group in a separate portfolio for long-term yield. These securities may be sold, but such sales are not expected to be more than infrequent. The Group considers that these securities are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect the contractual cash flows. These assets are classified as amortised cost under IFRS 9.

# 4.1.2.1.6

This includes puttable instrument that can be put back at any time for cash equal to a proportionate share of the net asset value of an entity. These assets are therefore mandatorily classified at FVPL under IFRS 9.

# 4.1.2.1.7

This includes expected credit loss against off-balance sheet items.

## Chunk 340

# 4.1.2.2

Impact on regulatory capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the banks, which has reduced their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the 'Application Instructions' issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement.

The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the transitional adjustment amount) must be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the transition period of five years.

Moreover, SBP has allowed to adjust the amount of stage 1 and stage 2 provisions in Tier 2 Capital that have not been added back to CET 1 and vice versa as per Annexure-A of BPRD Circular No. 16 dated July 29, 2024.

The impact of adoption of IFRS 9 on the capital ratios of the Holding Company and BIPL, as disclosed in the respective financial statements were as follows:

|JS Bank Limited|CAR would have been higher by 38 bps|
|---|---|
|Bank Islami Pakistan Limited|CAR would have been higher by 35 bps|

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# 4.1.2.3  Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business
model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest
(SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) regardless of the business model in which they
are held.

---

## Chunk 342

# 4.1.2.3.1 Recognition and initial measurement

Debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially
recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVPL, transaction costs that are directly
attributable to its acquisition or issue. The fair value of a financial asset on initial recognition is generally its transaction price. If the
Group determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price then the financial instrument is initially
measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price.

Subsequently, that difference is recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account on an appropriate basis over the life of
the asset but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data, or the transaction is closed out.

Advances other than staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations
are initially measured at transaction price i.e., the amount of loan disbursed at disbursement date.

Staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) loans and advances pertaining to overseas operations are recognised
at fair value at the time of disbursement. The fair value is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using the
prevailing market rates for instruments. The difference between the disbursed amount and the fair value at initial recognition is
recorded as a prepayment.

---

## Chunk 343

# 4.1.2.3.2 Classification

(a)  Financial Assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset other than advances except for staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility
(TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations is classified as measured at amortised cost, FVOCI or FVPL.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets;
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held-for-trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent
changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business models for
managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period
following changes in the business model.

Advances are carried at cost, net of expected credit loss allowances, excluding staff loans, Temporary Economic Refinance
Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations, which are measured at amortised cost.

## Chunk 344

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# (b) Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), when they are held-for-trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method. Markup expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account.

Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in scope of the standard are never bifurcated. Instead, the whole hybrid instrument is assessed for classification.

---

## Chunk 345

# 4.1.2.4 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either held-to-collect, held-to-collect and sale and others based on Business Model Assessment. The Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The assessment requires judgement based on facts and circumstances on the date of assessment. The information considered mainly includes:

- the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual markup revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group’s management;
- the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and its strategy for how those risks are managed;
- how managers of the business are compensated (e.g., whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected); and
- the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Group’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case' scenarios into account.

Transfer of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Group continuing recognition of the financial assets.

Financial assets that are held-for-trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVPL because they are neither held-to-collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

---

## Chunk 346

# 4.1.2.5 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as interest margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Group considers:

- contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
- leverage features;
- prepayment and extension terms;
- terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and
- features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).

---

## Chunk 347

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

A prepayment feature is consistent with the SPPI criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and markup on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a discount or premium to its contractual par-amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.

the Group holds a portfolio of long-term fixed-rate loan for which the Group has the option to propose to revise the interest rate at periodic reset dates. These reset rights are limited to the market rate at the time of revision. The borrowers have an option to either accept the revised rate or redeem the financing at par without penalty. the Group has determined that the contractual cash flows of these loan are SPPI because the option varies the interest rate in a way that is in consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic financing risks and costs associated with the principal amount outstanding.

## Chunk 348

# 4.1.2.6 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

|Financial assets at FVPL|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any markup or dividend income, are recognised in profit and loss account.|
|---|---|
|Financial assets at amortised cost|These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method in case of investments, lendings to financial institutions, cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks, Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF), staff loans, and advances pertaining to overseas operations and other financial assets. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Markup, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account.|
|Debt investments at FVOCI|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and is assessed for impairment under the new ECL model. Markup income is calculated using the effective interest method and includes amortisation of premiums and accretion of discount, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to consolidated statement of profit and loss account.|
|Equity investments at FVOCI|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value.

# 4.1.2.7 Amortised cost and gross carrying amount

The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance (or impairment allowance before January 01, 2024).

The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

# 4.1.2.8  Calculation of markup income and expense

Income from performing advances of the domestic operations is recognised on accrual basis as per the terms of the contract. However, where debt securities, classified as investments in the financial statements, are purchased at premium or discount, such premium / discount including the transaction cost is amortised through the consolidated statement of profit and loss account over the remaining maturity of the debt security using the effective interest rate method. The interest income on staff loans and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and advances pertaining to overseas operations is recognised in line with the EIR, while any expected credit losses are assessed and accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. Income from advances except for staff loans and TERF are recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss account using contractual rate. Similarly, under the local regulatory requirement, income recoverable on classified domestic advances and investments (debt securities), is recognised on a receipt basis.

Income on rescheduled / restructured advances and investments is recognised as permitted by SBP regulations. In case of overseas operations, income on the financial assets is recognised under the effective interest method or as prescribed by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which the Group operates. Markup expense on domestic financial liabilities (comprising deposits, subordinated debts, and borrowings) is recognised on an accrual basis in the period in which it is incurred, based on effective interest rate method. In case of overseas operations, such expense is recognised under the effective interest method or as prescribed by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which the Group operates.

In accordance with the BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 dated January 22, 2025, Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) are allowed to follow Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) 1 & 2 where applicable and continue the existing accounting methodology on other Islamic products until issuance of further instruction in this regard. In this respect, income from performing financing is recognized on accrual basis as per the terms of the contract.

# 4.1.2.9  Derecognition

The Group derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between:

- the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised); and
- the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI shall be recognised in profit or loss.

From January 01, 2024 any cumulative gain / loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated at FVOCI is not recognised in profit and loss account on derecognition of such securities. Any markup on transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability. The Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its statement of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or a portion of them. In such cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised. Examples of such transactions are securities lending and sale-and-repurchase transactions.

---

## Chunk 352

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

When assets are sold to a third party with a concurrent total rate of return swap on the transferred assets, the transaction is accounted for as a secured loan transaction similar to sale-and repurchase transactions, because the Group retains all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of such assets.

In transactions in which the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.

In certain transactions, the Group retains the obligation to service the transferred financial asset for a fee. The transferred asset is derecognised if it meets the derecognition criteria. An asset or liability is recognised for the servicing contract if the servicing fee is more than adequate (asset) or is less than adequate (liability) for performing the servicing.

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

---

## Chunk 353

# 4.1.2.10 Modification

(a) Financial Assets

The Group sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of loans to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification are accounted for as follows:

- fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and
- other fees are included in consolidated statement of profit and loss account as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.

If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the Group plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

Where derecognition of financial assets is appropriate, the newly recognised residual loans are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classified as purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI).

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the Group first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognise the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred, and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

If such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as markup income calculated using the effective interest rate method.

## Chunk 354

# 4.1.2.11 Reclassification

Financial liabilities are not reclassified subsequent to initial recognition. Reclassifications of financial assets are made when, and only when, the business model for those assets changes. Such changes are expected to be infrequent and arise as a result of significant external or internal changes such as the termination of a line of business or the purchase of a subsidiary whose business model is to realise the value of pre-existing held for trading financial assets through a hold to collect model.

Financial assets are reclassified at their fair value on the date of reclassification and previously recognised gains and losses are not restated. Moreover, reclassifications of financial assets between financial assets held at amortised cost and financial assets held at FVOCI do not affect effective interest rate or expected credit loss computations.

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

Reclassified from fair value through other comprehensive income Where debt securities held at FVOCI are reclassified to financial assets held at FVPL, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in comprehensive income is transferred to the profit and loss account.

For debt securities held at FVOCI that are reclassified to financial assets held at amortised cost, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in comprehensive income is adjusted against the fair value of the financial asset such that the financial asset is recorded at a value as if it had always been held at amortised cost. In addition, the related cumulative expected credit losses held within comprehensive income are reversed against the gross carrying value of the reclassified assets at the date of reclassification.

## Chunk 356

# 4.1.2.12 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (ECL) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (12-month ECL). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL).

---

## Chunk 357

# (a) Measurement of ECL

ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:

- financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive);
- financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows;
- undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Group if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive; and
- financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Group expects to recover.

---

## Chunk 358

# (b) Restructured financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows:

- If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset.
- If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.
- Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in ‘Stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘Stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘Stage 3’.

---

## Chunk 359

# (c) Non-Performing financial assets

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit-impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘non-performing’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

---

## Chunk 360

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- the restructuring of a loan by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.

Under the IFRS 9 Application instructions, the Group is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. The Group is required to calculate ECL on its non-performing financial assets as higher of provision under Prudential Regulations (PR) and ECL under IFRS 9. Further, the Groups are advised to recognize income on impaired assets (loans classified under PRs i.e., OAEM and Stage 3 loans) on a receipt basis in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations issued by SBP.

The Group calculates the ECL against corporate, commercial and SME loan portfolios as higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at borrower/facility level, whereas against the retail borrowers the Group will calculate ECL at higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at segment/product basis as instructed under Annexure-A of BPRD Circular No. 16 dated July 29, 2024.

Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 and Application Instructions, the Group has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

1. Probability of default (PD)
The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12 month ECL, Stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2). PD is estimated using internal rating classes and are based on the Group’s internal risk rating. The Group has used Transition Matrix approach for estimation of PD for each internal rating. The Group have used roll-rate method using the days past due (DPD) criteria to estimate PD for its retail portfolio. PD are then adjusted with forward looking information for calculation of ECL.
2. Exposure at default (EAD)
The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant. The Group estimates EAD for financial assets carried at an amortised cost equal to principal plus profit. Each repayment date is assumed to be default point in the model and the ECL is calculated on EAD at each reporting date and discounted at the effective interest rate. Further, cash and cash equivalent collaterals the Group holds against the non-retail facilities are adjusted from the LGD.
3. Loss given default (LGD)
An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Group expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

# Presentation of allowance for Expected Credit Loss in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position

Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position as follows:

- Financial assets measured at amortised cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets.
- For advances measured at cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the advances.
- Loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: as a provision in other liabilities.
- Where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Group does not identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component and instead presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision; and
- Debt instruments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance is disclosed and is recognised in OCI.

## Chunk 362

# 4.1.2.13 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Group used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and/or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PR issued by SBP. Financial assets in Stage 2 may be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum period of 6 months from initial downgrade is required before any facility is moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to move back from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it should meet the criteria defined under the respective Prudential Regulations for de-classification of account/facility. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular No. 03 dated July 05, 2022. However, banks are free to choose more stringent days past due criteria. The Group aligns its policy with Annexure-C of BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022; hence, SICR is considered if credit exposure exceeds 60 days past due.

## Chunk 363

# 4.1.2.14 Write-offs

Financial assets are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level.

Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in the profit and loss account and OCI. Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

# 4.1.2.15 Offsetting

# 4.1.2.16  Undrawn loan commitments and guarantees:

‘Financial guarantees’ are contracts that require the Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. ‘Loan commitments’ are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions.

Financial guarantees issued or commitments to provide a loan at a below-market profit rate are initially measured at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at the higher of the loss allowance determined in accordance with IFRS 9 and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.

When estimating lifetime ECL for undrawn loan commitments, the Group estimates the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the loans are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. This influence is assessed based on the Group's potential voting rights that are currently exercisable in the entity that allow the bank to participate in but not control decision-making. Investment in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

Under the equity method, the investment in associates are initially recognised at cost and the carrying amount of investment is increased or decreased to recognise the investor's share of the post acquisition profits or losses, share of other comprehensive income or loss and share of the post acquisition movement in other reserves. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. However, in case where associates are considered as fully impaired and financial statements are not available these investments are stated at cost less provision.

In addition to above, certain mutual funds are managed by JS Investments Limited (JSIL), the subsidiary company of the Bank. As stipulated under Regulation 38 of Non-Banking Finance Regulation, 2008, the Asset Management Company (AMC) is entrusted with fiduciary duties towards the unit holders of the funds. This fiduciary obligation requires AMC to act in the best interests of its unit holders, refraining from exploiting opportunities for its own benefit or that of its related parties, group companies, or employees, to the detriment of the unit holders. Therefore, the Bank has significant influence over such mutual funds due to participation in the investee's policy-making processes via the JSIL and investment in such mutual funds is considered as investment in associates even if the holding is less than 20%.

These mutual funds are not considered subsidiary due to the legal trust structure of the entity, the Bank does not have the ability to affect returns through its power over the investee. Further, under this trust structure, the trusteeship is separate from the management, and the independent trustees play a key role in overseeing the activities of the AMC.

# 4.8 Lease liability and right-of-use assets

The Group enters into leasing arrangements for its office premises, branches, ATMs and warehouses. Rental contracts are typically for a fixed period and may have extension options as described below. At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease based on whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 8 dated April 30, 2019 and BPRD Circular No. BPRD/RPD/2019/17 dated July 26, 2019 has directed all Islamic Banks to apply IFRS 16 - 'Leases' in all Ijarah (lease) contracts where the Islamic Banks acts in capacity of Mustajir (lessee).

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not be terminated).

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or if that rate cannot be readily determined, the respective entity's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentive receivable, variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate which are initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date, amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. The extension and termination options are incorporated in determination of lease term only when the Group is reasonably certain to exercise these options.

The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The lease liability is also remeasured to reflect any reassessment or lease modification.

The lease liability is remeasured when the Group reassesses the reasonable certainty of exercise of extension or termination option upon occurrence of either a significant event or a significant change in circumstance, or when there is a change in assessment of an option to purchase underlying asset, or when there is a change in amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or when there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payment. The corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-to-use asset, or is recorded in profit and loss if the carrying amount of right-to-use asset has been reduced to zero.

## Chunk 390

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

On initial recognition, right-of-use assets are measured at an amount equal to initial lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost model. The right of use asset is depreciated on a straight line method over the lease term as this method most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits. The right-of-use asset is reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

## Chunk 391

# 4.9 Intangible assets

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any. Intangible assets are amortised from the month when the assets are available for use, using the straight line method, whereby the cost of the intangible asset is amortised over its estimated useful life over which economic benefits are expected to flow to the Group. The useful life and amortisation method are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, annually.

Intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are carried at cost less any impairment in value and are not amortised. However, these are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.

The useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed annually and adjusted, if appropriate. As per SBP's requirement desktop valuation is carried out on annual basis and full-scope valuation after every three years by independent professionally qualified valuers to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. A surplus arising on revaluation of assets is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims' account and any deficit arising on revaluation is taken to consolidated statement of profit and loss account directly. Legal fees, transfer costs and direct costs of acquiring title of assets is charged to consolidated statement of profit and loss account and not capitalised.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# 12.1.1

This includes transfer from capital work in progress during the year of Rs. 1,651.089 million (2023: Rs. 1,163.641 million).

# 12.2

The cost of fully amortised intangible assets that are still in the Group's use amounted to Rs. 1,025.103 million (2023: Rs. 940.543 million).

# 12.3

Goodwill is recorded by the Group upon the event fully disclosed in note 1.1. For impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to 'Trading and Sales' Segment as a Cash Generating Unit (CGU), which is also a reportable segment.

---

## Chunk 461

# Key assumptions used in calculation of value-in-use

The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined based on value-in-use calculation, using cash flow projections based on business plan approved by the Board of Directors of the Bank covering a five year period, duly adjusted for changes based on latest forecasts. The discount rates applied to cash flows beyond five years are extrapolated using a terminal growth rate. The following rates are used by the Group:

| |2024|2023|
|---|---|---|
|- Discount rate|14.97|18.04|
|- Terminal growth rate|12.00|15.00|

The calculation of value-in-use is most sensitive to following assumptions:

1. Interest margin
Interest margin is based on prevailing industry trends and anticipated market conditions.
2. Discount rate
Discount rate reflect management estimates of the rate of return required for each business and is calculated after taking into account the prevailing risk free rate, industry risk and business risk. Discount rate is calculated by using cost of equity of the holding company.
3. Key business assumptions
The assumptions are important as they represent management assessment of how the unit's position might change over the projected period. Based on the expansion plans, management expects aggressive growth in advances, investments and deposits during the projected periods and thereafter stabilisation in line with industry trends.
4. Sensitivity to changes in assumption
The estimated recoverable amount of the 'Trading and Sales' CGU exceeds its carrying amount by approximately Rs. 6,563 million (2023: Rs. 15,841 million). Management has identified two key assumptions for which there could be a reasonably possible change that could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount. The following table shows the amount that these two assumptions are required to change individually in order for the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount.

| |Changes required for carrying amount to equal recoverable amount| |
|---|---|---|
| |2024|2023|
|- Discount rate|0.41|1.53|
|- Terminal growth rate|-0.47|-1.82|

## Chunk 463

# Key assumptions used in calculation of value-in-use

The recoverable amount of Goodwill has been determined based on value-in-use calculation, using cash flow projections based on financial projections approved by the management of BIPL covering a five year period. The discount rates applied to cash flows beyond five years are extrapolated using a terminal growth rate. The following rates are used by BIPL.

| |2024|2023|
|---|---|---|
|- Discount rate|15.82|20.66|
|- Terminal growth rate|5.00|5.00|

The calculation of value-in-use is most sensitive to following assumptions:

1. Profit margins
Profit margins are based on prevailing industry trends and anticipated market conditions.
2. Discount rates
Discount rates reflect management estimates of the rate of return required for each business and are calculated after taking into account the prevailing risk free rate, industry risk and business risk. Discount rates are calculated by using cost of equity of BIPL.
3. Key business assumptions
The assumptions are important as they represent management assessment of how BIPL's financial position might change over the projected period. Based on the expansion plans, management expects aggressive growth in financing, investments and deposits during the projected periods and thereafter stabilization in line with industry trends.
4. Sensitivity to changes in assumption
The estimated recoverable amount of Goodwill exceeds its carrying amount by approximately Rs. 11,032.794 million. Management has identified two key assumptions for which there could be a reasonably possible change that could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount. The following table shows the amount that these two assumptions are required to change individually in order for the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount.

| |Changes required for carrying amount to equal recoverable amount|
|---|---|
|- Discount rate|5.18|
|- Terminal growth rate|-11.79|

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# 34.2 JS Bank Limited (the Bank)

# 34.2.1 Income Tax

The Bank has filed income tax returns under Section 114 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for the tax years 2007 through 2024. The returns so filed considered as deemed assessment order under Section 120(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (the Ordinance). Later, the return of income for tax years 2008 to 2024 were amended by the Officers of Inland Revenue (OIR) by taking recourse of tax audit or alternatively through amendment the assessment contending that certain matters in the deemed assessments were allegedly not conforming to the law and prejudiced the interest of revenue.

The Bank contested the disallowances before the Commissioner Inland Revenue Appeals [CIR(A)] and the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue [ATIR]. For tax year 2008, both the CIR(A) and ATIR annulled the OIR’s action of amending the assessment being barred by time limitation following the judgments of Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan.

For tax years 2009 to 2017, the appeals were decided by ATIR through combined Appellate Order dated 31-01-2022. Though the AO, except for the levy of surcharge under section 4A, minimum tax under section 113 and deduction of Sindh WWF all of the issues involved in the appeal either decided in Bank’s favor (including the issue of goodwill, amortization of which was claimed over the period of 10 years) or set-aside for re-examination by the ATIR.

The Bank as well as the tax department have filed Income Tax Reference Applications before Sindh High Court against above-mentioned order of ATIR, which are pending. Bank’s appeal for tax years 2018 to 2020 and 2022 are pending for adjudication before ATIR.

In respect of WWF, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in Judgement, PLD 2017 SC 28, that the amendments made in the WWF Ordinance through Finance Act, 2006 and 2008 were illegal and without lawful authority i.e. the banks do not fall into definition of Industrial Undertaking and thus, not liable to pay WWF. Based on that, the Appellate Tribunal through combined Appellate order dated January 31, 2022 has also annulled the OIR’s action of levying WWF on Bank under Worker’s Welfare Fund Ordinance, 1971 in tax years 2009, 2012 and 2013.

As a consequence of the 18th amendment to the Constitution, levy for the WWF was introduced by the Government of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan through the Sindh WWF Act, 2014 (the Act), the Punjab Workers Welfare Fund Act, 2019 and the Balochistan Workers Welfare Fund Act, 2022, respectively. As per these Acts, the Bank is liable to pay WWF in these provinces. However, in this respect:

- The Bank has challenged the issue of jurisdiction claimed by Sindh Revenue Board before the Honorable High Court of Sindh (SHC) on grounds that banking companies cannot be considered as industrial establishment and that the Act cannot be applied to trans-provincial entities. The Court has restrained the Sindh Revenue Board to collect / recover Sindh WWF. For TY 2018 to TY 2023 the Court granted stay from recovery of Sindh WWF upon submission of Bank Guarantee to Nazir of Court.
- The Bank has also received notices regarding the recovery of Balochistan WWF for which the Bank is in discussion with legal counsel to challenge in the court of law on same grounds as in case of Sindh WWF.

In 2018, Based on decision of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Bank had reassessed the provision of WWF which was previously held on the entire operating results of the Bank (including all provinces, part of Pakistan, AJK and Bahrain Operations) and maintained WWF only to the extent of its operations within Sindh Province till 2019. In 2020 after promulgation of Punjab WWF, the Bank has again decided prudently to maintain provision on the entire results of the Bank.

The Sindh High Court has dismissed the Bank’s petitions for tax years 2016 through 2022 wherein the Bank along with other taxpayers challenged the levy of super tax on constitutional grounds. Based on the opinion of legal counsel, the Bank has file appeal before the Supreme Court against the decision of the Sindh High Court. The Supreme Court has allowed interim relief to the taxpayers subject to the payment of 50% of the super tax liability. However, the Bank has adjusted full amount of super tax liability for Tax year 2016 and 2019 against the available tax refunds. Further, the bank has obtained stay from the Sindh High Court on other technical grounds regarding the levy of Super Tax for tax years 2017 and 2018.

Through Finance Act 2023, Super tax on high earning persons was levied under section 4C. The Bank has challenged the levy of Super tax for tax year 2023 through the legal counsel before the Islamabad High Court wherein interim stay was granted.

In pursuance of SRO 1588(I)/2023 dated November 21, 2023 banking companies have been designated to the 'sector' for the purpose of section 99D of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, for the years 2022 and 2023. Tax authorities issued a recovery notice to the Bank thereby creating a demand. The Bank through its legal council challenged the levy, and the High Court of Sindh, has decided the case against the Bank. However, the Islamabad High Court and Lahore High Court has suspended the operation of section 99D in other similar petitions. The Bank has decided to file petition against the said levy in the Supreme Court of Pakistan along with the stay application.

# 34.3.1 Income tax

Except for tax year 2009, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020 - and 2021 - income tax assessments have been filed and are deemed to have been assessed under the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (the Ordinance) unless selected by taxation authorities for audit purposes.

For tax year 2009, an ITRA no. 07/2013 was filed by the Commissioner, Inland Revenue against an order passed by the Learned Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) in ITA no. 923/KB/2011 dated August 28, 2012, which was related to the apportionment of expenses, allowability of expenses and claiming of tax deducted at source aggregating to Rs. 61.16 million. However, the same is pending for decision before the Sindh High Court (SHC).

For tax year 2015, an order dated November 23, 2016, was passed under section 4B of the Ordinance by the Deputy Commissioner Inland Revenue (DCIR). Through said order, an income of Rs.810.584 million was computed under section 4B of the Ordinance and resultant demand for super tax of Rs. 24.318 million was raised. An appeal was filed against the above order before CIR-A on December 01, 2016, identifying various errors/details not considered. The CIR-A has confirmed DCIR’s order vide his order dated May 30, 2017. In pursuance of the order of CIR-A, the Company has filed an appeal before ATIR along with an application for a stay against recovery of demand. The appeal before ATIR has been heard and the order is reserved whilst ATIR vide order dated July 18, 2017, has granted a stay for 60 days and subsequently, the said stay was further extended vide various orders by ATIR. Subsequently, recovery of aforesaid tax demand was previously stayed by the Honorable Sindh High Court (SHC) through C.P No 4915 of 2018 vide order dated June 28, 2018, with direction to the Department not to enforce recovery of tax demand till the decision of ATIR. However, based on its order dated July 21, 2020, the SHC has dismissed the aforementioned C.P and has declared the super tax for TY 2015 to be constitutionally vires. The Company has however filed an Income Tax Reference Application (ITRA) No. 52 of 2020 before SHC which is pending adjudication.

For tax year 2016 and 2017, notices dated December 27, 2016 and January 3, 2018 were issued under section 4B of the Ordinance by the DCIR. In the said notices, the DCIR has contended that the Company is liable to pay Super Tax amounting to Rs. 24.483 million and Rs. 19.490 million on ‘income’ of Rs. 816.122 million and Rs. 649.676 million for Tax Years 2016 and 2017 respectively. The Company has challenged both notices through writ petition before SHC on constitutional grounds wherein the SHC has, vide its orders dated January 16, 2017 and January 11, 2018 for Tax Years 2016 and 2017 respectively, has stated that no coercive action shall be taken against the Company. The DCIR passed the orders under section 4B vide order dated April 23, 2018 and May 4, 2018 for tax years 2016 and 2017 respectively to levy Super tax of above-mentioned amounts under the view that SHC has not restrained the department from passing the orders. In pursuance of the said orders, the Company filed appeals which CIR-A rejected vide its order dated October 12, 2018 for both years. As a result, the Company has filed appeals before the Appellant Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) against the orders of CIR-A. Meanwhile, the Company paid 50% of tax demand of both tax years to maintain the above suits in light of the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan (Civil Appeals No. 1171/2017 and other connected appeals) wherein, the pending suits are declared to be entertained on the condition that a minimum of 50% of tax demand is deposited with tax authorities during the pendency of the appeal. During the year the appeal has been heard before ATIR and is reserved in order. The Company has, however, filed an Income Tax Reference Application (ITRA) No. 53 and 54 of 2020 before SHC which is pending adjudication.

For tax year 2018, a notice under section 4B of the Ordinance by the DCIR dated December 7, 2018, was issued, contending that the Company is liable to pay Super Tax amounting to Rs. 45.211 million in ‘income’ of Rs. 1,507.039 million. The Company had challenged the notice on constitutional grounds before SHC through C.P. No. 8670 of 2018. The SHC, vide its order dated December 14, 2018, had stated that no coercive action shall be taken against the Company. However, the SHC based on its order issued in September 2020 has dismissed the aforementioned C.P. The Company is hence awaiting the conclusion of ATIR on the above matter before it files a reference application for TY 2018. To date, no order has been passed by the Department, consequently, no outstanding tax demand exists to date.

For tax year 2016, an amended assessment order has been passed under section 122(5A) of the Ordinance by the Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue (ACIR). Through the said order, the ACIR raised demand amounting to Rs. 241.217 million. Upon appeal filed, CIR-A confirmed the ACIR’s order vide its order dated December 12, 2017. In pursuance of the order of CIR-A, the Company had filed an appeal before ATIR. During last year ATIR vide its order dated March 29, 2019, had annulled ClRA's action on confirming disallowances made in the order passed by ACIR dated November 02, 2017, with directions to CIRA to pass speaking and reasoned order after providing due opportunity of being heard. As a result, the likely assessment position after the appeal effect of ATIR's order under section 124 of the Ordinance is that only tax demand on account of undistributed reserves is outstanding, which has also been stayed by SHC vide interim order in CP No. 0-2343 of 2019 dated April 09, 2019. Furthermore, during last year, a rectification application was filed for erroneously considered share premium reserves while computing excess reserves under section 5A of the Ordinance by the AClR, in its order dated November 2, 2017. As a result, tax demand under section 5A would be reduced to Rs. 7.523 million. The Hon’ble Sindh High Court vide an interim order dated May 21, 2021, granted relief against the said notice.

The Company has been selected for an income tax audit under section 214C. as per the amendment order passed on June 28, 2023, via letter AT 238 dated July 17, 2023 a reduction in the refund amount has been imposed due to certain expense adjustments. However, the organization has duly filed an appeal with CIRA and is currently awaiting a decision.

Resulted appeal effect order reflects refund of Rs.29 million. The tax authorities have filed an appeal before ATIR against said order of CIR (Appeals) in respect of deletion of addition regarding the portion of capital gain included in dividend. The ATIR vide order dated December 07, 2016 set-aside with the direction that the ACIR should examine the issue in the light of FBR Circular letter dated September 10, 2002.

The Bank has filed appeals before Commissioner Appeal, SRB which are pending adjudication. Furthermore, the Bank is contesting the issuance of certain showcause notices issued by SRB for the period covering from January 2012 till December 2013 before the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan based on the ground that these notices are time barred. The subject matter is also pending adjudication.

In respect of Tax Year 2019 and 2020, the ACIR under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 amended the return submitted by the Bank by adding / disallowing certain expenses thereby creating a Tax demand of Rs 1.247 billion.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

The defunct KASB Bank has been in receipt of two notices pertaining to tax year 2006 and tax year 2008 from FBR where FBR demanded unpaid tax liabilities on profit on debt paid amounting Rs 121.7 million and Rs 308 million respectively in FY 2013. The Bank challenged the issuance of such notice in High Court of Sindh vide CP D-371 of 2013 where the case was decided on the grounds that the notice has been issued beyond the time limit and therefore stands void. FBR being aggrieved to such decision challenged it in the Supreme Court of Pakistan where the case was remanded back by the Court to the concerned Commissioner for starting denovo proceedings. Subsequently, the notice was re-issued in 2020 again by the department under denovo proceedings which was subsequently challenged before Commissioner Appeals and Appellate Tribunal where the latter remanded back the matter to the FBR. The FBR has re-issued notices in the subject case in October 2024 under denovo proceedings. The Bank in its best interest has submitted records in the subject case on the recommendation of the tax consultant and subsequently received orders against these proceedings for Rs 6,138,408/- for tax year 2006 and Rs 10,057,474/- for tax year 2008 on December 31, 2024.

BankIslami received income tax monitoring notices for the periods from tax year 2017 through tax year 2023, covering a total of seven tax years which were received since 2019. The notices required a reconciliation of tax on financial statement components comprising of administrative expenses, fixed assets and profit on debt paid with the taxes paid with FBR. The Bank has submitted the necessary records to FBR including reconciliation of such expenses with the taxes reported in FBR. Subsequently the Bank received showcause notices and orders for the tax years 2017 to Tax year 2021 for Rs 70,429,491 inclusive of penalty and default surcharge. The Bank has preferred appeals before CIRA for tax year 2019 to tax year 2021. The management, based on the opinion of its tax advisor, is confident about the favorable outcome of the above matters.

# 38 DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN

# 38.1 General description

The Holding Company operates a recognised gratuity fund for all employees who opted for this scheme introduced by the management with effect from January 01, 2007.

Permanent employees are eligible for the gratuity fund after 10 years of continuous service. Gratuity is payable at 65% of the last drawn basic salary per completed year of service.

The defined benefit is administered by a separate fund that is legally separate from the Holding Company. The plan is governed by the trust deed dated September 01, 2007. The trustees of the gratuity fund are composed of representatives from employers. The trustees of the gratuity fund are required by the trust deed to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme, i.e. active employees, inactive employees, retirees and employers. The trustees of the gratuity fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.

The present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in this consolidated statement of financial position.

---

## Chunk 536

# 38.2 The plan in Pakistan typically exposes the Bank to actuarial risks such as:

- Salary increase risk: The risk that the final salary at the time of cessation of services is greater than assumed. Since the benefit is calculated on the final salary (which will closely reflect inflation and other macroeconomic factors), the benefit amount increases as salary increases.
- Discount rate risk: The discount rate is based on the yield on government bonds. If the market yield of bonds varies, the discount rate would vary in the same manner and would affect the present value of obligation and fair value of assets.
- Demographic Risks:
- Withdrawal risk: The risk of actual withdrawals experience is different from assumed withdrawal probability. The significance of the withdrawal risk varies with the age, service and the entitled benefits of the beneficiary.
- Longevity Risk: The risk that the actual mortality experience is different than the assumed mortality. This effect is more pronounced in schemes where the age and service distribution is on the higher side.
- Investment risk: This is the risk that the assets are under-performing and are not sufficient to meet the liabilities.

# 38.3 Number of employees under the scheme

The number of employees covered under the gratuity scheme are: 4,131 (2023: 4,010).

# 42. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities
classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and
subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial
statements. Fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities and fixed term deposits cannot be
calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding
market rates for similar instruments.

# 42.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the
measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e.
unobservable inputs).

The table below analyzes financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into
which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of fair values within level 2

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Units of mutual funds|Fair values of investments in units of mutual funds are determined based on redemption prices disclosed at the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) as at the close of the business days.|
|Market Treasury Bills (MTB), Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIB) and GoP Sukuks|Fair values of Pakistan Investment Bonds and Market Treasury Bills are derived using PKRV, PKFRV and PKISRV rates.|
|Debt Securities (TFCs) and Sukuk other than Government|Investments in debt securities (comprising of Term Finance Certificates, Bonds and any other security issued by a company or a body corporate for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the SECP.|
|Overseas Government Sukuks and Euro Bonds|The fair value of Overseas Government Sukuks, and Overseas Bonds are valued on the basis of price available on Bloomberg.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the foreign exchange revaluation rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
|Derivatives|The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currencies involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration, etc.|
|Property and Equipment - Land and buildings|Land and buildings and Non-banking assets under satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values as disclosed in note 10 and 13 of these consolidated financial statements. The valuations are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of State Bank of Pakistan. The valuation experts used a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank’s properties. The market approach used prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties.|

# 47. RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk Management is a discipline at the core of every financial institution and encompasses all the activities that affect its risk profile. At the Bank, it involves identification, measurement, monitoring and controlling risks to ensure that:

- The individuals who take or manage risks clearly understand it;
- The Bank's Risk exposure is within the limits established by Board of Directors (BoD);
- Risk taking decisions are in line with the business strategy and objectives set by BoD;
- The expected payoffs compensate for the risks taken;
- Risk taking decisions are explicit and clear;
- Sufficient capital as a buffer is available to take risk; and
- Risk management function is independent of risk taking unit.

The Bank has a comprehensive set of Risk Management Policies, practices and procedures which enables the Bank to take into consideration, in an appropriate manner, all major kinds of risks mainly credit, market, liquidity, operational and IT security risks. Keeping in view the dynamics of internal and external environment, we regularly review and update our Risk Management policies and procedures in accordance with regulatory environment and international standards.

Risk Management activities remain at the forefront of all activities of the Bank which places the highest priority on conducting its business in a prudent manner in line with the relevant laws and regulatory requirements.

Risk management framework of the Bank includes:

- Clearly defined risk management policies and procedures covering risk identification, acceptance, measurement, monitoring, reporting and control;
- Well constituted organizational structure, defining clearly roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in risk taking as well as managing it. The Bank, in addition to risk management functions for various risk categories, has instituted an Integrated Risk Management Committee (IRMC), Portfolio Management Committee (PMC), Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC), Remedial Management Committee (RMC) as well as Central Credit Committee (CCC). IRMC oversees the overall risk management at the Bank and provides guidance in setting strategic targets as well as concentration limits and monitor progress related to earnings growth, keeping in view the capital constraints and also adheres to the concentration limits. The IRMC monitors the strategic target and aggregate limits at the Business Group level and concentration limits (by industry, geography, size, tenor) so that one category of assets or dimension of risk cannot materially harm the performance of the Bank. PMC monitors the advances portfolio, concentrations limits, aggregate limits at business level and various house keeping elements under Credit Administration. ORMC oversees the effectiveness of operational risk management for maintenance and implementation of operational risk management framework. It also monitors the Business Continuity Planning and reviews findings of any other management or board's sub committee. Remedial Management Committee (RMC) oversees the progress of non performing loans and cases under litigation along with the recommendation of transferring of any NPL to Corporate Restructuring Company (CRC). Whereas, Central Credit Committee (CCC) is entrusted with the responsibility of monitoring lending risk profile of the Bank. CCC meets regularly to actively supervise credit risk across its lending portfolio;
- An effective management information system that ensures flow of information from operational level to top management and a system to address any exceptions observed; and
- A mechanism to ensure an ongoing review of systems, policies and procedures for risk management and procedures to adopt changes.

- The nature and characteristics of the risks undertaken; and
- The possible spread of risk situations across organizational units, assets-at-risk, and future time horizons.

Risk appetite drives business activity. It combines anticipations in risk and profitability with management preferences to control capital and resource allocation, as well as the distribution of exposure across activities and portfolios. The Bank's hedging strategy is embedded in its risk management practices for addressing material categories of risk.

# 47.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk which arises with the possibility that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge its obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. Credit risk is managed in terms of credit policies, approved by the BoD and regulations issued by the SBP. The Group is exposed to credit risk on loans and advances, fund placements with financial institutions and certain investments.

Credit risk management is an ongoing process. The overall credit policy and the credit risk instructions are issued by the Board of Directors. In this regards, a Central Credit Committee (CCC) is entrusted with the responsibility of monitoring lending risk profile of the bank. In order to maintain healthy growth of the credit portfolio, the Bank’s Credit Risk Management processes are consistently upgraded and improved to meet future challenges.

The Bank’s strategy is to minimize credit risk through product, geography, industry and customer diversification. Credit limits are established for all counter-parties after a careful assessment of their credit worthiness. An effective credit granting procedure, which requires pre-sanction evaluation of credit proposal, adequacy of security and pre-disbursement examination of charge documents is in place and managed by Credit Risk Group (CRG), Risk Management Group (RMG) & Credit Administration Department (CAD). The Bank maintains a sound portfolio diversified in nature to counter the risk of credit concentration and further confines risk through diversification of its assets by geographical and industrial sector. For managing impaired assets in the portfolio, the Bank follows the Prudential Regulations and Risk Management guidelines issued by SBP and the Remedial Management Policy approved by the Board.

# 47.1.1 Credit risk: Standardised Approach

The Bank has adopted the Standardised Approach of Basel II for risk weighing its Credit Risk Exposures. The following table illustrates the approved External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) whose ratings are being utilised by the Bank with respect to material categories of exposures:

|Exposures|VIS|PACRA|MOODY'S|FITCH|S&P|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Corporate|-|-|-|-|-|
|Banks|-|-|-|-|-|
|SME's (retail exposures)|-|-|-|-|-|
|Sovereigns| | | | | |
|Securitisations|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|

The Bank has used Issue Specific Ratings for rating / risk weighing Issue Specific Exposures and Entity Ratings for rating / risk weighing claims against specific counterparties. Both short and long term ratings have been used to rate corresponding short and long term exposures. For this purpose, Mapping Grid has been provided by SBP as given below:

# 47.2.2  Foreign Exchange Risk

Main objective of foreign exchange risk management is to ensure that the foreign exchange exposure of the Group lies within the defined appetite of the Group.

Daily reports are generated to monitor the internal and regulatory limits with respect to the overall foreign currency exposures. The overall net open position, whether short or long has the potential to negatively impact the profit and loss depending upon the direction of movement in foreign exchange rates.

Foreign exchange open and mismatched positions are marked to market on a daily basis.

Currency risk arises where the value of financial instruments changes due to changes in foreign exchange rates. In order to manage currency risk exposure the bank enters into ready / spot, forward and swap transactions with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and in the interbank market. The Group's foreign exchange exposure comprises of forward contracts, foreign currencies cash in hand, balances with banks abroad, foreign placement with SBP and foreign currencies assets and liabilities. The net open position is managed within the statutory limits, as fixed by SBP. Counter parties limit are also fixed to limit risk concentration. Appropriate segregation of duties exists between the front and back office functions while compliance with the net open position limit is independently monitored on an ongoing basis.

# 47.2.3  Equity position Risk

Equity positions in the banking book include Investment in equities that are available-for-sale or held for strategic investment purposes. These investments are generally regarded as riskier relative to fixed income securities owing to the inherent volatility of stock market prices. The Group mitigates these risks through diversification and capping maximum exposures in a single company, compliance with regulatory requirement, and following the guidelines laid down in the Group’s Investment Policy as set by the Board of Directors (BoD). The Bank follows a delivery versus payment settlement system thereby minimizing risk available in relation to settlement risk.

Equity price risk is managed by applying Portfolio level limits and scrip-wise stop loss monitoring.

# 47.3 Mismatch of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in the market interest rates. The Group is exposed to interest / mark-up rate risk as a result of mismatches or gaps in the amount of interest / mark up based assets and liabilities that mature or re-price in a given period. The Group manages this risk by matching / re-pricing of assets and liabilities. The assets and liabilities committee (ALCO) of the Bank monitors and manages the interest rate risk with the objective of limiting the potential adverse effects on the profitability of the Group.

# 47.4 Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to raise funds to meet its commitments. The Bank's Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) manages the liquidity position on a continuous basis.

The Group's policy for liquidity management is to maintain adequate liquidity at all times and in all currencies under both normal and stress conditions, to meet its contractual and potential payment obligations without incurring additional and unacceptable cost to the business.

Treasury is responsible for the managing liquidity risk under the guidance of Asset-Liability Committee of the Group. The Group's liquidity risk management approach starts at the intraday level (operational liquidity) managing the daily payments queue and factoring in our access to the qualifying securities of State Bank of Pakistan. It then covers tactical liquidity risk management dealing with the access to unsecured funding sources and the liquidity characteristics of our asset inventory (asset liquidity). Finally, the strategic perspective comprises the maturity profile of all assets and liabilities on our statement of financial position.

For monitoring and controlling liquidity risk, the Group generates a scenario sensitive maturity statement of financial position, and run controlled mismatches that are monitored and discussed by ALCO members regularly. The Group prepares various types of reports and analysis for assisting ALCO in taking necessary strategic actions for managing liquidity risk in the Group. These include liquidity ratios, Concentration analysis, Gap reports, Stress testing, Liquidity Coverage ratio & Net Stable Funding Ratio analysis etc.

Based on December 31, 2024 numbers LCR is 257.13%. against SBP minimum requirement of 100%, with Total Stock of High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) of Rs. 517,736.2 million and Net Cash Outflows of Rs. 201,355 million.

Furthermore, Based on December 31, 2024 numbers the NSFR is 200.86% against SBP minimum requirement of 100%, with Total Available Stable Funding of Rs. 1,060,751 million and Total Required Stable Funding of Rs. 528,103 million.

The Group strategically emphasizes diversification and stability in its funding approach. Its funding base is varied, encompassing stable sources like equity, subordinated loans, retail and small business deposits, and less stable forms such as deposits from larger entities. It is fully compliant with Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), ensuring an ample supply of high-quality liquidity assets relative to liabilities.

The Group employs stress testing to assess its balance sheet's vulnerability to hypothetical stress events. Liquidity risk factors undergo significant shocks, and their impact on the balance sheet is quantified. Stress testing encompasses scenarios defined by both regulatory standards and internally identified risks. Results are communicated to senior management, the Board of Directors, and regulators.

A Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) is in place to address liquidity challenges during crises. CFP identifying stress scenarios and corresponding funding plans, incorporating early warning indicators. Three Contingency Levels are defined in CFP with varying action Plans for each.

The Liquidity Coverage Ratio's (LCR) key drivers include High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) and Net Cash Outflow, determined by asset liquidity quality and liability profile volatility. The composition of HQLA as of December 31, 2024, is detailed as below:

|Level 1 Assets:|Rs. 518,128 billion|
|---|---|
|Level 2 Assets:|Rs. 2,410 billion|
