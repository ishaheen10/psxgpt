## Chunk 1

# Economy

At the start of the fiscal year (FY)24, Pakistan faced an imminent economic crisis stemming from surging world commodity prices, global monetary tightening, catastrophic flooding in 2022, and political uncertainty. Persistent fiscal and external imbalances led to pressures on domestic prices, increasing debt, Rupee depreciation, and sharp reductions in foreign reserves. As a result, import and capital management measures were imposed which disrupted domestic supply chain leading to further inflationary pressures, and weakening economic activity.

A Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) was entered into with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in July 2023. Besides stabilizing the economy, the SBA also improved foreign funding flows thus allowing for relaxation in import management measures.

Owing to a mild pickup in exports and lower import bill, Trade Deficit was recorded at US$13.5 billion in 8MFY24 (down 28% YoY). Despite a stagnant remittance flow, sharp reduction in Trade Deficit helped bringing down the Current Account Deficit to US$0.9 billion from US$3.8 billion in the same period last year. Moreover, FX Reserves have also more than doubled in the same period (to US$7.9 billion). As a result, PKR has also been showing stability against the US$.

With stable currency and the effect of a high base last year, the country entered into a disinflation phase as CPI for 1QCY24 averaged 24%, compared to 31.5% during 1QCY23. In both its Monetary Policy meetings, however, SBP’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) remained cautious and kept the Policy Rate unchanged at 22%. Additionally, the secondary market that had started pricing in a possible rate cut, witnessed a rebound. Yields however remained below the Policy Rate, aligning with the SBP's view of the economy entering into a positive interest rate zone based on forward-looking expectations.

In its recent outlook, the IMF has maintained Pakistan’s economic growth prospects for the current fiscal year at 2%, which is marginally higher than the World Bank’s forecast at 1.8%, albeit significantly lower than the government’s target of 3.5%. Tighter Monetary and Fiscal policies, continued external headwinds, and domestic policy uncertainty are expected to weigh on economic growth in the medium term. Nonetheless, the government seems committed to carry out aggressive reforms to stabilise the economy, including measures for broadening the tax net, privatising SOEs, expanding social safety nets and facilitating the private sector.

## Chunk 2

# Banking sector review

The banking sector’s weighted average spreads remain stable during most of the quarter, closer to 7%. During the same time, while SBP kept the Policy Rate unchanged at 22% during 1QCY24, secondary market yields and KIBOR remained below the Policy Rate with the yield curve remaining inverted, leading to pressure on margins.

During the quarter, banking sector deposits touched PKR 28.3 trillion in March (up 20% YoY), where the preferred asset remained Investments. Gross ADR levels further reduced to 42% in March as demand for credit remained subdued in an all-time high-interest rate environment. The sector’s loan book expanded by 3% YoY only. With that, the trend of Non-Performing Loans has also increased of late, where the stock has increased to PKR 995 billion as of Dec-2023, adding PKR 30 billion during 4QCY23 alone. This, however, depicts a stable infection ratio of 8% at December end.

## Chunk 3

# Performance overview

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Bank reported a Profit Before Tax of PKR 3,721 million (Profit after Tax of PKR 1,708 million), as compared to a Profit before Tax of PKR 1,526 million (Profit after Tax of PKR 856 million) during the corresponding period last year. This represents a YoY growth of 144% in terms of PBT and 99% in terms of PAT. During this period, the Bank’s Net Interest Income increased by 39% YoY primarily owing to an improvement in the Bank’s deposit mix, as non-remunerative deposit averages improved from PKR 131.7 Bn in Q1’23 to PKR 152.3 Bn in Q1’24 (YoY growth of ~15.6%). Moreover, growth of 25% in markup income outpaced the growth in markup expenses of 21%. This is despite the pressure on margins in Q1 2024, as secondary market yields adjusted in anticipation of rate cuts while funding costs remained stagnant. As a result, NII increased to PKR 7,008 million (up 39% YoY).

At the end of the first quarter of 2024, the Bank achieved the milestone of crossing half a trillion deposits to close the quarter at PKR 514 billion. This achievement is testimony to the confidence and trust reposed in the Bank by our valued customers and the dedicated efforts of our teams.

The Bank’s non-markup income increased by 68% YoY to PKR 3,714 million, with improvements across all lines. Foreign Exchange Income, however, remained subdued as exchange rates remained relatively more stable as compared to the same period last year. Resultantly, total income grew by 48% YoY to PKR 10,722 million.

Operating expenses witnessed an increase of 26% YoY mainly on account of inflationary and exchange rate pressures impacting technology and other costs. However, with increase in revenues outpacing that in costs, the Bank’s operating cost-to-income ratio improved to 57.9% as compared to 67.8% during the corresponding period last year.

As per the SBP's BPRD Circular Letter no. 7 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments became effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2024 for Banks. Accordingly, the Bank’s financial statements for the current reporting period have been prepared in accordance with SBP’s revised format for interim financial statements and other directives regarding the accounting framework for classification and measurement of financial instruments.

Based on the provisioning requirements under the new standard as well as additional provisions made in the current quarter, the Bank’s NPL Coverage Ratio (including the impact of expected credit losses on loans classified as non-performing (under Stage III) has improved to 64.3% (December 31, 2023: 59.7%). For Capital Adequacy purposes, the SBP’s final implementation guidelines include a transitional arrangement for recognition of new provisions arising out of first-time implementation of the standard, which the Bank has considered.

# Bank’s Capital Adequacy Ratio as at March 31, 2024

has been reported at 13.38% (December 31, 2023: 12.53%).

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2024

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017, or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IFRS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

These condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required for annual unconsolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ and International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, ‘Investment Property’ for banking companies vide BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002 till further instructions. Further, the SECP has deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ on banks vide its notification S.R.O 411(I)/2008 dated April 28, 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements. However, investments have been classified and valued in accordance with the requirements prescribed by the SBP through various circulars.

International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 10, 'Consolidated Financial Statements', was made applicable from period beginning on or after January 01, 2015 vide S.R.O 633(I)/2014 dated July 10, 2014 by SECP. However, SECP has directed through S.R.O 56(I)/2016 dated January 28, 2016, that the requirement of consolidation under section 228 of the Companies Act, 2017 and IFRS 10, 'Consolidated Financial Statements' is not applicable in case of investment by companies in mutual funds established under trust structure. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.

# 4.1 Changes in accounting policies and transition disclosures

# 4.1.1 Impact of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Bank has opted for modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening retained earnings and other reserves at the beginning of the current year without restating the comparatives.

The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in the accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 also significantly amends other standards dealing with financial instruments such as IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.

Number of shares to be issued to TFC holders at the time of conversion will be equal to the ‘Outstanding Value of the TFCs’ divided by market value per share of the Bank’s common / ordinary share on the date of the PONV trigger event as declared by SBP, subject to the cap specified below:|
| |The PONV trigger event is the earlier of:|
| |- A decision made by SBP that a conversion or temporary / permanent write-off is necessary without which the Issuer would become non-viable;|
| |- The decision to make a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, without which the Issuer would have become non-viable, as determined by SBP.|
| |- The maximum number of shares to be issued to TFC holders at the PST and / or PONV (or otherwise as directed by SBP) will be subject to a specified cap of 329,595,476 ordinary shares, or such other number as may be agreed to in consultation with SBP.|

# 37. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 13, 'Fair Value Measurement' defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. Fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities and fixed term deposits cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since assets and liabilities are either short term in nature or in the case of customer loans and deposits are frequently repriced.

---

## Chunk 60

# Fair value hierarchy

IFRS 13 requires the Bank to classify fair value measurement using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has following levels:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

---

## Chunk 61

# 37.1 Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level:

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Financial Instruments - Level 1| |
|Shares of listed companies|Fair values of investments in listed equity securities are valued on the basis of closing quoted market prices available at the Pakistan Stock Exchange / Bloomberg.|
|Financial instruments - Level 2| |
|Mutual fund units|Fair values of investments in mutual fund units are determined based on redemption prices disclosed at the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) as at the close of the business days.|
|Market Treasury Bills (MTB), Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIB) and GoP Sukuks|Fair values of Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills and GoP Sukuks are derived using PKRV, PKFRV and PKISRV rates.|
|Debt Securities (TFCs) and Sukuk other than Government|Investments in debt securities (comprising of Term Finance Certificates, Bonds and any other security issued by a company or a corporate body for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the SECP.|
|Overseas Government Sukuks, Overseas and Euro Bonds|The fair value of Overseas Government Sukuks, and Overseas & Euro Bonds are valued on the basis of price available on Bloomberg.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the foreign exchange revaluation rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
|Derivatives|The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currencies involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration, etc.|
|Financial instruments - Level 3|Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.|

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and, unavailability of reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

---

## Chunk 62

# Non-Financial assets - Level 3

Fixed assets and Non-banking assets under satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values as disclosed in note 11 and 14 of these consolidated financial statements. The valuations are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of State Bank of Pakistan. The valuation experts used a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank’s properties. The market approach used prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties.

These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.

# 37. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 13, 'Fair Value Measurement' defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. Fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities and fixed term deposits cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since assets and liabilities are either short term in nature or in the case of customer loans and deposits are frequently repriced.

---

## Chunk 142

# Fair value hierarchy

IFRS 13 requires the Group to classify fair value measurement using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has following levels:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

---

## Chunk 143

# 37.1 Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level:

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Financial Instruments - Level 1|Shares of listed companies: Fair values of investments in listed equity securities are valued on the basis of closing quoted market prices available at the Pakistan Stock Exchange / Bloomberg.|
|Financial instruments - Level 2|Mutual fund units: Fair values of investments in mutual fund units are determined based on redemption prices disclosed at the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) as at the close of the business days.|
| |Market Treasury Bills (MTB), Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIB) and GoP Sukuks: Fair values of Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills and GoP Sukuks are derived using PKRV, PKFRV and PKISRV rates.|
| |Debt Securities (TFCs) and Sukuk other than Government: Investments in debt securities (comprising of Term Finance Certificates, Bonds and any other security issued by a company or a corporate body for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the SECP.|
| |Overseas Government Sukuks, Overseas and Euro Bonds: The fair value of Overseas Government Sukuks, and Overseas & Euro Bonds are valued on the basis of price available on Bloomberg.|
| |Forward foreign exchange contracts: The valuation has been determined by interpolating the foreign exchange revaluation rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
| |Derivatives: The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currencies involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration, etc.|
|Financial instruments - Level 3|Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.|

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and, unavailability of reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

---

## Chunk 144

# Non-Financial assets - Level 3

Fixed assets - Land and building: Fixed assets and Non-banking assets under satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values as disclosed in note 11 and 14 of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements. The valuations are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of State Bank of Pakistan. The valuation experts used a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank’s properties. The market approach used prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these consolidated financial statements.
