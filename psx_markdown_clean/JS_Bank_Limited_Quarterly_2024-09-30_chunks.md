## Chunk 3

# Economic Review

Pakistan's current economic indicators have continued to show signs of improvement, and over the course of the third quarter of 2024, economic stability has further solidified. With the IMF Executive Board acknowledging that Pakistan has taken key steps to restoring economic stability with consistent policy implementation, a 37-month Extended Fund Facility Arrangement (EFF) for USD 7 billion, with immediate disbursement of about USD 1 billion was secured during the period. This has helped in further supplementing the country’s foreign exchange reserves, which reached a 26-month high of USD 9.5 Billion in September 2024. The arrangement is expected to pave the way for further financial support through bilateral and multilateral partners.

The current account deficit has narrowed significantly, even turning into a surplus in August due to increased remittances and a decline in imports. Exports rose 7 percent year-on-year (YoY), while imports increased by 14 percent. Remittances from overseas Pakistanis surged by 44 percent YoY during the same period. Growth in real GDP; contained current account deficit; robust workers’ remittances; improvement in foreign exchange reserves; and stability in Pakistan Rupee to US Dollar parity are expected to continue in the coming months.

Inflation rate in Pakistan eased to the lowest reading since January 2021. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) continued its monetary easing cycle, reducing interest rates cumulatively by 300bps in July and September to 17.5 percent. This decision was supported by a faster-than-expected decline in inflation pace, which averaged 9.2 percent in 3QCY24 (down from 29 percent in the same period last year).

In recognition of these positive developments, Moody's Ratings upgraded Pakistan's government rating to Caa2 from Caa3, marking the first upgrade in nine years. The agency cited improved macroeconomic conditions, stronger government liquidity, and enhanced external positions.

During the period under review, FBR’s tax collections improved by 20.5 percent. Primary balance managed to post a surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP compared to 0.3 percent of GDP last year. Fiscal consolidation attained in the past couple of years is expected to continue through reforms aimed at broadening the tax base and effective management of Public Sector Entities (PSEs).

Going forward, Pakistan will require sound policies and reforms to support the ongoing efforts to strengthen macroeconomic stability, address deep structural challenges (including but not limited to the tax system, energy sector and PSEs), and create conditions for a stronger, more inclusive, and resilient growth and to put debt firmly on a downward trajectory. The IMF has appreciated the steps being taken toward a fairer tax system and has stressed the importance of additional revenue mobilization efforts by broadening the tax base and enhancing tax administration. It has also emphasized the significance of prudent spending management, which will create space for essential investments in human capital, infrastructure, and social protection.

## Chunk 4

# Banking sector review

While SBP continued monetary easing, with another 300bps cut in the Policy Rate in 3QCY24, secondary market yields simultaneously witnessed a sharper plummet. As a result, secondary market yields continued to trade below the Policy Rate throughout the quarter.

Banking spreads during Jul-Aug-2024 contracted to a 2-year low of 6.82 percent. Moreover, Aug-2024 witnessed a decline for the 6th consecutive month in KIBOR, indicating anticipation of further monetary easing.

During the same period, the Banking sector deposit growth remained relatively muted at PKR 30.8 trillion, expanding only by 1 percent MoM. On a YoY basis, deposit growth slightly receded from its recent momentum, and increased 18 percent YoY. This marked the lowest growth in the last 10 months. Advances remained below the PKR 12 trillion level (flat YoY), with ADR further reducing to 38 percent. ADR levels have dropped to the lowest since at least 2002. Investments, dominated by government securities, continued to grow, remaining above the PKR 30 trillion mark, and further taking IDR to a record high of 101 percent. The growth in investments continues to remain supported by Borrowings from SBP.

# Performance Review

The Bank posted Profit before tax (PBT) of PKR 6,208 million and Profit after tax (PAT) of PKR 3,100 million for the nine months ended 30 September 2024, as compared to PKR 4,671 million and PKR 2,321 million respectively for the comparative period last year. This represents a YoY growth of 33 percent in terms of PBT and 34 percent in terms of PAT.

During the period, the Bank’s Net Interest Income increased by 33 percent YoY, primarily owing to an improvement in the deposit mix, coupled with increased volumes. Non-Remunerative Deposits increased by PKR 29,246 million or 18 percent as against December 31, 2023, resulting in share of Non-Remunerative Deposits increasing to 37 percent from 33 percent at the year end.

During the period under review, margins continued to remain under pressure, as secondary market yields continually adjusted in anticipation of rate cuts while funding costs remained stagnant for the first six months of the year due to unchanged minimum deposit rates (MDR). The impact of the rate cuts has now started to take effect, but at the same time, the yields on offer continue to remain below the policy rate as well.

The Bank’s Non-Markup Income increased by 41 percent YoY to PKR 9,786 million with 11 percent growth from Fee Income, higher Dividends of PKR 2,025 million, as well as positive impact through net gains on securities of PKR 1,787 million year on year. Non mark-up Expenses increased by 27 percent YoY to PKR 20,049 million owing mainly due to inflationary adjustments, Rupee Depreciation and increase in technology based costs.

The Bank’s cost to income ratio improved to 68 percent from 73 percent for the corresponding period last year, while the Bank’s NII to Operating Cost Ratio was at 98 percent during the period under review. The Bank continues to target further improvement in both ratios to increase intermediation efficiency.

Period end Deposits were reported at PKR 518.735 billion. This translates to a growth of 7 percent against the December 31, 2023 position. As mentioned above, the Bank’s period end Non-Remunerative Deposits mix has improved to 37 percent. In terms of averages, the Bank’s average non-remunerative deposits improved from PKR 142.502 billion in 9M 2023 to PKR 154.947 billion in 9M 2024.

Period end Gross Advances ended at a level of PKR 280.220 billion as on September 30, 2024, up from PKR 213.787 billion in December 2023. As a result, the Bank’s Gross ADR level as at the period end inched up to 54 percent. The Bank’s Gross Infection Ratio remained at 7.63 percent in September 2024 (December 2023: 7.6 percent), as non-performing loans also increased to PKR 21.387 billion from PKR 16.184 billion in December 2023.

With increase in classified advances, the Bank booked an additional gross charge of PKR 2.168 billion (under Stage III) during the current quarter. The Bank’s coverage ratio stands at 65 percent as compared to 59.7 percent as on December 2023.

The Bank’s Capital Adequacy Ratio also improved to 13.72 percent as compared to 12.53 percent in December 2023.

## Chunk 33

# 4.1 Impact of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

During the period, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9, ‘Financial Instruments' became applicable to the Bank.

BPRD Circular No. 03 dated July 05, 2022 issued by SBP provides detailed instructions on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks. The SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 have made amendments and extend the timelines of IFRS 9 application instructions.

IFRS 9 addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘expected credit losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

## Chunk 34

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions from January 01, 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at January 01, 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard. Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9.

SBP wide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 have made amendments and extended timelines of application instructions. Under the new guidelines, the banks are allowed to use the existing practice for recognising markup income / expense on financial assets / liabilities up to September 30, 2024. However, banks shall ensure the recognition of markup income / expense on financial assets / liabilities on the effective interest rate method as per the IFRS 9 standard with effect from October 01, 2024. Further, the banks will apply modification accounting for financial assets and liabilities as per IFRS 9 standard and shall measure the subsidized staff financing, extended to their employees as per HR policies, at fair value as per the IFRS 9 standard with effect from October 01, 2024. Moreover, SBP has allowed an extension to Banks up to December 31, 2024 for developing the requisite models for calculating EAD for revolving products beyond the contractual date. In addition, the banks have also been allowed to cost existing practice of valuing unquoted equity investments at their cost or breakup value, whichever is lower, till December 31, 2024 and perform fair valuation of these securities afterwards.

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the banks, which has reduced their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the 'Application Instructions' issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement.

The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the transitional adjustment amount) must be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the transition period of five years.

The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the transitional adjustment amount) must be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the transition period of five years. Moreover, SBP has allowed to adjust the amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions in Tier 2 Capital that have not been added back to CET 1 and vice versa as per Annexure-A of BPRD Circular No. 16 dated July 29, 2024.

The impact of adoption of IFRS 9 on the capital ratios of the Bank are as follows:

| |As per previous reporting requirements|As per adoption of IFRS 9 impairment changes|IFRS 9 reclassification changes|
|---|---|---|---|
|Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Adequacy ratio|8.43%|8.11%|-0.32%|
|Tier 1 Capital Adequacy Ratio|9.65%|9.34%|-0.31%|
|Total Capital Adequacy Ratio|12.53%|12.09%|-0.44%|

# 4.1.5 Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) regardless of the business model in which they are held.

---

## Chunk 40

# 4.1.5.1 Recognition and initial measurement

Trade receivable and debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at transaction price.

---

## Chunk 41

# 4.1.5.2 Classification

(a) Financial Assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL. A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held-for-trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Bank changes its business models for managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following changes in the business model.

## Chunk 42

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

IFRS 9 allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any 'accounting mismatch' that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising gains and losses on them on different basis. SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout life of the instrument. Nonetheless, banks should avoid this option for financial instruments that are categorised as Level 3 in terms of the IFRS 13 hierarchy.

---

## Chunk 43

# (b) Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), when they are held-for-trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognised in profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method. Markup expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit and loss.

Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in scope of the standard are never bifurcated. Instead, the whole hybrid instrument is assessed for classification.

## Chunk 44

# 4.1.6 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either held-to-collect, held-to-collect and sale and others based on Business Model Assessment. The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The assessment requires judgement based on facts and circumstances on the date of assessment. The information considered mainly includes:

- the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual markup revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Bank’s management;
- the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and its strategy for how those risks are managed;
- how managers of the business are compensated (e.g., whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected); and
- the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case' scenarios into account. Transfer of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Bank continuing recognition of the financial assets. Financial assets that are held-for-trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held-to-collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

---

## Chunk 45

# 4.1.7 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as interest margin.

---

## Chunk 46

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Bank considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Bank considers:

- contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
- leverage features;
- prepayment and extension terms;
- terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and
- features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).

A prepayment feature is consistent with the SPPI criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and markup on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a discount or premium to its contractual par-amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.

The Bank holds a portfolio of long-term fixed-rate loan for which the Bank has the option to propose to revise the interest rate at periodic reset dates. These reset rights are limited to the market rate at the time of revision. The borrowers have an option to either accept the revised rate or redeem the financing at par without penalty. The Bank has determined that the contractual cash flows of these loan are SPPI because the option varies the interest rate in a way that is in consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic financing risks and costs associated with the principal amount outstanding.

## Chunk 47

# 4.1.8 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

|Financial assets at FVTPL|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any markup or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.|
|---|---|
|Financial assets at amortised cost|These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Markup, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.|
|Debt investments at FVOCI|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and is assessed for impairment under the new ECL model. Markup income is calculated using the effective interest method and includes amortisation of premiums and accretion of discount, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in income statement. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit and loss account.|
|Equity investments at FVOCI|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are adjusted from the carrying value of investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit and loss account.|

The banks are allowed to continue measuring unquoted equity securities at the lower of cost or break-up value up to December 31, 2024. However, Bank shall be required to measure unquoted equity securities at fair value, as required in the IFRS 9 application instructions, with effect from January 01, 2025.

## Chunk 48

# 4.1.9 Amortised cost and gross carrying amount

The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance (or impairment allowance before January 01, 2024).

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

---

## Chunk 49

# 4.1.10 Calculation of markup income and expense

Markup income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:

- the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or
- the amortised cost of the financial liability.

The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability.

In calculating markup income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, markup income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of markup income reverts to the gross basis.

For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, markup income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of markup income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves.

---

## Chunk 50

# 4.1.10.1 Presentation

Markup / interest earned as presented in the profit and loss account includes markup income calculated using the effective interest method as presented in sub note which includes:

- markup on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost; and
- markup on debt instruments measured at FVOCI;

Markup / interest expense as presented in the profit and loss account includes markup expense calculated using the effective interest rate method as presented in sub note which includes:

- financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

Markup income and expense on all trading assets and liabilities are considered to be incidental to the Bank’s trading operations and are presented together with all other changes in the fair value of trading assets and liabilities in net trading income.

Markup income and expense on other financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are presented in net income from other financial instruments at FVTPL.

Under IFRS 9 markup income earned on non-performing financial assets is determined by using the credit adjusted effective interest rate. However, in accordance with the application instructions the unrealised markup earned on non-performing assets are kept in a memorandum account and are not credited to the profit and loss account. However, the Banks are advised to recognise income on non-performing assets (loans classified under PRs i.e., OAEM and Stage 3 loan) on a receipt basis in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations issued by SBP.

# 4.1.11 Derecognition

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

---

## Chunk 51

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between:

- the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognized); and
- the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI shall be recognised in profit or loss.

From January 01, 2024 any cumulative gain / loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated at FVOCI is not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any markup on transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Bank is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its statement of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or a portion of them. In such cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised. Examples of such transactions are securities lending and sale-and-repurchase transactions.

When assets are sold to a third party with a concurrent total rate of return swap on the transferred assets, the transaction is accounted for as a secured loan transaction similar to sale-and-repurchase transactions, because the Bank retains all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of such assets.

In transactions in which the Bank neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Bank continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.

In certain transactions, the Bank retains the obligation to service the transferred financial asset for a fee. The transferred asset is derecognised if it meets the derecognition criteria. An asset or liability is recognised for the servicing contract if the servicing fee is more than adequate (asset) or is less than adequate (liability) for performing the servicing.

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

---

## Chunk 52

# 4.1.12 Modification

(a) Financial Assets

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of loans to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification are accounted for as follows:

- fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and
- other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.

If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

Where derecognition of financial assets is appropriate, the newly recognised residual loans are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classified as purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI).

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the bank first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognise the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred, and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the bank first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognise the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred, and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset. If such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as markup income calculated using the effective interest rate method.

---

## Chunk 54

# (b) Financial Liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability recognised and consideration paid is recognised in profit and loss account. Consideration paid includes non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability.

If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. For floating-rate financial liabilities, the original effective interest rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument.

---

## Chunk 55

# 4.1.13 Reclassification

Financial liabilities are not reclassified subsequent to initial recognition. Reclassifications of financial assets are made when, and only when, the business model for those assets changes. Such changes are expected to be infrequent and arise as a result of significant external or internal changes such as the termination of a line of business or the purchase of a subsidiary whose business model is to realise the value of pre-existing held for trading financial assets through a hold to collect model.

Financial assets are reclassified at their fair value on the date of reclassification and previously recognised gains and losses are not restated. Moreover, reclassifications of financial assets between financial assets held at amortised cost and financial assets held at FVOCI do not affect effective interest rate or expected credit loss computations.

---

## Chunk 56

# (a) Reclassified from amortised cost

Where financial assets held at amortised cost are reclassified to financial assets held at FVTPL, the difference between the fair value of the assets at the date of reclassification and the previously recognised amortised cost is recognised in the profit and loss account.

For financial assets held at amortised cost that are reclassified to FVOCI, the difference between the fair value of the assets at the date of reclassification and the previously recognised gross carrying value is recognised in comprehensive income. Additionally, the related cumulative expected credit loss amounts relating to the reclassified financial assets are reclassified from provisions to a separate reserve in comprehensive income at the date of reclassification.

---

## Chunk 57

# (b) Reclassified from fair value through other comprehensive income

Where debt securities held at FVOCI are reclassified to financial assets held at FVTPL, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in comprehensive income is transferred to the profit and loss account.

For debt securities held at FVOCI that are reclassified to financial assets held at amortised cost, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in comprehensive income is adjusted against the fair value of the financial asset such that the financial asset is recorded at a value as if it had always been held at amortised cost. In addition, the related cumulative expected credit losses held within comprehensive income are reversed against the gross carrying value of the reclassified assets at the date of reclassification.

---

## Chunk 58

# (c) Reclassified from fair value through profit or loss

Where financial assets held at FVTPL are reclassified to debt securities held at FVOCI or financial assets held at amortised cost, the fair value at the date of reclassification is used to determine the effective interest rate on the financial asset going forward. In addition, the date of reclassification is used as the date of initial recognition for the calculation of expected credit losses. Where financial assets held at FVTPL are reclassified to financial assets held at amortised cost, the fair value at the date of reclassification becomes the gross carrying value of the financial asset.

# 4.1.14 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (ECL) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (12-month ECL). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL).

---

## Chunk 60

# (a) Measurement of ECL

ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:

- financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive);
- financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows;
- undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive;
- financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Bank expects to recover.

---

## Chunk 61

# (b) Restructured financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows:

- If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset.
- If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in ‘Stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘Stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘Stage 3’.

---

## Chunk 62

# (c) Non-Performing financial assets

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit‑impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘non-performing’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- the restructuring of a loan by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.

Under the IFRS 9 Application instructions, the Bank is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. The Bank is required to calculate ECL on its non-performing financial assets as higher of provision under Prudential Regulations (PR) and ECL under IFRS 9.

The Bank calculates the ECL against corporate, commercial and SME loan portfolios as higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at borrower/facility level, whereas against the retail borrowers the Bank will calculate ECL at higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at segment/product basis as instructed under Annexure-A of BPRD Circular No. 16 dated July 29, 2024.

Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 and Application Instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

1. Probability of default (PD)
The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12 month ECL, Stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2). PD is estimated using internal rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk rating. The bank has used Transition Matrix approach for estimation of PD for each internal rating. The bank has used roll-rate method using the days past due (DPD) criteria to estimate PD for its retail portfolio. PD are then adjusted with forward looking information for calculation of ECL.
2. Exposure at default (EAD)
The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant. The Bank estimates EAD for financial assets carried at an amortised cost equal to principal plus profit. Each repayment date is assumed to be default point in the model and the ECL is calculated on EAD at each reporting date and discounted at the effective interest rate. Further, cash and cash equivalent collaterals the Bank holds against the non-retail facilities are adjusted from the EAD.
3. Loss given default (LGD)
An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

## Chunk 64

# 4.1.15 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and/or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PR issued by SBP. Financial assets in Stage 2 may be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum period of 6 months from initial downgrade is required before any facility is moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to move back from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it should meet the criteria defined under the respective Prudential Regulations for de-classification of account/facility. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular No. 3 dated July 05, 2022. However, banks are free to choose more stringent days past due criteria.

# FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

The Bank measures ECL on a lifetime basis for POCI instruments throughout the life of the instrument. However, ECL is not recognised in a separate loss provision on initial recognition for POCI instruments as the lifetime expected credit loss is inherent within the gross carrying amount of the instruments. The Bank recognises the change in lifetime expected credit losses arising subsequent to initial recognition in the profit and loss account and the cumulative change as a loss provision. Where lifetime ECL on POCI instruments are less than those at initial recognition, then the favorable differences are recognised as impairment gains in the profit and loss account.

## Chunk 66

# 4.1.16 Write-offs

Financial assets are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level.

Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in the profit and loss account and OCI.

Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Bank’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

## Chunk 67

# 4.1.17 Offsetting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

## Chunk 68

# 4.1.18 Undrawn loan commitments and guarantees:

‘Financial guarantees’ are contracts that require the Bank to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. ‘Loan commitments’ are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions.

Financial guarantees issued or commitments to provide a loan at a below-market profit rate are initially measured at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at the higher of the loss allowance determined in accordance with IFRS 9 and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.

When estimating lifetime ECL for undrawn loan commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the loans are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

## Chunk 69

# 4.1.19 Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank has adopted a governance framework requiring the Risk, Finance, Operations, Internal Audit and IT functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. IFRS 9 requires robust credit risk models that can predict Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD).

The Bank’s Risk Management Division has developed models / methodologies for PD, LGD and Credit Conversion Factors (CCF). These models are validated on an annual basis considering the following aspects:

- Quantitative Validation: Expected credit loss (ECL) model design validation, data quality validation and benchmarking with external best practices.
- Quantitative Validation: Calibration testing which ensures the accuracy of the observed PDs.

The Risk Department defines the staging criteria for the new impairment model and take ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach. Additionally, the Risk department also take the ownership of the impact of ECL on bank's capital.

The Bank’s Finance Division performs ECL calculation. As a result, the department then assess the financial impact, meet the financial reporting requirements and further monitor the impact on the financial ratios. Finance department also presents quarterly progress report to its relevant Board Sub Committee.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Derivative instruments, such as Futures, Cross Currency Swaps and Options, are forward transactions that provide market making opportunities / hedge against the adverse movement of interest and exchange rates. Derivatives business also provides risk solutions for the existing and potential customers of the Bank.

The Bank enters into a Cross Currency Swap transaction with its customer on back-to-back basis with an Authorized Derivative Dealer (ADD) without carrying any open position in its books. Specific approvals for the transactions have been granted by State Bank of Pakistan. Policies in line with SBP instructions have been formulated and are operative. The Bank also enters into Foreign Currency & Commodity Options from its Wholesale Banking Branch Bahrain for market making activities. These transactions cover the aspects of both market making and hedging.

The Bank held no derivative instruments as at nine months ended September 30, 2024 (December 31, 2023: Nil).

# 37. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified under held-to-collect model, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified under held-to-collect model are carried at amortised cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since assets and liabilities are either short term in nature or in the case of customer loans and deposits are frequently repriced.

---

## Chunk 121

# Fair value of financial assets

IFRS 13 requires the Bank to classify fair value measurement using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has following levels:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

---

## Chunk 122

# 37.1 Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level:

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Financial Instruments - Level 1| |
|Shares of listed companies|Fair values of investments in listed equity securities are valued on the basis of closing quoted market prices available at the Pakistan Stock Exchange / Bloomberg.|
|Financial instruments - Level 2| |
|Mutual fund units|Fair values of investments in mutual fund units are determined based on redemption prices disclosed at the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) as at the close of the business days.|
|Market Treasury Bills (MTB), Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIB) and GoP Sukuks|Fair values of Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills and GoP Sukuks are derived using PKRV, PKFRV and PKISRV rates.|
|Debt Securities (TFCs) and Sukuk other than Government|Investments in debt securities (comprising of Term Finance Certificates, Bonds and any other security issued by a company or a corporate body for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the SECP.|
|Overseas Government Sukuks, Overseas and Euro Bonds|The fair value of Overseas Government Sukuks, and Overseas & Euro Bonds are valued on the basis of price available on Bloomberg.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the foreign exchange revaluation rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
|Derivatives|The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currencies involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration, etc.|
|Financial instruments - Level 3|Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.|

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and, unavailability of reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

---

## Chunk 123

# Non-Financial assets - Level 3

Fixed assets - Land and building Fixed assets and Non-banking assets under satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values as disclosed in note 11 and 14 of these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements. The valuations are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of State Bank of Pakistan. The valuation experts used a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank’s properties. The market approach used prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.

37.3 The following table provides an analysis of financial assets that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.

## Chunk 152

# 4.1 Impact of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

During the period, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9: ‘Financial Instruments' became applicable to the Group.

BPRD Circular No. 03 dated July 05, 2022 issued by SBP provides detailed instructions on implementation of IFRS 9 (the Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks. The SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 have made amendments and extend the timelines of IFRS 9 application instructions.

The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘expected credit losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Group which are exposed to credit risk.

## Chunk 153

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

The Group has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions from January 01, 2024, using the modified
retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of
financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at
January 01, 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard. Accordingly, the information presented for
2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS
9.

SBP wide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 have made amendments and extended timelines of application
instructions. Under the new guidelines, the banks are allowed to use the existing practice for recognising markup income / expense
on financial assets / liabilities up to September 30, 2024. However, banks shall ensure the recognition of markup income / expense
on financial assets / liabilities on the effective interest rate method as per the IFRS 9 standard with effect from October 01, 2024.
Further, the banks will apply modification accounting for financial assets and liabilities as per IFRS 9 standard and shall measure
the subsidized staff financing, extended to their employees as per HR policies, at fair value as per the IFRS 9 standard with effect
from October 01, 2024. Moreover, SBP has allowed an extension to Banks up to December 31, 2024 for developing the requisite
models for calculating EAD for revolving products beyond the contractual date. In addition, the banks have also been allowed to
cost existing practice of valuing unquoted equity investments at their cost or breakup value, whichever is lower, till December 31,
2024 and perform fair valuation of these securities afterwards.

# 4.1.6 Impact on regulatory capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the banks, which has reduced their lending
capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined
that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from
the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the 'Application Instructions' issued by SBP has detailed the
transitional arrangement.

The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional
arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax
effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the transitional adjustment amount) must
be partially included (i.e., added back) to CET1 capital over the transition period of five years.

Moreover, SBP has allowed to adjust the amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions in Tier 2 Capital that have not been
added back to CET 1 and vice versa as per Annexure-A of BPRD Circular No. 16 dated July 29, 2024.

## Chunk 160

# 4.1.7 Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based
on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment
of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
regardless of the business model in which they are held.

---

## Chunk 161

# 4.1.7.1 Recognition and initial measurement

Trade receivable and debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and
financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially
measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or
issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at transaction price.

---

## Chunk 162

# 4.1.7.2 Classification

(a) Financial Assets
On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL.
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as
at FVTPL:
- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows;
and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.
A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at
FVTPL:
- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows
and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held-for-trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Bank changes its business models for managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following changes in the business model. IFRS 9 allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any 'accounting mismatch' that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising gains and losses on them on different basis. SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout life of the instrument. Nonetheless, banks should avoid this option for financial instruments that are categorised as Level 3 in terms of.

---

## Chunk 164

# (b) Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), when they are held-for-trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognised in profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method. Markup expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit and loss. Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in scope of the standard are never bifurcated. Instead, the whole hybrid instrument is assessed for classification.

---

## Chunk 165

# 4.1.8 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either held-to-collect, held-to-collect and sale and others based on Business Model Assessment. The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The assessment requires judgement based on facts and circumstances on the date of assessment. The information considered mainly includes:

- the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual markup revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Bank’s management;
- the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and its strategy for how those risks are managed;
- how managers of the business are compensated (e.g., whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected); and
- the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case' scenarios into account. Transfer of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Bank continuing recognition of the financial assets. Financial assets that are held-for-trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held-to-collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

# 4.1.9 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as interest margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Bank considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Bank considers:

- contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
- leverage features;
- prepayment and extension terms;
- terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and
- features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).

A prepayment feature is consistent with the SPPI criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and markup on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a discount or premium to its contractual par-amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.

The Bank holds a portfolio of long-term fixed-rate loan for which the Bank has the option to propose to revise the interest rate at periodic reset dates. These reset rights are limited to the market rate at the time of revision. The borrowers have an option to either accept the revised rate or redeem the financing at par without penalty. The Bank has determined that the contractual cash flows of these loan are SPPI because the option varies the interest rate in a way that is consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic financing risks and costs associated with the principal amount outstanding.

# 4.1.10 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

- Financial assets at FVTPL: These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any markup or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.
- Financial assets at amortised cost: These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Markup, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.
- Debt investments at FVOCI: These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and is assessed for impairment under the new ECL model. Markup income is calculated using the effective interest method and includes amortisation of premiums and accretion of discount, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in income statement. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit and loss account.
- Equity investments at FVOCI: These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are adjusted from the carrying value of investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit and loss account.

The banks are allowed to continue measuring unquoted equity securities at the lower of cost or break-up value up to December 31, 2024. However, Bank shall be required to measure unquoted equity securities at fair value, as required in the IFRS 9 application instructions, with effect from January 01, 2025.

# 4.1.11 Amortised cost and gross carrying amount

The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance (or impairment allowance before January 01, 2024).

The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

---

## Chunk 169

# 4.1.12 Calculation of markup income and expense

Markup income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:

- the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or
- the amortised cost of the financial liability.

The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability.

In calculating markup income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, markup income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of markup income reverts to the gross basis.

For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, markup income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of markup income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves.

---

## Chunk 170

# 4.1.12.1 Presentation

Markup / interest earned as presented in the profit and loss account includes markup income calculated using the effective interest method as presented in sub note which includes:

- markup on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost; and
- markup on debt instruments measured at FVOCI;

Markup / interest expense as presented in the profit and loss account includes markup expense calculated using the effective interest rate method as presented in sub note which includes:

- financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

Markup income and expense on all trading assets and liabilities are considered to be incidental to the Bank’s trading operations and are presented together with all other changes in the fair value of trading assets and liabilities in net trading income.

Markup income and expense on other financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are presented in net income from other financial instruments at FVTPL.

Under IFRS 9 markup income earned on non-performing financial assets is determined by using the credit adjusted effective interest rate. However, in accordance with the application instructions the unrealised markup earned on non-performing assets are kept in a memorandum account and are not credited to the profit and loss account. However, the Banks are advised to recognise income on non-performing assets (loans classified under PRs i.e., OAEM and Stage 3 loan) on a receipt basis in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations issued by SBP.

# 4.1.13 Derecognition

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between:

- the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognized); and
- the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI shall be recognised in profit or loss.

From January 01, 2024 any cumulative gain / loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated at FVOCI is not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any markup on transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Bank is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its statement of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or a portion of them. In such cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised. Examples of such transactions are securities lending and sale-and-repurchase transactions.

When assets are sold to a third party with a concurrent total rate of return swap on the transferred assets, the transaction is accounted for as a secured loan transaction similar to sale-and-repurchase transactions, because the Bank retains all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of such assets.

In transactions in which the Bank neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Bank continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.

In certain transactions, the Bank retains the obligation to service the transferred financial asset for a fee. The transferred asset is derecognised if it meets the derecognition criteria. An asset or liability is recognised for the servicing contract if the servicing fee is more than adequate (asset) or is less than adequate (liability) for performing the servicing.

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

---

## Chunk 172

# 4.1.14 Modification

(a) Financial Assets

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of loans to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification are accounted for as follows:

- fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and
- other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.

If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

---

## Chunk 173

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

Where derecognition of financial assets is appropriate, the newly recognised residual loans are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classified as purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI). If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the bank first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognise the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred, and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset. If such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as markup income calculated using the effective interest rate method.

---

## Chunk 174

# (b) Financial Liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability recognised and consideration paid is recognised in profit and loss account. Consideration paid includes non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability. If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. For floating-rate financial liabilities, the original effective interest rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument.

---

## Chunk 175

# 4.1.15 Reclassification

Financial liabilities are not reclassified subsequent to initial recognition. Reclassifications of financial assets are made when, and only when, the business model for those assets changes. Such changes are expected to be infrequent and arise as a result of significant external or internal changes such as the termination of a line of business or the purchase of a subsidiary whose business model is to realise the value of pre-existing held for trading financial assets through a hold to collect model. Financial assets are reclassified at their fair value on the date of reclassification and previously recognised gains and losses are not restated. Moreover, reclassifications of financial assets between financial assets held at amortised cost and financial assets held at FVOCI do not affect effective interest rate or expected credit loss computations.

---

## Chunk 176

# (a) Reclassified from amortised cost

Where financial assets held at amortised cost are reclassified to financial assets held at FVTPL, the difference between the fair value of the assets at the date of reclassification and the previously recognised amortised cost is recognised in the profit and loss account. For financial assets held at amortised cost that are reclassified to FVOCI, the difference between the fair value of the assets at the date of reclassification and the previously recognised gross carrying value is recognised in comprehensive income. Additionally, the related cumulative expected credit loss amounts relating to the reclassified financial assets are reclassified from provisions to a separate reserve in comprehensive income at the date of reclassification.

---

## Chunk 177

# (b) Reclassified from fair value through other comprehensive income

Where financial assets held at FVOCI are reclassified to financial assets held at FVTPL, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in comprehensive income is transferred to the profit and loss account. For financial assets held at FVOCI that are reclassified to financial assets held at amortised cost, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in comprehensive income is adjusted against the fair value of the financial asset such that the financial asset is recorded at a value as if it had always been held at amortised cost. In addition, the related cumulative expected credit losses held within comprehensive income are reversed against the gross carrying value of the reclassified assets at the date of reclassification.

(c) Reclassified from fair value through profit or loss

Where financial assets held at FVTPL are reclassified to financial assets held at FVOCI or financial assets held at amortised cost, the fair value at the date of reclassification is used to determine the effective interest rate on the financial asset going forward. In addition, the date of reclassification is used as the date of initial recognition for the calculation of expected credit losses. Where financial assets held at FVTPL are reclassified to financial assets held at amortised cost, the fair value at the date of reclassification becomes the gross carrying value of the financial asset.

---

## Chunk 179

# 4.1.16 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (ECL) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (12-month ECL). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL).

---

## Chunk 180

# (a) Measurement of ECL

ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:

- financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive);
- financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows;
- undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive; and
- financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Bank expects to recover.

---

## Chunk 181

# (b) Restructured financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows:

- If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset.
- If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.

Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in ‘Stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘Stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘Stage 3’.

---

## Chunk 182

# (c) Non-Performing financial assets

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit‑impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘non-performing’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

---

## Chunk 183

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- the restructuring of a loan by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.

Under the IFRS 9 Application instructions, the Bank is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency. The Bank is required to calculate ECL on its non-performing financial assets as higher of provision under Prudential Regulations (PR) and ECL under IFRS 9.

The Bank calculates the ECL against corporate, commercial and SME loan portfolios as higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at borrower/facility level, whereas against the retail borrowers the Bank will calculate ECL at higher of PR and ECL under IFRS 9 at segment/product basis as instructed under Annexure-A of BPRD Circular No. 16 dated July 29, 2024.

Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 and Application Instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

1. Probability of default (PD)
The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12 month ECL, Stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2). PD is estimated using internal rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk rating. The bank has used Transition Matrix approach for estimation of PD for each internal rating. The bank have used roll-rate method using the days past due (DPD) criteria to estimated PD for its retail portfolio. PD are then adjusted with forward looking information for calculation of ECL.
2. Exposure at default (EAD)
The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant. The Bank estimates EAD for financial assets carried at an amortised cost equal to principal plus profit. Each repayment date is assumed to be default point in the model and the ECL is calculated on EAD at each reporting date and discounted at the effective interest rate. Further, cash and cash equivalent collaterals the Bank holds against the non-retail facilities are adjusted from the EAD.
3. Loss given default (LGD)
An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

---

## Chunk 184

# 4.1.17 Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and/or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they meet the requirements of PR issued by SBP. Financial assets in Stage 2 may be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. However, a minimum period of 6 months from initial downgrade is required before any facility is moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to move back from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it should meet the criteria defined under the respective Prudential Regulations for de-classification of account/facility. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

---

## Chunk 185

# JS BANK LIMITED

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular No. 3 dated July 05, 2022. However, banks are free to choose more stringent days past due criteria.

The Bank measures ECL on a lifetime basis for POCI instruments throughout the life of the instrument. However, ECL is not recognised in a separate loss provision on initial recognition for POCI instruments as the lifetime expected credit loss is inherent within the gross carrying amount of the instruments. The Bank recognises the change in lifetime expected credit losses arising subsequent to initial recognition in the profit and loss account and the cumulative change as a loss provision. Where lifetime ECL on POCI instruments are less than those at initial recognition, then the favorable differences are recognised as impairment gains in the profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 186

# 4.1.18 Write-offs

Financial assets are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level.

Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in the profit and loss account and OCI.

Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Bank’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

---

## Chunk 187

# 4.1.19 Offsetting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

---

## Chunk 188

# 4.1.20 Undrawn loan commitments and guarantees:

‘Financial guarantees’ are contracts that require the Bank to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. ‘loan commitments’ are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions.

Financial guarantees issued or commitments to provide a loan at a below-market profit rate are initially measured at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at the higher of the loss allowance determined in accordance with IFRS 9 and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.

When estimating lifetime ECL for undrawn loan commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the loans are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

---

## Chunk 189

# 4.1.21 Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank has adopted a governance framework requiring the Risk, Finance, Operations, Internal Audit and IT functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. IFRS 9 requires robust credit risk models that can predict Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD).

The Bank’s Risk Management Division has developed models / methodologies for PD, LGD and Credit Conversion Factors (CCF). These models are validated on an annual basis considering the following aspects:

- Quantitative Validation: Expected credit loss (ECL) model design validation, data quality validation and benchmarking with external best practices.
- Quantitative Validation: Calibration testing which ensures the accuracy of the observed PDs.

# 4.2 Revised format of condensed interim financial statements

The SBP through its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 09, 2023, and BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 dated April 13, 2023, has amended the format of quarterly and half yearly financial statements of banks. All banks are directed to prepare their quarterly and half yearly financial statements on the revised format effective from accounting year starting from January 01, 2024. Accordingly, the Bank has prepared these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements on the new format prescribed by the SBP.

The adoption of revised format has resulted in following significant changes:

- Right-of-use-assets (Note 12) amounting to Rs. 6,915.113 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 5,848.280 million) which were previously shown as part of fixed assets are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.
- Lease liabilities (Note 18) amounting to Rs. 7,957.294 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 6,686.639 million) which were previously shown as part of other liabilities (note 21) are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.

# 37. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified under held-to-collect model, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified under held-to-collect model are carried at amortised cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since assets and liabilities are either short term in nature or in the case of customer loans and deposits are frequently repriced.

---

## Chunk 253

# Fair value hierarchy

IFRS 13 requires the Group to classify fair value measurement using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has following levels:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

---

## Chunk 254

# 37.1 Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level:

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Financial Instruments - Level 1| |
|Shares of listed companies|Fair values of investments in listed equity securities are valued on the basis of closing quoted market prices available at the Pakistan Stock Exchange / Bloomberg.|
|Financial instruments - Level 2| |
|Mutual fund units|Fair values of investments in mutual fund units are determined based on redemption prices disclosed at the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) as at the close of the business days.|
|Market Treasury Bills (MTB), Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIB) and GoP Sukuks|Fair values of Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills and GoP Sukuks are derived using PKRV, PKFRV and PKISRV rates.|
|Debt Securities (TFCs) and Sukuk other than Government|Investments in debt securities (comprising of Term Finance Certificates, Bonds and any other security issued by a company or a corporate body for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the SECP.|
|Overseas Government Sukuks, Overseas and Euro Bonds|The fair value of Overseas Government Sukuks, and Overseas & Euro Bonds are valued on the basis of price available on Bloomberg.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the foreign exchange revaluation rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
|Derivatives|The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currencies involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration, etc.|
|Financial instruments - Level 3|Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.|

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and, unavailability of reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

---

## Chunk 255

# Non-Financial assets - Level 3

Fixed assets - Land and building Fixed assets and Non-banking assets under satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values as disclosed in note 11 and 14 of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements. The valuations are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of State Bank of Pakistan. The valuation experts used a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank’s properties. The market approach used prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these consolidated financial statements.

37.3 The following table provides an analysis of financial assets that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
