# About the Report

# Adoption and Statement of Adherence with the International Integrated Reporting Framework

In the course of its operations, a commercial organization receives various inputs and converts them into value for itself and its stakeholders. This value creation can be over different time frames; short, medium and long term. An integrated report describes this value creation process concisely including the business model, strategies, governance, processes, risks and opportunities.

MCB, being one of the largest Commercial Banks in the country, plays a vital role in the economy through its presence at the grassroot level with a sprawling network of branches and a wide customer base. The Bank has a socio-economic impact that extends far beyond its bottom line; making it imperative for the Bank to reassure its stakeholders that all public interest stands adequately safeguarded.

Adoption of International Integrated Reporting (IR) Framework depends on the individual circumstances of an entity. The Bank has adopted the IR Framework to give an overview of Bank’s philosophy and to explain the connection between its financial and non-financial information; which would enhance user’s understanding as to how the Bank is continuously adopting to improve its performance keeping in view various stakeholder interests.

IR framework is still considered to be a practice in its early stages. We will continue to improve the information produced to make it even easier to understand while taking into account valuable opinions of stakeholders reading this report.

PRESIDENT’S
REVIEW

The year 2024 will be remembered as a period of transition and cautious optimism for the global economy. While geopolitical tensions and the lingering effects of past disruptions continued to pose challenges, the gradual shift towards monetary easing by major economies is providing much-needed relief to consumers and businesses. Lower borrowing costs helped ease financial pressures, creating a more favorable environment for growth and innovation. Against this backdrop, MCB Bank delivered another year of strong financial performance, reaffirming its position as one of Pakistan’s leading financial institutions.

Our international operations continued to grow, with MCB UAE expanding its footprint by opening a second branch in Sharjah, while MCB Bahrain delivered its highest-ever profit, reflecting our strategic focus on international market expansion and operational excellence. The Bank remained a key player in home remittances, recording USD 4.6 billion in inflows, recording a 41% increase and raising its market share to 13.2%. The State Bank of Pakistan ranked MCB as the 3rd largest bank in the home remittance market at the PRI Awards 2024, underscoring our efforts in strengthening formal remittance channels and supporting economic stability.

Throughout 2024, we remained steadfast in executing our strategic priorities—expanding our deposit base, strengthening core earnings, and enhancing our market presence. The Bank’s deposits grew by Rs. 117 billion, driven by a strategic focus on mobilizing low-cost and no-cost deposits. This growth was underpinned by well-defined key performance indicators (KPIs) and improved service quality. Additionally, our dedicated efforts in onboarding new-to-bank (NTB) customers, deepening existing relationships, and reactivating dormant accounts played a pivotal role in strengthening our deposit momentum.

MCB Bank’s financial strength, governance, and performance continued to be recognized across various platforms. PACRA reaffirmed our AAA (Triple A) long-term and A1+ (A One Plus) short-term credit ratings, showcasing our strong financial standing. Our Annual Report 2023 was ranked first in the banking sector and declared the overall winner by the Joint Evaluation Committee of ICAP and ICMA. At the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) 10th Annual Trade and Supply Chain Finance Program (TSCFP) Awards in Singapore, MCB Bank was honored with the accolades of ‘Leading Partner Bank in Pakistan’ and ‘Momentum Award – Issuing Bank’, recognizing our role in facilitating trade growth.

Our financial strength allowed us to deliver exceptional value to shareholders. The Bank declared 360% cash dividends reflecting our commitment to shareholder returns while maintaining a robust balance sheet. Profit Before Tax stood at Rs. 118.4 billion, while total assets increased by 11%, reaching Rs. 2.7 trillion. Average current deposits grew by Rs. 82 billion (+10%), fueled by a strategically focused deposit mobilization campaign. Despite aggressive monetary easing and a downward yield curve shift, net interest income grew by 1% to Rs. 149 billion.

Our fee & commission income recorded a 5% increase, while dividend income grew by 15% compared to the previous year. Maintaining cost discipline, the Bank’s cost-to-income ratio remained efficient at 32.68%, reflecting a disciplined expense management approach. The Return on Assets (ROA) of 2.25% and Return on Equity (ROE) of 26.56% further underscore our financial resilience and operational efficiency.

Our capital position remains strong and significantly above regulatory requirements, with a Capital Adequacy Ratio among the highest in the industry. The Bank’s risk management framework continues to evolve, ensuring improved asset quality and reduced delinquency across our loan book. MCB remains committed to nurturing a high-performing workforce by investing in employee development, fostering an inclusive culture, and enhancing workplace well-being. Our strategic talent initiatives ensure a skilled and engaged team, driving innovation and excellence across the organization.

As a responsible corporate citizen, MCB continues to create positive social impact through sustainable initiatives focused on financial inclusion, education, healthcare, and environmental conservation. Our commitment to ESG principles strengthens our role in building a more resilient and sustainable future.

MCB Bank is strategically positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities in an evolving economic landscape. As interest rates decline, competitive pressures rise and technology-driven banking accelerates, we remain fully committed to expand trade finance business, strengthening digital banking & payment solutions, enhancing customer-centric products & deposit growth and fostering an agile, risk-aware, and innovation-driven banking culture.

Our customer base expanded to more than 9.0 million accounts, supported by an extensive network of 1,403 branches and 1,477 ATMs across Pakistan, UAE, and Sri Lanka. Together with our wholly-owned Islamic banking subsidiary, we operate Pakistan’s second-largest branch network.

I extend my sincere gratitude to our Chairman and Board of Directors for their strategic leadership, the State Bank of Pakistan and other regulators for their guidance, our shareholders for their unwavering trust, our customers for their continued support, loyalty & business, and, most importantly, our employees, whose dedication and resilience continue to drive our success.

Together, we will continue to build a stronger, more innovative, and customer-focused MCB Bank.

# Forward Looking Statement

The Annual Report of MCB Bank Limited includes forward-looking statements across various sections. These statements are inherently subject to uncertainties regarding future events and should be interpreted accordingly by users of the report when making decisions. Forward-looking statements often include terms such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “will,” “may,” “would,” “presume,” “assure,” “hope,” and similar expressions.

# Pakistan’s Economic Outlook

Pakistan is on a positive economic recovery path, with FY2024 recording a GDP growth of 2.38% against previous years contraction of 0.21%. For the ongoing fiscal year (FY2025), SBP is projecting Pakistan’s GDP growth to remain range bound between 2.5% to 3.5%; with a stronger rebound expected in FY2026.

The growth projections for FY2025 remain modest amidst setbacks faced in the agriculture sector, primarily due to the low cultivation of important cash crops and challenges posed by water scarcity and rising temperatures to realization of optimum output yields. While the growth is expected to remain below country’s long-term average, the potential for progress hinges on the government’s ability to maintain a balanced, effective and sustainable economic policy.

Large-scale manufacturing (LSM) has experienced a YoY decline of 1.25% during the first five months of the fiscal year, primarily driven by low domestic demand and high cost of doing business. While the downturn occurs against the backdrop of a historically low base, however, there is cautious optimism on the horizon, as reduction in interest rates and currency stabilization are projected to facilitate a rebound in LSM; further reaffirmed by the positive trends emerging in food, textiles, and automobiles sectors.

# Fiscal Consolidation

On the external front, the country witnessed encouraging shifts in FY2024, driven by stabilization efforts that curbed the long-standing imbalances. Looking ahead to FY2025, the current account is expected to post a surplus; with US$ 1.2 billion already recorded during the first half. Government’s strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing export-oriented sectors and continued vigilance on managing imports of non-essential items shall support in keeping the trade balance in check.

Remittances remain a crucial pillar of Pakistan’s external account. Factors such as stability of PKR against the US dollar, an increase in the number of Pakistani workers moving abroad and narrowing spread between interbank and open market exchange rates are likely to further bolster the influx and contribute significantly to the external account.

Pakistan has successfully signed a crucial agreement with the IMF for a 37-month Extended Fund Facility valued at US$ 7 billion. Additionally, authorities have received firm commitments from essential bilateral partners to maintain their existing exposures throughout the program, which will help bridge country’s funding gap. The IMF program underscores the importance of maintaining a market-determined exchange rate as a fundamental strategy to rectify external imbalances and support the gradual buildup of reserves; hence, keeping the USD to PKR parity in check.

As the government navigates evolving dynamics, focusing on enhancing service exports and diversifying the overall export landscape will be essential for fostering economic resilience and maintaining a balanced trade outlook.

As the economy begins to recover, the path to sustained growth still remains engulfed in a multitude of challenges. Monetary easing, coupled with efforts to lower business costs, will create a more supportive environment for economic activity. Additionally, realization of initiatives to attract foreign investment and boost export potential, addressing the effects of climate-related risks, especially in the agricultural sector, fiscal consolidation and addressing long impeding structural issues are imperative to stimulating growth for improving economic prospects and social welfare.

# MCB’s Future Outlook

Enhancement of digital infrastructure

Increase in current deposit

Improve asset quality & recovery of NPL’s

Optimization of branch network

Development of human capital

Considering the existing disruptions, complexities and uncertainties, Pakistan’s banking sector will continue to face challenges in 2025. Furthermore, the rapidly evolving socio-economic and regulatory landscape is expected to further exacerbate the challenges surrounding its operating context.

Annual Report 2024

Remaining cognizant and following through on its ‘Strategic Plan’ centered around the key pillars of customer centricity, geographical expansion, technology & cyber security and people development (among others), the Bank is committed to deliver remarkable results to its investors; albeit in these challenging times.

To supplement its deposit mobilization drive, the Bank will focus on conversion of home remittances, soliciting quality NTB accounts, retention and deepening of existing deposit relationships and further on-boarding of cash management, collection and payroll processing mandates. Disciplined implementation of policies and procedures in ensuring a robust compliance and control culture, along with creation of operational efficiencies, shall continue to remain a key focus area for the Bank.

The Bank would continue to improve its asset quality. Credit being a mainstream business line of the Bank, instigates us to avail all righteous credit extension opportunities that fall within the defined risk appetite of the institution; while proactively monitoring watch listed portfolio of the Bank to minimize any further infection and ensure that recoveries are made in line with the agreements.

On the investments side, the Bank is committed to optimally manage excess liquidity through strategic re-profiling of the investment book in an evolving yield curve scenario.

Digital transformation is imperative to support enhanced customer experiences deducible from the adoption of advanced e-banking avenues. MCB’s transformation drive is focused on integrating digital technologies into all areas of banking operations; from internal systems to customer-facing interactions by augmentation of its technological infrastructure, process digitization, leveraging advanced analytics and most importantly, by changing the entire culture within the Bank towards more technology driven solutions.

The Bank is also investing in developing a workforce for the ‘Digital Banking Age’ by attracting and retaining the right skillset and competence; hence, aligning its human capital with the evolving business dynamics. To further drive customer centricity in its service delivery, the Bank will invest in empowering employees to lead a pleasant customer experience across all touch points. Also, through capacity and skills enhancement programs for the employees, we will continue emphasizing the need for the staff to serve customers as a means of consolidating its position as the preferred Bank in the industry. To sum up, employees’ development and trainings would remain at the forefront of our strategic focus and we would acutely remain conscious in attracting and retaining the best talent pool in the industry.

The Bank is committed in maintaining its unique positioning of a diversified financial institution with a robust heritage and strong reputation; through enriched service offerings and financially viable products tailored to meet requirements of its esteemed customers, hence, enabling it to serve both its existing and next-generation customers in the coming years while simultaneously translating the underlying financial strength of the entity into profits.

## Chunk 132

# Key Risks Going Forward

Intense competition within the industry for mobilizing deposits amidst low differentiation and switching costs; leading to an inability to capitalize on the expected increase in industry deposit base.

Risk of slower than expected deposit mobilization and advances growth; net interest margin not realized in line with the expected yield curve movements and growth projections.

Risk of lower than anticipated growth; as transactional volumes remain modest due to moderation in economic activity, on the back of subdued domestic demand, and imposition of additional taxes on financial/banking transactions as a fiscal consolidation measure.

Risk of cost-push pressures emanating from currency devaluation, geopolitical uncertainties impacting commodity prices and a resurgence in inflationary pressures; translating into higher than expected growth in expenditures. However, the Bank remains committed to managing expenditures through rationalization of discretionary spend and inculcation of operational efficiencies through business process automation and implementation of strong budgetary controls.

Higher Risk Weighted Assets (RWA’s).

Moderation in credit growth and increased risks to asset quality due to systemic or realization of idiosyncratic factors.

Regulatory revisions to impact dividend payout.

# Uncertainties that could affect Bank’s Resources, Revenues and Operations

All forward-looking statements are, by nature, subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond control. Major uncertainties that could affect Bank’s resources, revenues and operations are given below:

|Key Factor|Impact on Bank|Relevance|
|---|---|---|
|Discount rate / Monetary Policy Stance|Based on different assessment parameters, the SBP may change the discount rate in line with its monetary policy stance. Any further decrease in the discount rate will initially have a positive impact on Bank’s net interest income / NIM due to the repricing lag between earning assets and liabilities. However, as the rates stabilize, the net interest margins will narrow and have a negative impact on Bank’s profitability. The impact of interest rate sensitivity on the banks profitability has been disclosed in note 48.2.4 of the ‘Unconsolidated Financial Statements’.|Short to Long Term|

The Bank operated in Pakistan, UAE and Sri Lanka with its diverse network of 1,416 branches (including 13 sub-branches) and more than 1,450 ATMs.

Facilitation of overseas Pakistani’s under the RDA initiative and other national financial inclusion/support initiatives have remained a key focus area for the Bank.

The Bank continues to manage an efficient operating expense base and monitor costs prudently. Despite inflationary pressures and continued investments in human resources, branch network and technological upgradation, growth in operating expenses was contained at 18%; indicative of Banks circumspect approach to manage strategic tradeoff between short term tactical cost reductions and long-term cost initiatives.

The quantum of recoveries in 2024 stood at Rs. 3.486 billion; through settlement of a large number of hardcore and protracted defaults.

The total asset base of the Bank, on an unconsolidated basis, was reported at Rs. 2,703 billion (+11.38%). Return on Assets and Return on Equity was recorded at 2.25% and 26.56% respectively, whereas the book value per share increased to Rs. 191.73.

# Human Resource Accounting Policy

At MCB Bank we believe in pursuing a modern ‘Human Resource Accounting Policy (HRA)’ which encapsulates accounting of Bank’s management and employees as ‘human assets’ or ‘capital’ that provides future benefits, rather than them being considered as an expense which is what comprises a typical approach under traditional human resource accounting.

The Bank has progressed forward to ensure that the people aspect of its business focuses on improving the standards and proficiency of employee skills and retaining talent for succession planning and expansion into new domains; thus, generating greater contribution and improving returns through implementation of higher investment, efficiency and resource productivity initiatives. In fact, HRA has allowed the Bank to keep track of investments it is making in its human resources, and the specific returns it is generating from these investments, thus fostering a virtuous cycle of growth and returns.

The Bank leverages its HRA strategically to drive positive change in its human resources, which comprises the most vital assets of the bank. Over time, through insights from its HRA, the Bank has been able to strategically reposition its human resources to face the rapid changes in the banking and financial services sector, especially now when digital banking is gaining fast credence. At the Bank, we have not only ensured that the skills and capabilities of our human resources are aligned to the times, but have also made sure that the Bank always remains in a position of deep strength through its people resources, notwithstanding the challenges prevalent in the external environment.

# Net Interest Income

# Quarter 1

During the 1st quarter of 2024, Net Interest Income (NII) of the Bank increased by 27% and was reported at Rs. 38.071 billion. The markup income was concentrated by markup from investments which amounted to Rs. 59.844 billion and constituted 67% of the gross amount while the markup income from advances was reported at Rs. 26.335 billion. The increase in gross markup income was broad based; driven by improving earning margins, in an upward sloping yield curve, and volumetric growth achieved in earning assets.

On the markup expense side, Rs. 45.049 billion was reported on account of markup expense on deposits; representing an increase of 81% over the corresponding period owing primarily to higher minimum saving rate applicable during the quarter in review.

---

## Chunk 179

# Quarter 2

NII during the 2nd quarter of 2024 was reported at Rs. 36.786 billion; exhibiting a modest decline of merely 0.4% when compared to the corresponding period. An analysis of the markup income mix highlights that the concentration of markup income on investments and gross advances was reported at 68% and 29% respectively; against 61% and 35% reported in the corresponding period.

---

## Chunk 180

# Quarter 3

NII during the 3rd quarter was reported at Rs. 40.215 billion; 2% higher compared to the corresponding period of 2023.

Gross mark up income earned increased by 9%. primarily on account of rising average volumes (up by Rs. 253 billion on a QoQ basis). On the markup expenses side, deposit cost grew by 16%, primarily on account of higher mobilization and a slight dilution of current account concentration in the deposits mix.

# Quarter 4

Amidst an evolving yield curve scenario and easing of the monetary policy stance, with 450bps reduction in policy rate announced during the quarter, NII registered a decline of 18%; recording at Rs. 34.022 billion as compared to Rs. 41.284 billion recorded in the corresponding quarter.

|---|---|---|
|Non Markup Income|9.124|9.132|
|Non Markup Expenses|5.922|6.199|
|Profit|32.473|30.749|

# Vertical Analyses

Vertical analyses depicts higher concentration levels of investments and advances in the asset base of the Bank. The advances base of the Bank had grown steadily over the period. However, the decline in advances witnessed during 2020 due to lack of credit extension opportunities within the Bank’s defined risk appetite and the consequent diversion of excess liquidity towards the investment book has diluted advances concentration in the total asset mix; hence falling to 26% in 2020 from 33% in 2019. In 2021, the V shaped recovery witnessed in key economic sectors laid the foundation for a broad based growth in Bank’s advances; improving concentration of advances in the asset base to 30%. The upward trajectory gained further traction in 2022 and despite a challenging economic environment, the Bank achieved a historic growth of Rs. 162 billion in advances; increasing its concentration in the total asset base to 36%. The growth momentum subsided in 2023, as the high interest rates coupled with slowdown in economic activity impacted private sector credit growth; hence, concentration of advances in the total asset base falling to 24% in 2023 as excess liquidity was diverted towards investments. However, during the current year, a reassurance in economic activity coupled with monetary easing has resulted in an unprecedented growth in advances; translating into an all-time high advances concentration of 39% in the total asset mix in 2024.

During 2020, the Banking industry steered through challenging economic conditions prevalent due to ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Timely and well calibrated policy measures rolled out by the SBP facilitated the banking industry to improve profitability, enhance resilience and restrict the credit risk to an acceptable level. However, the accumulation of Deposits was majorly diverted towards investments which resulted in a spike in investments to Deposit (IDR) ratios of the banking industry; MCB’s IDR increased from 65% in 2019 to 78% in 2020. In 2024, markup income recorded a growth of 12%.

Markup income growth has registered a steady rise over the last 6 years, barring the exception of year 2021 wherein the earning margins had been adversely impacted by a reversion in yield curve and diluted the impact of volumetric growth achieved in the Bank’s asset base. In the year 2023, markup income registered a significant growth of 63% primarily on account of improving earning margins amidst a 750 bps higher average applicable policy rate during the year.

# Markup Expense and Income Concentration

Markup expense has increased over the last 6 years based on regulatory revisions enacted over the period and volumetric growth registered in the deposit base. Concentration of non markup income in the total income has decreased from 11% in 2019 to 9% in 2024. This dilution has primarily been on account of rising gross markup income; whose concentration levels have increased from 89% in 2019 to 91% in 2024. Non markup expense concentration level has declined from 30% in 2019 to 23% in 2024 despite expansion in business; which is due to various cost control initiatives.

# Commentary on Cash Flow Statement:

Operating cash flows depict net cashflows generated from core activities of the bank i.e. deposit mobilization and loans and advances disbursements. In 2024, total cash outflows used in operating activities were Rs. 88.209 billion as compared to cash inflows of Rs. 378.129 billion recorded in 2023. Major reason for this trend change is due to the net disbursements of Rs. 489.922 billion recorded in the credit book during the year.

The investing activities posted a net cash inflow due to the contraction of investment book and diversion of excess liquidity towards loans and advances, as improving macroeconomic indicators and resurgence in economic activity generated demand for credit; within Bank’s defined risk appetite. The net cash inflows from investments in 2024 stood at Rs. 131.607 billion.

Cash outflow from financing activities primarily reflect payments on account of dividends to the shareholders. The increase in financing cash outflows is due to the higher dividend payout in 2024; a cumulative dividend of Rs. 36 per share was paid in 2024 as compared to Rs. 27 per share of dividend paid in 2023. MCB’s track record of paying one of the highest dividends per share in the financial sector has meant that the Bank has paid over Rs. 100 billion in interim and final dividend payouts over the last 5 years.

# Key Trends and Expectations

MCB undertakes a comprehensive analysis of its internal and external environment to identify emerging trends that are reshaping the financial solutions and service offering’s landscape:

|Potential Niche Market|Digital Transformation|Sustainable and Ethical Banking (ESG)|Expanding Markets for Financial Services|
|---|---|---|---|
|Women in Pakistan remain disproportionately under-served by the country’s financial system. This disparity is rooted in a complex interplay of socioeconomic and cultural factors: - Digital Financial Inclusion of Pakistan is recorded at 17.7% vis-a-vis south Asia’s average of 29%; for Pakistan women the metric is in single digits i.e. 5% compared to the regional average of 20.5%
- An estimated 47 million women are not in the labor force, and there are 55 million unbanked women.
- Of more than 5 million small and medium enterprises in the country only 8% are owned by women.
|Customers expect intuitive, user-friendly interfaces and personalized digital journeys. - Total transaction value in the Digital Payments market of Pakistan is projected to reach US$ 89.03 billion by 2029.
- Reach of banking services in Pakistan encompasses 60% of the adult population.
- Digitization has the potential to add USD 60 billion to Pakistan’s Economy by 2030; with around one-third (USD 10 - USD 20 billion) flowing into ESG through advancements in artificial intelligence (AI).
- 5G spectrum auction and service rollout expected by April 2025.
|ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) considerations are becoming increasingly important in the global banking sector, and Pakistan is also seeing a growing emphasis on these principles; driven by regulatory emphasis and stakeholder expectations for sustainable loans, and other financial products that support environmentally friendly projects. - UN SDGs Index 2024 has ranked Pakistan 137th out of 166 countries.
- The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has announced a staged adoption approach for the ISSB standard; IFRS S1 and IFRS S2.
|The role of bank branches in Pakistan's banking industry is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the rapid adoption of digital technologies, and changing customer behaviors and preferences for customized interactions: - Pakistan’s population is expected to surpass 400 million by 2050.
- 40.7% of the Pakistan’s population is expected to become urban by 2030.
While digital banking is on the rise, physical branches still hold a vital, though evolving, place. The branch networks will continue to play a vital role in providing personalized advice, building relationships, and serving customers who prefer face-to-face interactions while simultaneously inculcating evolving technologies that further enhance the branch experience and create a seamless omnichannel banking environment.|

Addressing this financial inclusion gap for women in Pakistan requires a multi-faceted approach from banks that considers both social and economic factors. Empowering women economically through financial inclusion is crucial for achieving gender equality and promoting sustainable development.

## Chunk 258

# Implications

The large amounts of capital required to setup a Bank along with the length of time consumed to establish a significant brand loyalty and the need to adhere to strict regulatory stipulations serve as strong entry barrier for new entrants.

However, the domestic landscape has been evolving to include Fintech participants that are focusing on transactional services and innovative digital solutions for revolutionizing the customer banking experience.

- Improving customer-brand relationship that goes beyond the minimum transactional services to retain customer loyalty;
- Investing substantially in digital platforms for improving customer convenience;
- Launching new products and services that cater to a diversified customer base;
- Closely monitoring and adapting to evolving regulations to ensure highest levels of compliance;
- Partnering with fintech companies to leverage their technology and expertise, and integrating fintech solutions into bank’s offerings.

## Chunk 260

# Implications

It is reasonably easy for retail customers to switch to other banks fully, or even avail part of their service requirements alternatively due to the low switching costs involved, hence shrinking the size of banking engagement. However, their bargaining power stays limited due to the minimal impact on the Bank’s bottom line.

The bargaining power of larger groups, corporate clients and high net worth individuals is effectively increase switching costs for customers.

## Chunk 261

# Corresponding Strategies

MCB addresses the issue of customer bargaining power primarily by focusing on clearly directed customer retention and acquisition strategies; customer service standards are being continuously augmented, services are being tailored to suit individual needs, innovative solutions are being devised to make customer experiences more enjoyable, convenient and hassle-free and market competitive rates are being offered.

---

## Chunk 262

# Implications

MCB’s suppliers primarily comprise of its deposit-holders who are the Bank’s key resource for capital and its employees, also known as the resource of labor. In an industry scenario with low differentiation, it is easy for the primary deposit-holder group to switch to other banks, tempted by higher rates and better service standards. Further, share of deposits is highly concentrated, which gives them excess bargaining power.

---

## Chunk 263

# Corresponding Strategies

- MCB has embraced following strategies in order to derive an edge over its supplier relationships:
- Providing a high degree of safety to its capital providers including investors, deposit-holders and other banking partners; A point further re-enforced by Bank’s highest local credit ratings of AAA/A1+ for long term and short term debt respectively;
- Diversify the supplier base to reduce dependence on any single supplier.
- Building strong relationships with key suppliers to negotiate better terms and ensure a stable supply of critical inputs.
- Creating mutually-beneficial solutions across the entire engagement spectrum;
- Sustaining employee retention focus by offering a challenging, learning and conductive work environment which is duly complemented by career progression opportunities and market competitive salary and benefit packages.

- Intensity of Competitive Rivalry
- Number and Size of Competitors
- Industry Growth
- Product Differentiation
- Diversity of Competitors

## Chunk 264

# Implications

Intensity of competition within the domestic banking sector has grown over the years. Banks have focused on developing a wide range of asset and liability product offerings at competitive rates in order to reinforce their customer acquisition strategies and attract existing market share. The relatively low switching cost from one bank to another has further intensified the importance of competition within the industry, especially in the retail and commercial banking spheres.

Traditional banking operating models are being disrupted by the rapidly evolving digital technologies; challenging the existing banking landscape and paving way for the industry to adopt emerging technologies in rendering digital financial services at customers convenience.

# Macro Economic & Thematic Reviews

# PESTEL Analysis

# Political Scenario

Throughout its history, Pakistan’s political landscape has remained volatile and unstable; with these instabilities partially contributing to the stifled and irregular economic growth patterns witnessed in the country. Uncertainties associated with an unstable political environment impede the long term visibility of monetary and fiscal authorities and hence, lead them to implement non-optimal macroeconomic policies that have a narrow horizon.

The country’s banking system is inherently impacted by policymaking and political trends that effect macro shifts to business models. While the banking industry in Pakistan has, over the years, ridden waves of political uncertainty with relative calm and steadiness, they no doubt remain inextricably intertwined with the environment within which they operate. Remaining cognizant, MCB continuously re-aligns its strategies in-sync with the evolving scenario, however, the overall performance of the banking sector still remains heavily linked to the outcome of consensus among political stakeholders and their will for implementing long neglected structural reforms that are imperative to support sustainable macroeconomic stability and ensure an inclusive and sustainable national development agenda.

# Economic Overview

During FY2024, Pakistan’s economy registered moderate recovery reflected by a GDP growth of 2.38% against previous year’s contraction of 0.21%. The prudent policy management and the resumption of inflows from multilateral and bilateral partners, and the gradual economic recovery in the major trading partners, turned the negative growth in preceding year to positive growth in FY2024.

Notable contributors to economic recovery included robust agriculture growth (highest in 19 years on the back of double-digit rise in output of major crops), a decrease in inflationary pressures and an improved current account balance. Although inflationary pressures were significant at the start of the FY2024, with average inflation during July to February standing at 28%, the CPI reduced drastically to 12.57% YoY by June 2024. The decline in inflation was broad-based, reflecting the combined impact of monetary tightening, fiscal consolidation, smooth supplies of food items, favorable global commodity prices, and a high base effect.

On the external front, the government successfully trimmed down the trade deficit, supported by higher exports and restricted imports, leading to a sizeable decrease in the current account deficit. Cumulatively, the current account deficit in FY2024 narrowed significantly to 0.2% of GDP from 1% in the preceding year. Remittances grew by 10.7% and were recorded at US$ 30.251 billion, owing to structural reforms related to exchange companies and facilitation under PRI.

Consequently, the improved current account position, along with the revival of financial inflows, helped build SBP’s FX reserves; which reached US$ 9.39 billion by June 2024.

Annual Report 2024

In the first half of FY2025, driven by moderate domestic demand conditions and supportive supply-side dynamics, inflation continued to trend downwards in line with expectations, reaching 4.07% YoY in December 2024. On the fiscal front, taxation revenues remained below their target in H1-FY2025, with a cumulative aggregation of Rs. 5.623 trillion against the assigned target of Rs. 6.009 trillion, exerting further pressure on the primary balance, however, the lowered anticipated interest payments on the financing side are likely to contain the overall fiscal deficit around its assigned target.

# Social Factors

Pakistan’s social landscape is shaped by a complex interplay of demographic, socioeconomic, cultural, and religious factors. Since its independence, Pakistan has exhibited respectable economic growth with a phenomenal increase in the quantum of inherited infrastructure, however, it continues to lag behind in the sphere of human and social capital development. Formidable challenges on the socio-economic front have been further exacerbated by a combination of low growth and high inflation, which is one of the major factors leading to perpetuation of poverty and unemployment.

Over the course of history, many nations have faced similar challenges and have successfully turned them into opportunities through sound economic planning, good governance and consistency in policy implementation. In Pakistan’s context, the relatively young work force, rapid urbanization, improving literacy rate, and a socially well connected human capital are some of the augmenting forces that have the potential to uplift the national economy.

At MCB, our aim is to remain socially conscious by managing our business activities with integrity and holding ourselves accountable to all stakeholders on issues pertaining to sustainability, environmental performance and other ethical concerns.

# Technological Innovation & Digitization

The ongoing global technology revolution and widespread adoption of digital technologies have transformed the way people interact with financial services, including how they access banking services, make payments, invest, and manage their money. In many ways it has accelerated the adoption of digital products, services and channels; leading to new revenue channels, increased productivity, and cost savings. At the same time, technology continues to impact organizational structures and business models, skill requirements, internal processes and capabilities, as well as remote work practices.

Over the past few years financial services companies have increasingly started to embrace and leverage mobile technology, fintech partnerships, cloud computing, big data, advanced analytics, machine learning, blockchain technology, AI, robotics and biometrics in the optimization of legacy IT infrastructure for pursuing new revenue channels and opportunities.

With a growing youth population and a tech-savvy workforce, Pakistan is at a critical juncture to harness the power of digital transformation to shape its future. The rise of mobile banking and digital payment solutions revolutionized the financial landscape, making transactions more efficient and accessible. As Pakistan navigates the complexities of the digital age, it must not only seize the opportunities but also proactively address the challenges to ensure an inclusive, sustainable, and digitally empowered future. Achieving this shall require undertaking a holistic approach that encompasses investment in education, cyber-security measures, and the development of a robust digital infrastructure.

However, along with the benefits, the adoption of digital solutions has also introduced new risks, especially in terms of cyber risks. The rise of cyberattacks, aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money, or disrupting normal business processes, has underscored the need for financial institutions to enhance their cybersecurity measures. Banks have become attractive targets for cyberattacks because of their key role in payment and settlement systems, the volume of sensitive client information they hold and the potentially adverse impact of interfering with the smooth functioning of banking services. Remaining cognizant, MCB continues to invest in cutting-edge technologies and capabilities that prioritize the security of its clients’ data and systems without adding needless friction to the client experience.

# Environmental Factors

Climate change and environmental-related natural disasters are associated with massive human losses, physical damages, and economic and fiscal losses, all affecting countries’ ability to meet their development goals. There is also a growing global recognition, amongst policy makers and investors, that such disasters pose risks to financial system stability that would seriously affect the solvency and profitability of the financial institutions.

The financial system is impacted by climate change through two main channels. The first involves physical risks, arising from damage to property, infrastructure, and land that could manifest into increased default risk of loan portfolios and lower values of assets. The second is the transition risk, resulting from changes in climate policy, technology, and consumer and market sentiment during the adjustment to a lower-carbon economy. Climate change can impact monetary policy direction, too, as slowing productivity growth and heightening uncertainty and inflation volatility can justify adaptation of a stance suited to evolving challenges, within the limits of central bank mandates.

Pakistan produces less than 1% of the world’s carbon footprint yet is suffering the biggest consequences of climate change. Changing seasonal weather patterns, rising temperatures, variability of monsoons and melting of glaciers in the north are just some of the effects of climate change that the country has been forced to contend with in the recent years. Hence, it remains imperative, for the country, to follow through on its National Adoption Plan (NAP) by investing in climate resilient infrastructure and ensuring inter-institutional coordination.

Pakistan is ranked as the 5th most vulnerable country to climate change according to the Global Climate Risk Index.

Pakistan faces some of the highest disaster risk levels in the world, ranked 20 out of 191 countries in the Inform Risk Index (2025).

In 2022, SBP issued ‘Environmental & Social Risk Management (ESRM) Implementation Manual’ for financial institutions requiring adoption within 3 years.

# Legal & Regulatory Landscape to Address New Frontiers of Risk

The characteristics and operations of the banking sector are governed by a comprehensive legal, regulatory and supervisory framework implemented by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).

To ensure effectiveness of the captioned framework, the SBP has also put in place an elaborate structure of surveillance and supervision that encompasses on-site assessments, thematic reviews on high-risk areas and periodic assessment of institutions based on CAELS (Capital, Asset Quality, Earnings, Liquidity and Sensitivity to other risks). Furthermore, the supervisory framework is being continuously updated to respond to the emerging developments in the sector and to conform to international standards.

Key themes including the need to manage disruptive impacts caused by the ongoing banking transformation based on technological & digital advancements, promoting diversity in access, modifying financial inclusion frameworks to cater to the emerging needs of an inclusive financial ecosystem with increased focus on sustainable and green financing, further strengthening of “Consumer protection” and “Fair Treatment of Consumer (FTC)” frameworks, promotion of SME and Islamic modes of financing and encouraging wider adoption of digital financial services are likely to influence the banking regulatory perspectives in 2025.

# Strategies in Place

From customer service standpoint, special focus remains on improving our service quality and service standards levels. The Bank will integrate service standards across all the channels and outlets in the network to provide a uniform customer experience.

MCB endeavors to meet expectations of its valued customer base. Another important aspect remains credit quality and Bank’s refined risk appetite. We will thereby give value to our customers across the entire spectrum of retail, corporate and SME segments while improving Bank’s asset quality.

Under the ‘Strategic Plan’, we also intend to expand our geographical boundaries by being open to potential new business models, innovative processes and delivery channels, enabling provision of 24x7 customer services.

Today, technology is a major component of the competitive edge of any bank. With millennials being an increasing percentage of our customer base, we have to cater to their expectations and it requires leveraging cutting edge technology. The other side of the coin however, is that technology brings risks with it. We will go the extra mile, to ensure our assets and those of our customers are secure and sensitive information is protected.

To ensure efficient and effective operations of the Bank, we need systems and processes that operate seamlessly. This is another focus area where we will concentrate on identifying pain points and gaps, and make the necessary modifications.

To safeguard the financial stability and reputation of the Bank, good governance and ethical conduct are imperative. While we already have high standards in these areas, we have set our benchmarks as the best in class practices in the country. We will renew and re-energize our focus on sustainability by ensuring that we continue to maintain a judicious balance between economic, social and environmental objectives.

The end result of all the above will be the enhancement of our ‘Brand’. The brand is a mirror of our image in the eyes of our customers, both legacy and millennials, and the general public. Through the strategies spelt out in our ‘Strategic Plan’ we will continue to forge ahead, building our Brand, increasing our assets and profitability, while delivering increasing value to all our stakeholders.

# Risk Management Framework

Risk is an inherent part of banking business activities. The risk management framework and governance structure at MCB helps to mitigate and counter any foreseeable risk in its various lines of business. Risk awareness forms an integral part of strategic and operational activities of risk management. Through its Global Risk Management Policy, the Bank sets the best course of action under uncertainty by identifying, prioritizing, mitigating and monitoring risk issues, with the goal of enhancing shareholders’ value. Bank’s risk management structure is based on the following five guiding principles:

- Optimizing risk / return in a controlled manner
- Establishing clear responsibility and accountability
- Establishing & maintaining independent and properly resourced risk management function.
- Promoting an open risk culture
- Adopting international best practices in risk management

The Bank executes its risk strategy and undertakes controlled risk-taking activities within its risk management framework. The Board of Directors (BOD) at MCB Bank Limited actively drive the risk management framework. Under the valuable guidance of BOD, the Bank has a proactive approach in dealing with factors that influence its financial standing, to generate recurrent earnings and to maximize shareholder’s value by achieving an appropriate trade-off between risk and returns. An effective risk management framework along-with a robust risk governance structure, strong capital & liquidity coupled with a good quality of credit portfolio remains a cornerstone of the Bank’s risk management goals.

Empowerment and independence are the basic principles in risk management and it is implemented as a fundamental part of BOD’s vision. Independence of areas that are responsible for measuring, analyzing, controlling and monitoring risk from the frontline risk takers (i.e. business soliciting groups) is ensured within the Bank.

Risk takers and Risk controllers have independent reporting lines, yet work together to increase Bank’s value via efficient utilization of capital. Through a four eye principle for credit approval levels for corporate and retail banking, all exposure related requests are approved with the formal consent of at least two authorized individuals including one from the business side having credit approval authority and the other from risk management side having credit review authority.

The BOD and its Risk Management & Portfolio Review Committee (RM&PRC) have ensured formulation and implementation of a comprehensive risk management framework. Under the BOD’s guidance, the Bank executed an effective risk strategy and continued to undertake controlled risk-taking activities within the risk management framework; combining core policies, procedures and process design with active portfolio management. The risk management framework requires strong integrated risk management practices in key strategic, capital and financial planning processes and day-to-day business processes across the organization, with a goal to ensure that risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner.

As a matter of principle, the Bank constantly endeavors to improve its risk management framework in the light of the international best practices and regulatory guidelines. Accordingly, all policies and procedural documents that form part of the Bank’s risk management framework are regularly reviewed to keep them aligned with changing market dynamics, regulatory environment and international standards. Keeping in view the international best practices and SBP requirements, BOD of the Bank has approved a Risk Appetite Statement, which takes into account quantitative and qualitative risk indicators, covering target ratios, credit, market, operational, liquidity and business risks.

The RM & PRC guides the management on its risk taking activities within the policy framework approved by the BOD. Regular meetings of RM&PRC are convened to oversee the risk exposures and their trends as a result of the various initiatives undertaken by the Bank. The committee reviews different aspects of the loan portfolio which, among others, includes asset growth, credit quality, credit concentration, lending business trend and cross sectional analysis. Review of various aspects of country risk, liquidity risk, market risk covering interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, equity price risk, technology risk along with the stress-testing is also a regular feature. Operational risk assessments, key risk indicators and major findings of Risk & Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) pertaining to processes, people, systems, technology and reputation are also regularly reviewed by the committee. The committee also reviews in detail the Bank’s capital levels under Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Capital Adequacy Ratio.

The Management Credit & Risk Committee is the management platform for discussion and deliberation on key risk issues in the portfolio. Regular meetings of the committee are convened to oversee the risk exposures in the portfolio of the Bank.

Risk Review successfully managed to evaluate and approve increased number of loan requests, within required turnaround time, both for domestic and international operations.

In line with SBP directives on implementation of IFRS-9, Bank’s internal guidelines for management of ‘Deteriorating Credits’ have been revamped. An in-house request tracking & turnaround time monitoring software ensures tracking of proposals and monitoring of turnaround-time of credit proposals routed through the Risk Management Group.

# Sovereign / Government Risk

For risk categorized as sovereign / government risk, the lending exposure is spread over multiple government owned or controlled organizations and departments which are engaged in a variety of tasks that ranges from different development related works to utility distribution and production. To manage adverse outcomes in terms of unfavorable scenarios, multiple control factors in the lending structure of the Bank provide additional comfort and support.

# Sensitivity Analysis due to Foreign Currency Fluctuation

The PKR appreciated by around 1.17% against the US Dollar in 2024. Foreign exchange risk exposes the bank to changes in the value of exposure denominated in foreign currencies due to the exchange rate fluctuation and volatility. The types of the instruments exposed to this risk are mainly investments in foreign branches, advances and deposits denominated in foreign currency, cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions etc. The core objective of the foreign exchange risk management is to ensure that the foreign exchange exposure of the Bank remains within defined risk appetite and insulates the Bank against undue losses that may arise due to volatile movements in foreign exchange rates or interest rates.

Limit structure to manage foreign exchange risk including gap limits in different tenors in major currencies are in place to control captioned risk. Bank’s net open position and Foreign Exchange Exposure Limits (FEEL) are monitored and reported on intra-day and day end basis. Foreign exchange risk parameters including VaR are generated and monitored on a daily basis. Stress testing of foreign exchange portfolio and its reporting to senior management and RM&PRC of the BOD is also a regular feature.

Credit Risk Review ensures to minimize credit risk associated at account and portfolio level. During the year, the Bank continued with the policy to remain selective in disbursing its loan to low risk customers across all the industries & maintains a fairly diversified loan portfolio. Risk Review successfully managed to evaluate and approve increased number of loan requests, within required turnaround time, both for domestic and international operations. Bank’s implemented Loan Origination System (LOS) for end to end automation of credit approval process facilitates effective management of Bank’s internal policies & controls as well as regulatory requirements. LOS has also contributed towards Bank’s transition to paperless environment under the Green Banking initiative.

For risk categorized as sovereign/ government risk, the lending exposure is spread over multiple government owned or controlled organizations and departments which are engaged in a variety of tasks that range from different development related works to utility distribution and production. To manage adverse outcomes in terms of unfavorable scenarios, multiple control factors in the lending structure of the Bank provide additional comfort and support. Such controls range from quality of eligible collateral, pre-disbursement safety measures to post disbursement monitoring.

Through a four eye principle for credit approval levels for corporate and retail banking, all such exposure related requests are approved with the formal consent of at least two authorized individuals including one from business side having credit approval authority and other from risk management side having credit review authority.

The MC&RC is the management platform for discussion and deliberation on key risk issues in the portfolio. Regular meetings of the committee are convened to oversee the risk exposures in the portfolio of the Bank.

In order to further enhance the credit risk analysis, the Bank has in place a probability of default based Internal Credit Risk Rating (ICRR) system which is based on statistical modeling and validation in line with Basel principles. The ICRR is currently focused on corporate-commercial customer category. Furthermore; Scoring Models are also in place to calculate ICRR for Small Enterprise, Medium Enterprise, Agriculture Finance and Overseas exposures. An Internal Credit Risk Rating Model for facility risk rating has also been implemented which reflects expected loss rate of a credit facility.

# Performance Review

2024 marked another year of strong financial performance for the Bank. The profit before taxation (PBT) and profit after taxation (PAT), for the year ended December 31, 2024, were reported at Rs. 118.4 billion and Rs. 57.6 billion respectively; translating into earnings per share (EPS) of Rs. 48.62. The Bank’s resilient performance is attributed to its stable core earnings base, diversified revenue streams, cost optimization initiatives and a strong risk management framework.

Despite a negative spread on saving deposits in the latter half of the year, net interest income recorded a modest 1% year-on-year growth. Non-markup income registered a strong increase of 14%, reaching Rs. 37.4 billion. This growth was primarily driven by a 5% rise in fee and commission income to Rs. 21.2 billion, an 8% increase in foreign exchange income to Rs. 9.2 billion, a 15% surge in dividend income to Rs. 3.5 billion, and gains on securities amounting to Rs. 3.1 billion.

In line with its strategy to diversify revenue streams, MCB saw strong growth in fee-based income across multiple channels, including a 32% increase in card-related income, 18% growth in branch banking fees and a 61% rise in investment service commissions. The Bank continues to invest in digital transformation, enhancing customer experiences and improving operational efficiency; fostering broad-based growth across digital platforms.

Operating expenses increased by 18%, primarily due to key expenditure outlays relating to staff costs, marketing, utilities, and IT related upgrades. However, the cost-to-income ratio of the Bank remained efficient at 32.68%, reflecting a disciplined financial management approach amidst continued investment in innovation and talent development.

With a strong focus on asset quality, the Bank’s robust credit risk management kept non-performing loans (NPLs) at Rs. 53.5 billion as of December 31, 2024, with coverage and infection ratios improving to 99.34% and 4.89% respectively.

On the financial position side, total assets’ base of the Bank was reported at Rs. 2.7 trillion; representing an increase of 11% over year end i.e. December 31, 2023. Return on Assets and Return on Equity was reported at 2.25% and 26.56% respectively, whereas the book value per share was reported at Rs. 191.73.

A rigorous deposit mobilization drive, focused on building no cost deposits, translated into growth of Rs. 116.8 billion in Bank’s total deposit base. Current deposits increased to the tune of Rs. 944 billion (+8.4%) while the CASA ratio improved to 97.24% compared to 96.81% reported at year end.

During 2024, MCB attracted home remittance inflows of USD 4,592 million (+41%), improving market share to 13.2%, to further consolidate its position as an active participant in SBP’s cause for improving flow of remittances into the country through banking channels.

While complying with the regulatory capital requirements, the Bank’s total Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) stands at 19.35% against the requirement of 11.5% (including capital conservation buffer of 1.50% as reduced under the BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020). Quality of capital is evident from Bank’s Common Equity Tier-1 (CET1) to total risk weighted assets ratio which comes to 15.49% against the requirement of 6.0%. Bank’s capitalization also resulted in a Leverage Ratio of 6.37% which is well above the regulatory limit of 3.0%. The Bank reported Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 241.33% and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of 128.29% against requirements of 100%.

# Impact of Government Policies on the Bank’s Performance

Amidst the various challenges faced by the Bank, encompassing a tough operating environment, lower economic activity and rising cost of doing business, MCB has stayed committed in supporting government’s economic policies aimed at fostering economic development and better utilization of resources.

Key measures taken to support policy initiatives stemming from the national agenda of financial inclusion, banking on equality, digitalization of financial services, promotion of sustainable finance and facilitation of overseas Pakistanis included:

- Sustained focus on serving the economically significant and priority sectors, including agriculture and SME sectors, through product diversification and customer awareness, acquisition and facilitation approaches:
- - Actively participated in the ‘Risk Coverage Scheme for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)’ introduced by the Government of Pakistan; in collaboration with SBP. The scheme is part of the ongoing concerted efforts on a national scale to expand size of SME financing in the country. Since introduction in mid-year, the Bank has disbursed Rs. 32.63 million to SMEs, as at December 31, 2024.
- The Bank’s total SME book size stood at Rs. 16,835 million.
- The Bank surpassed its regulatory target for agriculture credit disbursements in 2024; with total disbursements being recorded at Rs. 175,204 million. The Bank is also on track to achieve the disbursement target for 2025; which would translate into a robust growth rate of more than 20% in credit disbursements.

Facilitation of overseas Pakistanis under the RDA initiative and other national financial inclusion/support initiatives have remained a key focus area for the Bank. During the year under review, the Bank successfully handled a volume of over 13.5 million in home remittance transactions, attracting cumulative inflows in excess of USD 4.5 billion.

# Financial Inclusion Initiatives

MCB’s contribution to the cause of empowering individuals, segments and communities, with the knowledge and tools needed to make informed financial decisions, was also recognized in the inaugural event of Pakistan Financial Literacy Week (PFLW); wherein MCB was awarded the prestigious ‘Financial Literacy Champion Bank’ award in big banks category by the SBP.

Inculcated sustainability considerations into the overall credit assessment process within the purview of SBP’s ‘Environmental and Social Risk Management’ implementation strategy. This transition is essential for supporting the national agenda of a resilient and sustainable economy. As at December 31, 2024, following milestones have been successfully met under various phases of ESRM implementation:

- The Bank has developed its ‘Green Banking Policy’ and ESRM implementation manual. Additionally, an ESRM department has also been setup as a separate function.
- The Bank has started screening loan files on ESRM related requirements; in parallel to the conventional credit risk management procedures. The screening process has been completely rolled out on Bank’s outstanding exposure in top 7 industries and the Bank has been regularly reporting ESRM related quantitative data to the SBP.

MCB’s outstanding performance was also acknowledged in the 4th edition of Pakistan Remittance Summit; wherein the Bank was recognized as the third largest bank in country’s remittance market. This accolade underscores Bank’s efforts to promote financial inclusion, facilitate remittances and contribute to the country’s economic growth.

In 2023, as part of the RAAST implementation project, SBP announced formal rollout of the person to merchant (P2M) service in order to accelerate the pace of digital payment acceptance and digitization of merchant and businesses transactions in the country. MCB, remaining steadfast in its commitment to support the national drive towards digital transformation, successfully rolled out P2M service during the year in review. As of December 31, 2024, the Bank had achieved an aggregate onboarding of 252 merchants on its network whereas the total transactional volume generated since formal service rollout has exceeded Rs. 60 million.

# Economy Review

# Global Economy

In 2024, the global economy faced a confluence of challenges that tested its resilience; ranging from geopolitical tensions to extreme weather events. These challenges presented themselves amidst the underlying currents of easing monetary policies and general elections across the world, while the megatrend of artificial intelligence (AI) continued to underpin transformative development globally. These factors not only highlighted vulnerabilities across various sectors but also uncovered new opportunities.

Geopolitical events posed significant risks in 2024. The ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict and the war in the Middle East weighed heavily on the world’s energy supply. The Russian energy supply disruptions are being felt sharply by the Europeans. Beyond these conflicts, political uncertainty took center stage as over 100 countries conducted elections, including the United States.

Amidst this backdrop, global growth softened. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated a world growth rate of 3.2% for 2024, marginally lower than 2023’s global growth rate of 3.3%. Rising credit costs curtailed corporate and consumer spending, while governments grappled with escalating debt burdens, leading to reduced fiscal expenditures. Weak demand in China, coupled with volatility in energy markets, added further pressure. Oil prices swung between USD 69 and USD 91 per barrel, ultimately declining by 3% for the year. Meanwhile, gold re-emerged as a safe haven, surging by an impressive 27%.

On a positive note, advancements in artificial intelligence reshaped industries, with healthcare and manufacturing leading the charge. AI-driven efficiencies bolstered corporate earnings, particularly in the technology sector, and reflected in the robust performance of global equity markets. Wall Street saw the S&P 500 and NASDAQ index climb by 24% and 30%, respectively, while European markets also recorded gains, with the exception of the CAC 40 index, which was weighed down by political instability. Regional markets were similarly upbeat, with Pakistan’s KSE100 index delivering an exceptional 84% annual gain, setting a benchmark for peers.

Despite these gains, climate resilience emerged as a pressing concern in 2024. Extreme weather events—including devastating floods in South Asia and record-breaking heatwaves across Europe—inflicted billions of dollars in economic damage. The urgency of addressing climate change transitioned from a distant priority to an immediate imperative, prompting businesses and governments to focus on sustainability.

Monetary policy easing provided a silver lining. Declining inflation and improving economic indicators allowed central banks in developed and emerging markets to adopt accommodative stances. Interest rate cuts in the United States, Euro Area, China, and the United Kingdom provided much-needed liquidity to stabilize economies.

## Chunk 333

# Domestic Economy

The year 2024 brought political stability and encouraging economic developments for Pakistan. Economically, Pakistan made significant strides. The country initiated a USD 7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) agreement with the IMF in September, succeeding the prior USD 3 billion program. Spanning 37 months, this facility underscores Pakistan’s commitment to fiscal discipline and structural reforms.

On the monetary front, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) slashed interest rates by a cumulative 900 basis points since June 2024. The policy rate fell from 22% to 13% by December 2024, driven by declining inflation, external stability, and favorable commodity prices. Subsequently, in January 2025, the SBP has further reduced the policy rate by 100 basis points to 12%. CPI inflation dropped dramatically from 29.7% YoY in December 2023 to 4.1% YoY by December 2024, signaling a return to economic normalcy.

Encouragingly, the Current Account recorded a surplus of USD 1.2 billion in the first half of FY2025, supported by robust exports and workers’ remittances totaling USD 20.3 billion and USD 17.8 billion respectively. Foreign exchange reserves rose to USD 15.93 billion by December 2024, up from USD 12.67 billion a year earlier, stabilizing the PKR/USD exchange rate.

Despite these gains, challenges persist. Pakistan continued to face an energy crisis fueled by circular debt, high electricity costs, and dependence on imported fuels. The government-initiated renegotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs), terminating agreements and focusing on improving transmission and distribution efficiencies.

Revenue shortfalls also posed a hurdle. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) reported a deficit of Rs. 386 billion during the first half of FY2025, attributed to fluctuating imports, inflationary pressures, and changes in large-scale manufacturing. To address this shortfall, the government must enhance tax collection, widen the tax base and improve compliance to meet IMF benchmarks.

## Chunk 334

# Future Outlook of the Economy

Looking ahead, global growth is projected to remain steady at 3.3% in 2025, according to the IMF. While monetary easing and declining inflation may bolster economic activity, persistent risks from geopolitical conflicts, trade tensions, and elevated debt levels present significant headwinds, particularly for vulnerable economies.

Annual Report 2024

For Pakistan, the IMF forecasts modest growth of 3% for FY2025, with the World Bank projecting a slightly lower estimate of 2.8%. Key risks to economic recovery include geopolitical tensions, social unrest, and extreme weather events. Inflation is expected to average between 5.5% and 7.5%, though potential tax increases and tariff rebasing may exert upward pressure.

To sustain recovery, Pakistan must prioritize fiscal consolidation, reduce circular debt, and improve tax collection by targeting untapped sectors. Privatization of state-owned enterprises and streamlining provincial expenditures can alleviate fiscal burdens, while investments in agricultural technology can enhance crop yields and GDP. An export-driven growth strategy will be critical to improving long-term economic prospects of the country.

# Retail Banking Group

The year 2024 presented a stark contrast between its first and second halves. Unlike the first half, the latter part of the year benefited from easing inflation, stable PKR/FCY parity, and a sharp decline in the discount rate. This shift created a unique set of opportunities and challenges, testing our resilience and commitment. However, the seasoned Retail Banking team demonstrated its ability to deliver under all circumstances.

To enhance synergies, the Retail Banking Business and Operations teams were re-merged with a clear focus on service excellence, sustained deposit growth, improved governance, and operational efficiencies.

With a nationwide network of 1,384 branches and a dedicated team of over 9,300 employees, Retail Banking effectively served more than nine million bank accounts across all major economic geographies and business segments. Structurally, Retail Banking operates through North, Central, and South streams, led by Retail Banking Heads who manage 19 Circles, while Branch Operations are divided into eight Areas supervised by Area Heads of Services to ensure business effectiveness and governance.

A key focus in 2024 was the sustained growth of current and low-cost deposits, the expansion of the customer base through new account openings, the reactivation of dormant relationships, and quality growth in both assets and trade finance. These achievements were driven by relentless sales efforts, strong governance, the introduction of new and revamped products, and continuous process improvements.

As the largest contributor to both deposits and revenue of the Bank, the passionate Retail Banking team played a critical role in building impressive levels of Current Account (CA) deposits and significantly strengthening the CASA mix, which stood at 99% in 2024. In line with its commitment to environmental sustainability under its Green Banking initiative, 274 branches were converted to solar energy.

Furthermore, to elevate the banking experience for high-net-worth individuals, MCB Bank introduced Privilege Lounges at flagship residential and commercial branches.

With NPLs in the financial sector surpassing Rs. 1 trillion as of September 30, 2024, regulators have raised concerns.

As a key strategic partner to the Business, the Operations Group envisions itself as a key enabler in enhancing customer and branch experiences through digitization, centralization, and strengthened internal controls. With a strong focus on improving process and cost efficiencies, business process re-engineering, and the effective utilization of technology, the Group continuously strives to foster agility and flexibility within its operations. By leveraging digitization and process optimization, it has significantly improved operational efficiency, reinforced governance, and optimized capacity. These initiatives seamlessly align with the Bank’s broader transformation objectives, positioning the Operations Group as a driving force behind innovation and operational excellence while fortifying its position as a control function.

The year 2024 was defined by a strong emphasis on digitization and centralization, with a significant milestone being the Centralization of Account Maintenance activity. Currently in its pilot phase across select branches, this initiative ensures that all customer profile changes, account activation requests and KYC reviews are routed to the Central Processing Unit (CPU) for independent validation through a system-driven workflow. Building upon the success of a comprehensive two-year Data Cleansing Exercise, this initiative will further strengthen data accuracy and operational reliability. By centralizing validation, the Bank aims to enhance control over customer data modifications and strengthen its governance, setting a new benchmark for operational excellence.

Further advancing its digitization agenda, the New Account Opening System underwent notable enhancements, optimizing workflow efficiency and system integrations to provide a seamless experience. Additionally, the system’s availability was extended to mobile tablets, enabling staff to facilitate account opening at customers’ doorsteps, enhancing accessibility and convenience.

The Bank’s management is responsible to establish and maintain an adequate and effective system of internal controls and procedures under the policies approved by the Board. The management is also responsible for evaluating effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control system that covers material matters through identification of control objectives as well as review of significant policies and procedures.

All significant / material findings of the internal audit activities are reported to the Board’s Audit Committee. The Audit Committee actively monitors implementation of internal controls to ensure that identified risks are mitigated to safeguard interest of the Bank.

Bank’s internal control system has been designed to identify and mitigate the risk of failure to achieve overall business objectives of the Bank. Internal controls and policies are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the Bank’s operations, reliability of financial information and compliance with applicable laws & regulations. However, it needs to be stated that systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

Senior management team, through different Management Sub-Committees, monitors resolution / compliance of issues identified by the Regulators, Statutory Auditors as well as Audit & RAR Group. Periodic meetings of these Management Sub-committees are held to ensure expeditious resolution / compliance of aforementioned issues. The performance of the Sub-committees is monitored by the President / CEO of the Bank.

In accordance with SBP’s directives and as stated earlier, the Bank has completed all stages of ICFR roadmap and a Long Form Report (LFR) on the assessment of Bank’s ICFR for the year 2023 issued by the statutory auditors has been submitted to SBP in compliance with its directives stated in OSED Circular No. 1 of 2014 dated February 07, 2014. None of the deficiencies identified had a material impact on Financial Reporting.

Based upon the results derived through ongoing testing of financial reporting controls and internal audits carried out during the year, the management considers that the Bank’s existing internal control system is adequate and has been effectively implemented and monitored. The management will continue enhancing its coverage and compliance with the SBP Guidelines on Internal Controls and further strengthening its control environment on an ongoing basis.

Concerted efforts are made by every Group to improve the control environment at grass root level by regularly reviewing and streamlining procedures to prevent and rectify control lapses as well as imparting training for improvement at various levels. Compliance & Controls Group (CCG), through its specialized teams and centralized automated solutions, also oversees adherence to the regulatory requirements, with specific emphasis on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Combatting the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) / Countering Proliferation Financing (CPF). In addition, CCG also leads the Management’s Committee on AML/CFT/CPF for oversight of ML/TF/PF risk and compliance with respect to relevant laws, regulations, policies and procedures including financial crime compliance management.

The scope of Audit & RAR Group, independent from the management, inter alia includes, review and assessment.

A review is limited primarily to inquiries of the Bank’s personnel and review of various documents prepared by the Bank to comply with the Regulations.

As a part of our audit of the financial statements we are required to obtain an understanding of the accounting and internal control systems sufficient to plan the audit and develop an effective audit approach. We are not required to consider whether the Board of Directors’ statement on internal control covers all risks and controls or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of such internal controls, the Bank’s corporate governance procedures and risks.

The Regulations require the Bank to place before the Audit Committee, and upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, place before the Board of Directors for their review and approval, its related party transactions. We are only required and have ensured compliance of this requirement to the extent of the approval of the related party transactions by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the Statement of Compliance does not appropriately reflect the Bank’s compliance, in all material respects, with the requirements contained in the Regulations as applicable to the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2024.

## Chunk 539

# Sustainability Reporting & Challenges

# 1. Measuring & Quantifying

- No unified or “universal” standard

The absence of a unified sustainability reporting standard has resulted in the emergence of numerous sustainability reporting frameworks, surveys, and initiatives to engage shareholders and data providers, each with its own approach and prerequisites. Consequently, banks frequently find themselves in the position of having to determine which sustainability aspects to emphasize, what to disclose, and which metrics to use. This lack of standardized sustainability reporting metrics poses a significant challenge, hindering performance comparison and decision-making for organizations and investors.
- Subjectivity and complexity

Sustainability factors encompass various performance measures. These are commonly referred to as qualitative and quantitative metrics or indicators that capture corporate sustainability performance. However, some of these factors are more subjective than others, making their measurement and quantification challenging; particularly relevant in the context of informal operating environments like in Pakistan.

---

## Chunk 540

# 2. Data Collection and Management

- Data fragmentation and silos

Manually gathering relevant sustainability data from diverse sources within the organization can be complex, particularly if the data is dispersed across departments and systems. Indeed, fragmentation seems to be the name of the game. Spreadsheets are prone to error, and disparate systems often have no way of speaking to one another (at least, not in a way that a human can readily comprehend). And, because data banks are siloed, integration or system interoperability is not readily available.
- Inefficient and convoluted workflows

Inefficient and complex workflows are one of the byproducts of the traditional siloing of sustainability related data. Because corporate sustainability is inherently a cross-functional exercise, nearly every department tends to oversee some aspect of it. From human resources to operations to finance, coordinating the data collection, reviews, and approval from these various teams can be arduous and prone to error.

252 Annual Report 2024

---

## Chunk 541

# Data complexity and scope

Sustainability reporting covers a broad spectrum of environmental, social, and governance issues, each with its own set of indicators and data requirements. Tracking and collecting data across these diverse dimensions can be complex and resource-intensive. In addition, relevant sustainability related data might be hard to come by: it may be proprietary, confidential, or difficult to access, particularly when it comes to supply chain information or indirect environmental and social impacts.

---

## Chunk 542

# 3. Stakeholder Engagement and Communication

# Diverse stakeholder groups

Sustainability reporting involves engaging with a wide range of stakeholders, including investors, employees, customers, communities, NGOs, and regulatory bodies.

Waste is a major hazard to health of employees and aesthetics of the organizations. MCB Bank focuses on waste reduction for environmental improvement and workforce productivity.

MCB Bank is moving towards paperless banking and resource efficiency in our operations. Some of our notable initiatives include reduction of environmental footprint in energy efficiency in offices, greening of office premises and developing a culture of self-segregation of waste into dry and wet waste streams at source.

We ensure our wet waste including kitchen and organic materials are responsibly led to the landfills with minimum impact to the natural environment. To enhance awareness and behavior change of employees and staff, formal and informal channels of corporate communications and campaigns are run to encourage staff to take actions, such as tree plantation and awareness walks.

Partnership building is very important for environmental sustainability. Therefore, we are keen to develop impactful collaboration with civil society organizations such as Amal who are facilitating us to run MCB Bank’s Green Office Program and achieve Net Zero objective.

Plantation within the commercial business premises/branches is encouraged by the Senior Management. Emails through corporate communication are circulated to each staff, to maintain high standard of cleanliness inside/outside of office buildings/premises.

# Solarization

As a resolve to its commitment for energy conservation and green banking, the Bank continued to implement clean energy projects for solarization of branches during the year. Owing to the mega project launched in 2023, the total number of solarized branches soared to 275 at year end as compared to 43 last year with an accumulated installed solar capacity at 4.030 MW. This resulted in generation of approx. 2,744 MW of clean energy, leading to a reduction of approx. 1,646 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. The provision of solar systems will not only contribute to a cleaner environment but also reduce overall energy cost.

On the buildings side, we successfully commissioned a 60.5kW On Grid solar power plant at our iconic MCB Landmark building in Islamabad during the previous year. Advancing on this momentum, we solarized key buildings in Lahore and Karachi during 2024. Notably, our MCB building on Shahrah-e-Aiwan-e-Tijarat, Lahore, became our largest solarized site with the installation of a 102kW On Grid solar system, and estimated annual generation capacity of approximately 140MWh units. Additionally, we equipped MCB Nila Gumbad building in Lahore with a 55.8kW solar system and MCB Guest House in Karachi with a 34.5kW system. We continue to explore opportunities for further solarization, with surveys conducted for flagship buildings such as MCB Head Office, MCB Contact Center, MCB DHA Phase VIII, and MCB Schon Circle Clifton. Feasibility reports are currently under review.

These initiatives demonstrate our commitment to environmental sustainability, corporate social responsibility, and adherence to the State Bank's Green Banking Guidelines. The MCB Bank management appreciates the cooperation it has received from its employees and the interest shown by its stakeholders in adopting the responsible and ethical business practices.

# Embrace Sustainability as a Core Strategy

The Bank has integrated environmental and social considerations into decision-making processes relating to the business activities to avoid, minimize, and offset negative impacts. For the environmental and social due diligence of customers, the Bank has developed and implemented a new rating model; namely the Environmental & Social Risk Rating (ESRR) Model. This will enforce a restriction on providing for or funding businesses that pose a threat to the environment or community in which they reside.

For MCB, delivering on our ESG strategy by accelerating climate action, creating access to opportunities, and building integrity and trust often requires innovative thinking and challenging the traditional ways of doing things. In 2023, the Bank took an initiative for green energy via the installation of solar panels at its branches. By the end of 2024, the Bank has successfully converted 275 branches on clean green energy and plans to convert an additional approximately 30 branches, in 2025, under the solarization initiative. In addition, traditional lights and equipment are being replaced by LED and inverter-based technology.

By rigorously implementing our sustainability strategy, we have made substantial progress in integrating sustainability into our business and operating model. Sustainability practices will help to reduce the carbon footprint, energy cost, mitigate risks associated with regulatory non-compliance, reputational damage and attract socially conscious investors thus reflecting a positive impact on the Bank’s financial performance and goodwill.

Additionally, MCB Bank continued to invest in training and development programs specifically designed to equip women with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in their roles and advance their careers within the organization.

# Green Banking

“Green Banking” refers to the integration of environmentally sustainable practices into the banking sector. It involves adopting eco-friendly initiatives in banking operations, offering financial products that support environmental sustainability, and promoting green investments. In Pakistan, where environmental challenges such as air pollution, water scarcity, and deforestation are pressing issues, green banking has emerged as a crucial tool for mitigating climate change and fostering sustainable development. Adopting green banking practices helps financial institutions comply with global environmental standards and regulations, and mitigate risks associated with climate-related investments and disasters.

In Pakistan, the urgency to address environmental issues has intensified, with significant concerns around climate change, environmental degradation, and social inequality impacting the nation. In response, the concept of Green Banking has gained momentum as a way for financial institutions to align their activities with the broader goal of sustainable development. The Environmental & Social Risk Management (ESRM) Implementation Manual provides a framework for integrating environmental and social risks into banking practices, aiming to strengthen the financial sector’s capacity to manage these critical challenges.

In 2024, MCB continued integrating sustainable banking practices, effectively minimizing environmental risks while fostering responsible financial management across all business operations and internal processes. MCB strongly aligned its strategies with SBP’s efforts to decarbonize Pakistan’s economy. The bank updated its Green Banking policy to incorporate the latest amendments, particularly emphasizing the inclusion of social risks alongside environmental concerns.

The bank’s core objective is to fortify its operations against the growing environmental and social risks increasingly affecting financial markets. Moreover, MCB Bank remains fully committed to accelerating the integration of sustainable practices within its operations by leveraging technology and sustainable infrastructure to reduce its carbon footprint.

# Issues Raised in the Last Annual General Meeting (AGM)

The proceedings of the 76th Annual General Meeting of the shareholders of MCB Bank Limited was held on Wednesday, March 27, 2024 at 11:00 am (PST), Nishat Hotel, Lahore. Mian Mohammad Mansha, the Chairman of Board of Directors, presided over the meeting. The meeting was attended by Board members of the Bank, including the Chief Executive Officer, along with Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the Company Secretary.

The Company Secretary invited the CFO to present key highlights of the audited financial statements for the year 2023 and elucidate on the salient features of Banks’ performance. There were no significant issues raised in the last AGM that are pending implementation, however, the shareholders while appreciating the overall growth in Bank’s financial performance sought some general clarifications and comments on the progress of the Bank.

Citing the exceptional growth in Bank’s total income and its consequent translation into an 82% growth in Profit after Taxation (PAT), one of the shareholders enquired about the future outlook for Bank’s revenue streams. Responding to the query, CFO apprised the forum that the 600bps increase in policy rate announced by SBP, during 2023, has created positive real rates on a 12-month forward looking basis. These rates are excepted to bring the inflation down, barring any unforeseen shocks, and hence, the Bank expects the accommodative monetary cycle to follow. The easing interest rates will ultimately have a narrowing effect on Bank’s earnings margins and its Net Interest Income. However, the Bank maintains its positive outlook for Non Interest Income as the focus on introduction of new products and services coupled with remote and digital banking initiatives is likely to help the Bank in maintaining traction in the recently witnessed growth momentum.

The CEO informed the shareholders that the Bank remains a well-capitalized institution with a capital base well above the regulatory limits and Basel capital requirements. He also mentioned that the Bank had one of the highest cash dividends per share in the industry and remained one of the prime stocks traded in Pakistan equity market, which is appropriately reflected in its market capitalization; one of the highest in the financial institution category as at December 31, 2023.

The shareholders appreciated the services of the Board of Directors for its visionary approach and collective wisdom reflected in the sound financial performance of the Bank.

# Summary of the Analyst Briefings

The idea behind the Bank’s investor engagement through these briefings is to give the right perspective of the business affairs of the Bank to the investors (both existing and potential) which help them in making their investment decisions.

The Bank conducts quarterly analyst briefings in order to share details pertaining to results announced and to respond to any queries of analysts relating to results and future prospects.

Face to face discussions have also been arranged with foreign analysts as and when required. The briefing further envisages our transparent and continuously evolving stakeholders’ engagement approach.

Briefing is being held vide teleconferencing and during the year following analysts briefing were held;

We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants as adopted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (the Code) and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key Audit Matter(s)

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# Key Audit Matter

# How the matter was addressed in our audit

Under IFRS 9, the Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the Expected Credit Losses (ECL) associated with all advances and other debt financial assets not held at fair value through profit and loss, together with letters of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments. A lifetime ECL is recorded on advances in which there have been Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) from the date of initial recognition and on advances which are credit impaired as on the reporting date. A 12 months ECL is recorded for advances which do not meet the criteria for SICR or "credit impaired" as at the reporting date. To assess whether there is a significant increase in the credit risk, the Bank compares the risk of a default occurring on the advances as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. Both lifetime and 12 months ECL are calculated at facility level. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account and is decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries.

The Bank records charge for Stage 3 based on the higher of provision under Prudential Regulations or ECL under IFRS 9, as per the instructions of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). This assessment is conducted at the borrower/facility level for corporate, commercial, retail and consumer portfolios. If one facility of a counterparty becomes more than 90 days past due or is otherwise defined as impaired under Prudential Regulations, all other facilities of that counterparty are classified as Stage 3.

The measurement of ECL involves evaluating a range of possible outcomes, considering the time value of money, and incorporating reasonable and supportable information available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The net provision made/reversed during the year is charged to the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account and accumulated provision is netted-off against advances. The Bank has recognised a net credit loss allowance/provision against advances (including general provision) amounting to Rs. 4,757.706 million in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account in the current year. As at December 31, 2024, the Bank holds a credit loss allowance/provision of Rs. 44,738.996 million against advances. In addition, the Bank has also maintained a general reserve of Rs. 8,456.884 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 2,624.303 million) against advances/financing made in accordance with the prevailing circumstances as mentioned in note 6.1.1.5 to the unconsolidated financial statements.

# Key Audit Matter

|S. No.|Key Audit Matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|The determination of credit loss allowance / provision against advances based on the above criteria remains a significant area of judgment and estimation. Because of the significance of the impact of these judgments / estimations and the materiality of advances relative to the overall unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank, we considered this area as a key audit matter.|• We issued instructions to auditors of those overseas branches which were selected for audit, highlighting ‘Credit loss allowance against advances’ as a significant risk. The auditors of those branches performed audit procedures to check compliance with regulatory requirements and reported the results thereof to us. We, as auditors of the Bank, evaluated the work performed by the component auditors and the results thereof.|

# Information Other than the Unconsolidated and Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Reports Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the unconsolidated and consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s reports thereon.

Our opinion on the unconsolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the unconsolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

---

## Chunk 659

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the unconsolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.

## Chunk 660

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.

# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

1. Based on our audit, we further report that in our opinion:
- proper books of account have been kept by the Bank as required by the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and the returns referred above from the branches have been found adequate for the purpose of our audit;
- the unconsolidated statement of financial position, the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account, the unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated statement of changes in equity and unconsolidated cash flow statement together with the notes thereon have been drawn up in conformity with the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and are in agreement with the books of account and returns;
- investments made, expenditure incurred and guarantees extended during the year were in accordance with the objects and powers of the Bank and the transactions of the Bank which have come to our notice have been within the powers of the Bank; and
- zakat deductible at source under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance, 1980 (XVIII of 1980), was deducted by the Bank and deposited in the Central Zakat Fund established under section 7 of that Ordinance.
2. We confirm that for the purpose of our audit we have covered more than sixty percent of the total loans and advances of the Bank.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Hammad Ali Ahmad.

# 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

2.1 These unconsolidated financial statements represent the separate financial statements of MCB Bank Limited. The consolidated financial statements of the Group are being issued separately.

2.2 The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 09, 2023, issued the revised forms for the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements of banks, with further addition made vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 13 of 2024, dated July 01, 2024 that are applicable for quarterly / half yearly / annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 as per BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023. The implementation of the revised forms has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the unconsolidated financial statements. The significant change is relating to right of use assets and corresponding lease liability which are now presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position; as disclosed in note 50. Previously, these were presented under property and equipment (earlier titled as fixed assets) and other liabilities respectively. There is no impact of this change on the unconsolidated financial statements in terms of recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities.

# 3. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

# 3.1

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards comprise of:

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the SBP and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IFRS or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

The State Bank of Pakistan has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standards 40, ‘Investment Property’ for Banking Companies through BSD Circular No. 10 dated August 26, 2002. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has deferred applicability of IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” on banks through S.R.O 411(1) /2008 dated April 28, 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements.

IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements” was made applicable from period beginning on or after January 01, 2015 vide S.R.O 633(I)/2014 dated July 10, 2014 by SECP. However, SECP has directed through S.R.O 56(I) /2016 dated January 28, 2016, that the requirements of consolidation under section 237 of the repealed Companies Ordinance 1984 (Section 228 of Companies Act 2017) and IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements” is not applicable in case of investment by companies in mutual funds established under Trust structure.

# 3.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of unconsolidated financial statements in conformity with the approved accounting standards requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Bank’s accounting policies. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experiences, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Critical accounting estimates and judgements applied in application of IFRS 9 have been disclosed under note 6.1. Other major areas where various assumptions and estimates are significant to the Bank’s financial statements or where judgment was exercised in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

# a) Taxation

In making the estimates for income taxes currently payable by the Bank, the management considers the current income tax laws and the decisions of appellate authorities on certain issues in the past.

---

## Chunk 677

# b) Fair value of derivatives

The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currency involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration etc.

---

## Chunk 678

# c) Depreciation, amortisation, impairment and revaluation of property and equipment

The management reviews the useful lives and residual values of assets annually by considering expected pattern of economic benefit that the management expects to derive from the item and the maximum period up to which such benefits are expected to be available. Any change in estimates in future years might affect the carrying amounts of the respective items of assets with a corresponding effect on the depreciation charge and impairment. Such change is accounted for as change in accounting estimates in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors”. Further, the Bank estimates the revalued amount of land and buildings on a regular basis. The estimates are based on valuations carried out by independent professional valuers under the market conditions.

---

## Chunk 679

# d) Staff retirement benefits

Certain actuarial assumptions have been adopted as disclosed in note 40 of these unconsolidated financial statements for the actuarial valuation of staff retirement benefit plans. Actuarial assumptions are entity’s best estimates of the variables that will determine the ultimate cost of providing post employment benefits. Changes in these assumptions in future years may affect the liability / asset under these plans in those years.

## Chunk 680

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

# e) Lease term for lease liability and right–of–use asset

The Bank applies judgment to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right–of–use assets recognized.

---

## Chunk 681

# f) Provision and contingent assets and liabilities

Provisions are recognized when the Bank has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. Contingent assets are not recognized and are also not disclosed until an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognized and are disclosed unless the probability of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.

---

## Chunk 682

# 4. BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except that certain classes of property and equipment and non–banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are stated at revalued amounts; investments classified at fair value through profit and loss and fair value through other comprehensive income; foreign exchange contracts and derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value; defined benefit obligations are carried at present value; right of use of asset and related lease liability are measured at present value on initial recognition; and staff loans and subsidised loans disbursed under Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) are measured at fair value on initial recognition.

# 5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

These risk management policies continue to remain robust and the Bank is reviewing its portfolio regularly in line with the emerging risks. Detailed disclosure on financial risk management has been reported in note 48 to the unconsolidated financial statements.

---

## Chunk 683

# 6. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the audited annual unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for changes mentioned in note 6.1.

---

## Chunk 684

# 6.1 IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’

As per the SBP BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ is applicable on banks with effect from January 01, 2024. The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard also introduces a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on a forward looking ‘Expected Credit Losses’ (ECL) approach rather than the ‘incurred credit losses’ approach as previously followed. The ECL approach has an impact on all assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

In preparation of these financial statements, the Bank has applied requirements of IFRS 9 and SBP’s IFRS 9 Application Instructions issued through BPRD Circular No. 03 dated July 05, 2022 from the date of initial application of January 01, 2024 with a modified retrospective approach for restatement. As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Bank has not restated comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognized in the opening retained earnings and other reserves at the beginning of the current year without restating the comparative figures.

The SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 19, 2024, and BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 dated January 22, 2025 has made certain amendments and clarified the timelines of some of the SBP’s IFRS 9 Application Instructions to address the matters raised by the banks to ensure.

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

Compliance by the timelines. The circulars have provided clarifications / relaxations on measurement of unquoted equity securities, modification accounting and maintenance of general provisions over and above ECL. Accordingly, the Bank has adopted the treatment as instructed in the aforementioned circulars in these unconsolidated financial statements.

On application of IFRS 9, certain accounting policies have been revised to comply with the requirements of IFRS 9. The revised accounting policies have been disclosed in their respective policy notes in these unconsolidated financial statements.

## Chunk 686

# 6.1.1 Application to the Bank’s financial assets

# 6.1.1.1 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

Financial assets are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Bank purchases or sells the asset. Other financial assets like advances, lending to financial institutions etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account or financial institutions. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased.

---

## Chunk 687

# a. Amortised cost (AC)

Financial assets under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in the statement of profit and loss account. Interest income / profit / expense on these assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the statement of profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 688

# b. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for debt based financial assets in the statement of profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of debt based financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the statement of profit and loss account and for equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is recognized directly in the statement of changes in equity.

---

## Chunk 689

# c. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs will be directly recorded in the statement of profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in the statement of profit and loss account. Interest / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the statement of profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

---

## Chunk 690

# 6.1.1.2 Classification and measurement

The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the business model within which they are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’) regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Bank’s business model in which financial assets are held determines whether the financial assets are measured at amortised cost (‘AC’), fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’).

Annual Report 2024

---

## Chunk 691

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

The business model reflects how groups of financial assets are managed to achieve a particular business objective. Debt based financial assets can only be held at amortised cost if these are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows (‘hold to collect’), and where those contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Assets may be sold out of ‘hold to collect’ portfolios where there is an increase in credit risk. Disposals for other reasons are permitted but such sales should be insignificant in value or infrequent in nature.

Debt based financial assets where the business model objectives are achieved by collecting the contractual cash flows and by selling the assets (‘hold to collect and sell’) and that have SPPI cash flows are measured at FVOCI, with unrealized gains or losses deferred in reserves until the asset is derecognized. The debt based financial assets that are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset at FVTPL that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI; if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

The classification of equity instruments is generally measured at FVTPL unless the Bank, at initial recognition, irrevocably designates the investment as FVOCI in which case, both the unrealized and realized gains or losses are recognized in reserves and no amounts other than dividends received are recognized in the statement of profit and loss account.

All other financial assets will mandatorily be held at FVTPL. Financial assets may be designated at FVTPL only if doing so eliminates or reduces an accounting mismatch.

The requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Bank which are explained as follows:

---

## Chunk 692

# a. Debt based financial assets previously classified as available for sale (AFS)

The application of IFRS 9 has resulted in classification and consequent remeasurement of investments in Islamic Naya Pakistan Certificates (INPC’s), amounting to Rs. 5,699.494 million, held under AFS portfolio as of December 31, 2023 to FVTPL based on their business model assessment.

The failure of SPPI test upon assessment of contractual cash flows of debt based financial assets has resulted in classification and consequent remeasurement of investments in certain Non Government debt securities, amounting to Rs. 2,950.890 million, to FVTPL.

All other debt based financial assets previously classified as AFS upon passing the SPPI test have been designated as FVOCI under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, but also to sell those investment. There is no change to their measurement basis and recognition of realized and unrealized gain / loss under IFRS 9.

---

## Chunk 693

# b. Debt based financial assets previously classified as held to maturity (HTM)

Debt based financial assets currently classified as HTM upon passing the SPPI test have been designated as amortised cost under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows. Investments in certain non government debt securities, amounting to Rs. 7,506.816 million, on failing the SPPI test have been reclassified to FVTPL.

# c. Equity instruments previously classified as available for sale (AFS)

The Bank has elected to irrevocably designate all quoted and unquoted equity securities previously classified as available for sale (AFS) as FVOCI except units of open end mutual funds, amounting to Rs. 115.980 million, that have been mandatorily classified as measured at FVTPL. The fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to statement of profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities.

IFRS 9 has eliminated impairment assessment requirements for investments in equity instruments. Accordingly, the Bank has reclassified impairment of Rs. 9,783.874 million on listed equity investments and Rs. 205.765 million for unlisted equity investments held as at December 31, 2023 to surplus / deficit on revaluation of investments.

## Chunk 697

# 6.1.1.4 Modification

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of financing to its customers. When the contractual cash flows of financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified and the renegotiation or modification does not result in derecognition of that financial asset in accordance with IFRS 9, the Bank recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset and shall recognize a modification gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss account. The gross carrying amount of the financial asset is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate (or credit–adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit–impaired financial assets). Any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the financial asset.

## Chunk 699

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

The Bank recognises a credit loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability–weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money; and
- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

## Chunk 700

# Staging criteria / Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR)

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Internal Credit Risk Rating (ICRR) or where principal and / or interest payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include restructuring, unavailability of financial information and pending litigations. Based on the level of increase in credit risk, the Bank shall calculate 12mECL for assets which did not have a SICR i.e., Stage 1 or a LTECL for the life of the asset (for assets which demonstrated a SICR) i.e., Stage 2.

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its financial instruments into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

---

## Chunk 701

# Stage 1:

When financial instruments are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECL. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to the Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected / forward looking Loss Given Default (LGD) and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

---

## Chunk 702

# Stage 2:

When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

# Stage 3:

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises the LTECLs for these instruments. The Bank uses a PD of 100% and the forward looking LGD as computed for each portfolio / segment.

## Chunk 703

# Guarantee & Letter of Credit contracts:

The Bank performs internal assessment and estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit contracts respectively. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of three scenarios. The ECLs related to guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within other liabilities.

# Portfolio Segmentation

For assessment of significant deterioration in credit risk and estimation of corresponding risk parameters, financial instruments have been grouped together based on their shared risk characteristics to collectively assess for significant credit risk deterioration.

## Chunk 705

# ECL Measurement Models

# – Probability of Default (PD):

The Probability of default (PD) represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation, either over the next 12 months, or over the remaining lifetime (Lifetime PD) of the obligation.

For loans and advances, PD estimation is based on the historic transitions of segmented obligors from one credit state/rating to another credit state/rating. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal credit risk ratings (i.e. from ICRR 1 to ICRR 12). In order to convert historic trends to forward-looking; PD’s are weighted by considering key macro-economic drivers affecting credit ratings i.e. (Gross Domestic Product, Consumer Price Index, Volume of Export of Goods, Unemployment).

For other financial assets (i.e. investments, lending to financial institutions, balances with other banks etc.), historical PDs have been estimated on the basis of global default Rates taken from S&P rating-wise transition matrices. These annual default rates have then been converted into forward-looking point in time PDs using the Vasicek model.

---

## Chunk 706

# – Exposure at Default (EAD):

Exposure at default (EAD) represents the amount of potential exposure that is at risk. The estimation of EAD considers any expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including expected drawdowns on committed facilities through the application of a credit conversion factor (CCF). The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has a legal right to call it earlier. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Bank does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the Bank’s expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the Bank’s future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

---

## Chunk 707

# – Loss Given Default (LGD):

LGD represents an estimate of the loss incurred on a facility in the event of default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive. It is expressed as a percentage of the EAD. The LGDs are determined using workout approach, based on vintage recovery data for the defaulted portfolio; these recoveries are then discounted back to date of default, to factor in time value of money.

The Bank has converted the estimates for segment/product wise historical LGDs (Through the cycle LGDs) into forward looking point in time LGDs using the Jacob Frye model; that estimates LGD as an increasing function of default rate.

---

## Chunk 708

# The calculation of ECLs

The ECL is determined by projecting the PD, LGD and EAD for each future repayment date and for each individual exposure. These three components are multiplied together, effectively calculating an ECL for each future repayment date, which is then discounted back to the reporting date and summed.

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities; effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

---

## Chunk 709

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level.

When estimating the ECLs, in addition to the base economic scenario, the Bank considers three scenarios (a base case, an upside, a downside). Each of these is associated with different PDs. The number of scenarios and their attributes are reassessed at each reporting date. The scenario weightings are determined by a combination of statistical analysis and expert credit judgment, taking account of the range of possible outcomes each chosen scenario is representative of.

The Bank’s management has only considered cash, liquid securities and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals, while calculating EADs.

The credit exposure (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

---

## Chunk 710

# General provisions over and above the ECL

ECL calculation under IFRS 9 involves evaluation against multiple qualitative and quantitative parameters, including forward looking estimates, and hence demands a considerable amount of subjectivity. Considering the volatility in current operating and macroeconomic environment, the sensitivity in ECL models could lead to significant variations in the ECL charge reported for comparative periods. In order to overcome this volatility, the Bank has set a minimum threshold for ECL recognition against advances and non–funded exposure classified in Stage 1 and Stage 2. SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 dated January 22, 2025 has permitted banks to maintain general provisions, over and above the ECL worked out for Stage 1 and Stage 2, up to December 31, 2026.

---

## Chunk 711

# For Advances:

# Stage 1:

ECL allowance has been recognized based on IFRS 9 principles. In case, IFRS 9 provision is less than 1% of gross advances classified under Stage 1, the Bank maintains a general reserve over and above the IFRS 9 based ECL. The general reserve is being maintained as the difference between 1% of gross advances classified under Stage 1 and ECL computed under IFRS 9 principles.

---

## Chunk 712

# Stage 2:

ECL allowance has been recognized based on IFRS 9 principles. In case, IFRS 9 provision is less than 5% of gross advances classified under Stage 2, the Bank maintains a general reserve over and above the IFRS 9 based ECL. The general reserve is being maintained as the difference between 5% of gross advances classified under Stage 2 and ECL computed under IFRS 9 principles.

---

## Chunk 713

# For Non–Funded Credit Exposure:

# Stage 1:

ECL allowance has been recognized based on IFRS 9 principles. In case, IFRS 9 provision is less than 0.20% of non–funded exposure classified under Stage 1, the Bank maintains a general reserve over and above the IFRS 9 based ECL. The general reserve is being maintained as the difference between 0.20% of non–funded exposure classified under Stage 1 and ECL computed under IFRS 9 principles.

---

## Chunk 714

# Stage 2:

ECL allowance has been recognized based on IFRS 9 principles. In case, IFRS 9 provision is less than 0.50% of non–funded exposure classified under Stage 2, the Bank maintains a general reserve over and above the IFRS 9 based ECL. The general reserve is being maintained as the difference between 0.50% of non–funded exposure classified under Stage 2 and ECL computed under IFRS 9 principles.

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

# Backward Transition

In line with Bank’s IFRS 9 Policy and Regulatory guidelines, financial assets shall be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they fulfill the criteria outlined in the Prudential Regulations (PR) issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Similarly, financial assets classified under Stage 2 shall be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) no longer exist. However, a minimum period of three months, as approved by the Board of Directors, from the initial downgrade is mandatory before any facility can be moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2.

For a facility to transition from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it must meet the declassification requirements specified in the relevant Prudential Regulations. An exposure cannot be directly upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1; instead, it must first transition to Stage 2 and subsequently complete a cooling–off period of three months before being reclassified to Stage 1.

---

## Chunk 716

# Impact on Regulatory Capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the Banks, which has affected their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL provisioning, a transitional arrangement is allowed to the banks to absorb impact on regulatory capital; in accordance with SBP’s Guideline for absorption of ECL for CAR Purposes as mentioned in Annexure C of BPRD Circular No 3 of 2022. However, the Bank has not availed benefit of captioned transitional arrangement in regulatory capital.

---

## Chunk 717

# 6.1.1.6 Definition of default

The concept of ‘impairment or default’ is critical to the implementation of IFRS 9 as it drives determination of risk parameters, i.e. PD, LGD and EAD. The Bank has defined that an exposure with regards to a particular obligor will be treated as having defaulted when either one or both of the following two events have taken place:

- If a customer fails to service mark–up and / or principal within days past due (DPD) criteria as prescribed by SBP from time to time;
- The Bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realizing security (if held).

# 6.1.1.7 Write–offs

The Bank’s accounting policy under IFRS 9 remains the same as it was under SBP regulations / existing reporting framework.

---

## Chunk 718

# 6.1.2 Application to the Bank’s financial liabilities

The accounting for financial liabilities remain largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus financial liabilities are being carried at amortised cost except for derivatives that has been measured at fair value.

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non–cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the statement of profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 719

# 6.1.3 Adoption Impacts

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 effective from January 01, 2024 with modified retrospective approach as permitted under IFRS 9. The cumulative impact of initial application of Rs. 4,320.177 million has been recorded as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of the current accounting period. The details of the impacts of initial application are tabulated below:

# 6.2 IFRS 16 – Lease Liability & Right–of–Use Assets

The Bank enters into leasing arrangements of buildings for its branches and offices. Rental contracts are typically for a fixed period and may have extension options. At inception of a contract, the Bank assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease based on whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the Banks’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The carrying amount is remeasured / adjusted if there are changes in the future cash flows or the lease term.

The right–of–use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date. On subsequent measurement, right–of–use assets are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation / accumulated impairment losses and are adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.

Right–of–use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term as this method closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits. Carrying amount of the lease liability is derecognized upon termination of the lease contract with corresponding adjustment to right–of–use asset. Gain or loss on termination of lease contract is recognized in the statement of profit and loss account.

The Bank has elected not to recognize a right–of–use asset and the corresponding lease liability for short–term leases with terms of 12 months or less and leases of low–value assets. Payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense in the statement of profit or loss account on a straight–line basis.

When there is a change in scope of a lease, or the consideration for a lease, that was not part of the original terms and conditions of the lease, it is accounted for as a lease modification. The lease modification is accounted for as a separate lease if modification increases the scope of lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets and the consideration for lease increases by an amount that is commensurate with the stand–alone price for the increase in scope adjusted to reflect the circumstances of the particular contracts, if any. When the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, the lease liability is remeasured and corresponding adjustment is made to right–of–use asset.

# 6.3 Investments

Investments include Federal Government securities, shares, mutual fund units, non–Government debt securities, foreign securities, associates and subsidiaries. Classification and measurement of investments has been detailed in note 6.1.

## Chunk 724

# 6.3.1 Investments in Subsidiaries and Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Bank has significant influence but not control. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Bank has the power to govern the financial and operating policies accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. Investments in subsidiaries and investments in associates are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Impairment against investment in subsidiaries and associates is assessed as per the requirements of IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’.

Securities sold subject to a repurchase agreement (repo) are retained in these unconsolidated financial statements as investments and the counter party liability is included in borrowings, unless the securities qualify for derecognition upon transfer of substantial risks and rewards associated with the securities to the counter party. Securities purchased under an agreement to resell (reverse repo) are not recognized in these unconsolidated financial statements as investments and the amount extended to the counter party is included in lending’s to financial institutions. The difference between the purchase / sale and re–sale / re–purchase price is recognized as mark–up income / expense on a time proportion basis, as the case may be.

# 6.5 Loans and advances

Loans and advances including net investment in finance lease are stated net of credit loss allowance and general reserve / provision. Credit loss allowance against loans and advances have been made in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations, IFRS 9 application instructions and various circulars issued by the SBP from time to time. The Bank also maintains a general reserve against loans and advances, over and above the IFRS 9 based ECL, as permitted by SBP under BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 dated January 22, 2025.

Staff loans and subsidised loans disbursed under Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) have been recorded at fair value resulting in recognition of fair value adjustment on initial recognition. Unwinding of income on fair value adjustment is recognised in the statement of profit and loss account. Leases where the Bank transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. A receivable is recognized at an amount equal to the present value of the lease payments including any guaranteed residual value. Finance lease receivables are included in advances to the customers.

Advances are written off / charged off when there are no realistic prospects of recovery or to clean up the balance sheet as allowed by the SBP.

---

## Chunk 727

# 6.6 Property and equipment and depreciation

Property and equipment other than land and buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Buildings are carried at revalued amount less any accumulated depreciation and subsequent impairment losses, if any. Land is carried at revalued amount less any subsequent impairment losses, if any. Cost of property and equipment of foreign operations includes exchange differences arising on currency translation at year–end rates.

Capital work–in–progress is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. These are transferred to specific assets as and when assets become available for use. Depreciation on all property and equipment (excluding land) is charged using the straight line method in accordance with the rates specified in note 12.2 to these unconsolidated financial statements and after taking into account residual value, if any. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.

Depreciation on additions is charged from the month the assets are available for use while no depreciation is charged in the month in which the assets are disposed off. Land and buildings are revalued by independent, professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. An increase arising on revaluation is credited to the surplus on revaluation of property and equipment account. A decrease arising on revaluation of property and equipment is adjusted against the surplus of that asset or, if no surplus exists, is charged to the statement of profit and loss account as an impairment of the asset. A surplus arising subsequently on an impaired asset is reversed through the statement of profit and loss account up to the extent of the original impairment.

## Chunk 728

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

Surplus on revaluation of property and equipment (net of associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit. Gains / losses on sale of property and equipment are credited / charged to the statement of profit and loss account currently, except that the related surplus on revaluation of land and buildings (net of deferred taxation) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or are recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 729

# 6.7 Intangible assets

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets are amortized from the month when these assets are available for use, using the straight line method, whereby the cost of the intangible assets are amortized over its estimated useful lives over which economic benefits are expected to flow to the Bank. The useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.

---

## Chunk 730

# 6.8 Impairment

The carrying amount of assets are reviewed at each reporting date for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. If such indication exists and where the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount, assets are written down to their recoverable amounts. The resulting impairment loss is taken to the statement of profit and loss account except for impairment loss on revalued assets, which is adjusted against the related revaluation surplus to the extent that the impairment loss does not exceed the surplus on revaluation of that asset.

# 6.9 Staff retirement benefits

The Bank operates the following staff retirement benefits for its employees:

- a) For clerical / non–clerical staff who did not opt for the new scheme, the Bank operates the following:
- – an approved contributory provident fund;
- – an approved gratuity scheme; and
- – a contributory benevolent scheme
- b) For clerical / non–clerical staff who joined the Bank after the introduction of the new scheme and for others who opted for the new scheme introduced in 1975, the Bank operates the following:
- – an approved non–contributory provident fund introduced in lieu of the contributory provident fund;
- – an approved pension fund; and
- – contributory benevolent scheme
- c) For officers who joined the Bank after the introduction of the new scheme and for others who opted for the new scheme introduced in 1977, the Bank operates the following:
- – an approved non–contributory provident fund introduced in lieu of the contributory provident fund;
- – an approved pension fund, and
- – contributory benevolent fund.

However, the management has replaced the pension benefits for employees in the officer category with a contributory provident fund for services rendered after December 31, 2003.

e) Post retirement medical benefits to entitled employees. Annual contributions towards the defined benefit plans and schemes are made on the basis of actuarial advice using the Projected Unit Credit Method. The above benefits are payable to staff at the time of separation from the Bank’s services subject to the completion of qualifying period of service. Actuarial gains / losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in statement of comprehensive income in the period of occurrence.

Leasehold land includes a plot of land measuring 3,120.46 square yards having book value of Rs. 1,721.170 million situated at Railway Quarters, I.I. Chundrigar Road, Karachi, (the “Plot”), where a tenant is claiming for the possession of an insignificant area of only 18 square feet of the plot, however there is no dispute over the title of the subject property that would impact the right of the Bank. Both the Constitutional Petitions filed by the Bank have been dismissed by the Sindh High Court on January 28, 2016 against the Bank. The Bank has filed an appeal before the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

The land and buildings of the Bank were revalued as at December 31, 2022 by independent valuers (Pee Dee & Associates, J&M Associates, Tristar International Consultant (Pvt) Limited, Design Crafts, Ahmad Associates, Materials & Designs Services (Pvt) Limited and Dharmaratne Holdings (Pvt) Limited), valuation and engineering consultants, on the basis of market value. The total surplus against revaluation of fixed assets as at December 31, 2024 amounts to Rs. 39,032.404 million (2023: Rs. 39,331.254 million).

Had the land and buildings not been revalued, the total carrying amounts of revalued properties as at the reporting dates would have been as follows:

24.1 Under IFRS–3 a bargain purchase represents an economic gain which should be immediately recognized by the acquirer as income. However, the amount of bargain purchase gain was not taken to the statement of profit and loss account as the SBP, through its letter BPRD(R&PD)/2017/14330 dated June 13, 2017 recommended that the amount of gain may be routed directly into equity as a Non–distributable Capital Reserve (NCR). The NCR may become available for distribution through a stock dividend only with prior approval of the SBP. The Bank, before distribution of the gain as a stock dividend, may adjust any subsequent provisions/deficit, assessed by the Bank or recommended by the Banking Inspection Department of SBP, in the acquired assets and liabilities of NIB Bank Limited against the NCR.

24.2 Statutory reserve represents amount set aside as per the requirements of section 21 of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962.

# 40.14 Funding Policy

The Bank endeavours to ensure that liabilities under the various employee benefit schemes are covered by the Fund on any valuation date having regards to the various actuarial assumptions such as projected future salary increase, expected future contributions to the fund, projected increase in liability associated with future service and the projected investment income of the Fund.

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

# 40.15

The defined benefit plans may expose the bank to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, investment risk, salary increase risk and withdrawal rate risk as described below;

# Investment risk

The risk arises when the actual performance of the investments is lower than expectation and thus creating a shortfall in the funding objectives.

# Longevity risk

The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population.

# Salary increase risk

The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the benefit is linked with final salary. The risk arises when the actual increases are higher than expectation and impacts the liability accordingly.

# Withdrawal rate risk

The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

# 43. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as amortised cost / held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted debt securities classified as amortised cost / held to maturity are carried at cost. Fair value of unquoted equity investments other than investments in associates and subsidiaries is determined on the basis of break up value of these investments as per the latest available audited financial statements. Fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Bank’s accounting policy as stated in note 6.5 to these unconsolidated financial statements. The maturity and repricing profile and effective rates are stated in note 48. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and financial liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short–term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 43.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 2

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Federal Government securities|The fair values of Treasury Bills and fixed rate Pakistan Investments Bonds are determined using the PKRV rates while floating rate Pakistan Investments Bonds are revalued using PKFRV rates. The fair values of foreign currency denominated GoP Eurobonds are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg.|
|Term Finance Certificates and Bonds|Investments in debt securities (comprising term finance certificates, sukuks, bonds and any other security issued by a company or a body corporate for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.|
|Foreign Government Debt Securities|The fair values of Foreign Government debt securities are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg.|
|Foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
|Derivatives|The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currency involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration etc.|
|Unlisted Shares|Breakup value determined on the basis of NAV of the company using the latest available audited financial statements.|
|Mutual Funds|Units of mutual funds are valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).|
|Property and Equipment (land and building) & Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets.|

The table below analyses the financial and non–financial assets carried at fair values, by valuation methods. For financial assets, the Bank essentially carries its investments in debt and equity securities at fair values. Valuation of investments is carried out as per guidelines specified by the SBP. In case of non–financial assets, the Bank has adopted revaluation model (as per IAS 16) in respect of land and building & non–banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims.

The Bank is committed to conducting thorough due diligence to ensure that credit risks are properly analyzed, quantified, disclosed and managed. To manage adverse outcomes in terms of unfavorable scenarios, multiple control factors in the lending structure of the Bank provide additional comfort and support. Such controls range from quality of eligible collateral, pre–disbursement safety measures to post disbursement monitoring.

The Bank has a well–defined credit policy approved by the Board of Directors, which guides its lending activities. The credit evaluation system consists of robust credit appraisal, sanctioning, and review procedures to ensure prudence in lending and maintain a high–quality asset portfolio.

# 48.1.3.2 Collateral valuation and management

As stipulated in the SBP Basel guidelines, the Bank uses the comprehensive approach for collateral valuation. Under this approach, the Bank reduces its credit exposure to a counterparty when calculating its capital requirements to the extent of risk mitigation provided by the eligible financial collateral as specified in the Basel guidelines. In line with Basel guidelines, the Bank makes adjustments in eligible collaterals for possible future fluctuations in the value of the collateral. These adjustments, also referred to as ‘haircuts’, to produce volatility adjusted amounts for collateral, are reduced from the exposure to compute the capital charge based on the applicable risk weights.

---

## Chunk 863

# 48.1.3.3 Types of collaterals

The Bank describes the appropriate collateral for respective facility based on the category of product and counterparty. There are two types of collateral:

- Primary collateral comprises assets that are acquired / to be acquired through Bank ‘s financing i.e. hypothecation and pledge of stocks in case of Running Finance and Cash Finance facilities respectively.
- Secondary collateral is in addition to primary collateral and it serves the purpose of additional security. Generally, for short term financing facilities, tangible fixed assets i.e. immovable properties are required as secondary collateral.

# 48.2 Market Risk

Market Risk arises from changes in market rates such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads and/or commodity prices as well as their correlations and volatilities resulting in a loss to earnings and capital. The Bank is exposed to market risk primarily through its trading activities, which are centered in the Treasury and Foreign Exchange Group and the Capital Market Division. Market risk also arises from market–making, facilitation of client business and proprietary positions in equities, fixed income and interest rate products and foreign exchange, which exposes the Bank to interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and equity price risk.

The Bank’s Market Risk Management structure consists of Risk Management & Portfolio Review Committee (RM&PRC) of the Board, Management Credit and Risk Committee, ALCO and independent Market Risk Management Division reporting directly to Group Head Risk Management. Market Risk function works in close partnership with the business segments to identify and monitor market risks throughout the Bank and to define market risk policies and procedures. Market Risk seeks to facilitate efficient risk / return management decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance and provide transparency into the Bank’s market risk profile for senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators. Market risk authority, including both approval of market risk limits and approval of market risks is vested in the ALCO.

The Bank has clearly defined, in its Global Risk Management policy, the positions which shall be subject to trading book treatment. The definition covers the accounting classifications as well as positions booked by different business groups/functions under FVOCI category. The assets subject

to trading book treatment are frequently, mostly on daily basis, valued and actively managed. The positions which does not fulfill the criteria of trading book falls under the banking book and are treated as per regulatory requirements.

The Bank measures and manages Market Risk by using different risk parameters with combinations of various limits. The Board approved Risk Appetite and Global Risk Management Policy provide guidelines for assuming controlled market risk, its monitoring, reporting and management. The approved limits are compared with the numbers generated by the market risk management systems based on the trading activity and the outstanding positions.

Besides conventional methods, the Bank also uses VaR (Value at Risk) technique for market risk assessment of positions assumed by the bank. In–house developed solutions are used for calculating mark to market value of positions and generating VaR (value at risk) and sensitivity numbers. Thresholds for different positions are established to compare the expected losses at a given confidence level and over a specified time horizon. Interest rate risk is measured through the risk parameters viz. duration, Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP), and VaR on individual security basis as well as on portfolio basis. The result of these parameters are presented to the senior management for review on a daily basis.

A framework of stress testing, scenario analysis and reverse stress tests covering both banking and trading books as per SBP guidelines is also in place. The results of the stress tests are reviewed by senior management and also reported to the SBP.

# 48.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk exposes the bank to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than home currency due to the exchange rate fluctuation and volatility. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in foreign branches, foreign currency–denominated loans, foreign currency–denominated deposits, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, etc.

The core objective of foreign exchange risk management is to ensure the foreign exchange exposure of the Bank remains within defined risk appetite and insulate the Bank against undue losses that may arise due to volatile movements in foreign exchange rates or interest rates.

Limit structure to manage foreign exchange risk including gap limits on different tenors in major currencies is in place to control risk. Bank’s net open position and Foreign Exchange Exposure Limit (FEEL) are monitored and reported on intra–day and day end basis. Foreign exchange risk parameters including VaR is generated and monitored on daily basis. Stress testing of foreign exchange portfolio and its reporting to senior management and RM&PRC of the Board is a regular feature.

# 48.2.3 Equity position Risk

Bank’s proprietary positions in the equity instruments exposes it to the equity price risk in its trading and banking books. Equity price risk is managed by applying trading limits, scrip–wise and portfolio wise nominal limits. VaR analysis and stress testing of the equity portfolio are also performed and reported to senior management on a daily basis. The stress test for equity price risk assesses the impact of the fall in the stock market prices using certain assumptions. In addition to this stress testing, historical scenario analysis on equities is also performed periodically as advised by the State Bank of Pakistan through Guideline on Stress Testing.

# 48.2.4 Yield / Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)–Basel II Specific

Interest rate risk is the risk that fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in interest rates, including changes in the shape of yield curves. Interest rate risk is inherent in many of the Bank’s businesses and arises from mismatches between the contractual maturities or the re–pricing of on and off–balance sheet assets and liabilities. The interest rate sensitivity profile is prepared on a quarterly basis based on the re–pricing or contractual maturities of assets and liabilities. Interest rate risk is monitored and managed by performing periodic gap analysis, sensitivity analysis and stress testing and taking appropriate actions where required.

The increase / (decrease) in earnings due to change in the interest rate is as follows:

## Chunk 886

# Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. This definition includes legal risks but excludes strategic and reputational risks.

The Bank’s operational risk management framework, as laid down in the Global Risk Management Policy, duly approved by the Board, is flexible enough to implement in stages and permits the overall risk management approach to evolve in the light of organizational learning and the future needs of the Bank.

Operational loss events are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions taken on an ongoing basis, including measures to improve control procedures with respect to design and operative effectiveness.

Operational Risk Management helps the Bank understand risks and improve mitigating controls so as to minimize operational risks that are inherent in almost all areas of the Bank. Bank on continuous basis strengthens its risk function, policies and procedures to facilitate its operations and improve quality of assets to safeguard interest of depositors.

---

## Chunk 887

# Operational Risk–Disclosures Basel II Specific

Currently, the Bank is reporting operational risk capital charge under Basic Indicator Approach (BIA). The Bank have adopted a number of measures e.g. using Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), loss events database and Risk & Control Self Assessments (RCSA) to manage its operational risk effectively.

In accordance with the Operational Risk Management (OR) regulations, policy and framework, a database covering operational risk events is being maintained using a state of the art software solution, which has enhanced features and a better workflow management. This new software has further augmented bank’s capacity to capture and report operational risk events and KRIs. The software is also capable of generating periodical regulatory and management reports.

Periodical updates on Operational Risk events are presented to senior management and the Risk Management and Portfolio Review Committee of the Board.

## Chunk 888

# Liquidity Risk

Liquidity represents the ability to fund assets and meet obligations as they become due. The Bank understands that liquidity does not come for free, and surplus liquidity has an opportunity cost which needs to be recognized. Liquidity risk is a risk of not being able to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time period to meet obligations as they become due. Liquidity is essential to the ability to operate financial services businesses and, therefore, the ability to maintain adequate levels of liquidity through economic cycles is crucial.

Particularly during periods of adverse conditions, liquidity management is among the most important activities that the Bank conducts during both normal and stress periods. The Bank recognizes that liquidity risk can arise from the Bank’s activities and can be grouped into three categories:

---

## Chunk 889

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

– Inflows / Outflows from on–balance sheet items (other than marketable securities and wholesale borrowings) and off–balance sheet items;

– Marketability of trading securities; and

– Capacity to borrow from the wholesale markets for funding as well as trading activities.

## Chunk 890

# Liquidity Management

The Asset Liability Committee of the Bank has the responsibility for formulation of overall strategy and oversight of the Asset Liability Management function. The Board has approved a comprehensive Liquidity Risk Policy (part of Risk Management Policy), which stipulates policies regarding maintenance of various ratios, funding preferences, and evaluation of Banks’ liquidity under normal and stress scenarios. A framework to assess the maturity profile of non–contractual assets and liabilities is in place to supplement the liquidity management. Bank’s comprehensive liquidity management framework assists it to closely watch the liquidity position through monitoring of early warning indicators and stress testing, to ensure effective and timely decision making.

The Bank’s liquidity risk management framework is designed to identify measure and manage in a timely manner the liquidity risk position of the Bank. The underlying policies and procedures include: Global Risk Management policy, Global Treasury Policy, Investment policy, Contingency Funding Plan, Liquidity Strategy and Limit Structure which are reviewed and approved regularly by the senior management / Board. Moreover; the Bank also prepares a ‘Contingency Funding Plan’ (CFP) to address liquidity issues in time of stress/crises situation containing early warning indicators to preempt unforeseen liquidity crises.

The Bank conducts Liquidity Risk Analysis on regular basis as well as Maturity of gaps are also reviewed in order to ensure diversification in terms of tenors. MCB liquidity risk framework envisages to project the Bank’s funding position during temporary and long–term liquidity changes, including those caused by liability erosion and explicitly identifying quantifying and ranking all sources of funding preferences, such as reducing assets, modifying or increasing liability structure; and using other alternatives for controlling statement of financial position changes. The Bank performs regular liquidity stress tests as part of its liquidity monitoring activities. The purpose of the liquidity stress tests is intended to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Bank under both idiosyncratic and systemic market stress conditions. The Bank’s liquidity risk management approach involves intraday liquidity management, managing funding sources and evaluation of structural imbalances in balance sheet structure.

## Chunk 891

# Intraday Liquidity Management

Intraday liquidity management is about managing the daily payments and cash flows. The Bank has policies to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained during the day to make payments through local payment system. The policy of the Bank is to maintain adequate liquidity at all times, in all geographical locations and for all currencies and hence to be in a position, in the normal course of business, to meet obligations, repay depositors and fulfill commitments.

---

## Chunk 892

# Managing Funding Sources

As per policy, the Bank maintain a portfolio of marketable securities that can either be sold outright or sold through a repurchase agreement to generate cash flows for meeting unexpected liquidity requirement. As a part of liquidity management the Bank maintains borrowing relationships to ensure continued access to diverse market of funding sources. The Bank’s sound credit rating together with excellent market reputation has enabled the Bank to secure ample call lines with local and foreign banks. The level of liquidity reserves as per regulatory requirements also mitigates risks. The Bank’s investment in marketable securities is much higher than the Statutory Liquidity Requirements.

# Liquidity Gap Reporting

When an asset or liability does not have any contractual maturity date, the period in which these are assumed to mature has been taken as the expected date of maturity. The Bank regularly conducts an objective and systematic behavioral study using regression analysis technique to ascertain the maturity of its non-contractual assets and liabilities. Core and non-core parts of the non-contractual assets and liabilities are segregated through the behavioral study. Non Core part is placed among the short term maturity buckets i.e. up to 1 Year based on the model results, whereas core part is distributed among the longer terms buckets based on the discussion and decision by the ALCO. Following percentages are used to distribute the core assets and liabilities among longer term buckets:

# 48.5 Derivative Risk

Most business clients have either interest rate exposures arising from debt financing or currency exposures arising out of commercial transactions from import and export of goods. Businesses face the risk of sudden movements in interest rates or foreign exchange rates that may adversely affect their profitability. The Bank provides solutions to this problem through its derivatives desk in major types of derivative instruments i.e. forwards, futures, swaps and options. As an Authorized Derivative Dealer (ADD), the Bank is an active participant in Derivative market and has flexibility in providing a broad range of derivatives products covering both hedging and market making to satisfy customers’ needs. As an ADD, the Bank offers derivative products which are permitted under the Financial Derivative Business Regulations (FDBR) or as permitted by the State Bank of Pakistan. Before executing Derivative transactions, the Bank ensures that the clients understand the risk and reward associated with the derivative being offered. Derivative transactions are executed with appropriate clients only.

Risk management activities take place at the following different levels.

---

## Chunk 900

# Strategic Level:

By senior management, Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO), Management Credit and Risk Committee (MC&RC) and the Board of Directors to institute a risk management framework and to ensure provision of all resources and support required for effective risk management on Bank–wide basis. The Board provides the overall limits/thresholds for derivatives business.

# Macro Level:

By Treasury and FX Group and Risk Management Group, responsible for policy formulation, procedure development and implementation, monitoring and reporting.

## Chunk 901

# Micro Level:

Treasury Derivatives and Structured Product Desk where risks are actually created and Treasury Operations for settlements of the transactions.

Derivative Risk Management caters the following risks:–

Market Risk arises from changes in market rates such as Interest Rates, Foreign Exchange Rates, Equity Prices, credit spreads and/or commodity prices as well as their correlations and volatilities resulting in a loss to earnings and capital. In line with SBP’s regulatory guidelines, the Bank back–to–back hedges all option transactions with other financial institutions. The Bank minimizes the exchange rate risk on its Cross Currency Swap Portfolio by hedging the exposure in interbank market. The Bank also manages interest rate risk on its Interest Rate Derivatives and Cross Currency Swaps through various sensitivity limits approved by ALCO. Marked to market positions and sensitivity of the derivatives transactions are monitored on regular basis. All individual deals are approved at the appropriate level of authority after analyzing the risk and benefits associated with the deals.

Credit risk is a probable risk of loss resulting from customer’s inability to meet contractual obligation that may have adverse impact on Bank’s profitability. The Bank manages the risk by setting policies and limits for counterparty based on a pre–defined criteria linked with financial health of the customer. The exposure of each counterparty is monitored by Risk Management Function of the Bank on daily basis.

Considering small Derivative portfolio, the Bank is not exposed to any liquidity risk. However, the Bank manages liquidity risk through its liquidity risk framework which is defined in the relevant Liquidity Risk Section.

The Bank has adequate system and controls for smooth execution of derivative transactions. Transactions are executed in line with well defined accounting and operational aspects to mitigate the operational risk. Policies and control functions are regularly reviewed on periodic basis.

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

The Bank has adequate system and controls for smooth execution of derivative transactions. Transactions are executed in line with well defined accounting and operational aspects to mitigate the operational risk. Policies and control functions are regularly reviewed on periodic basis. The Bank uses a third party’s Super Derivative System which provides front end sales and structuring capabilities, end to end valuation solutions, risk management systems, back end processing and provides analytical tools to measure various risk exposures and carry out sensitivity analysis. The goal of asset/liability management (ALM) is to properly manage the risk related to changes in interest rates, the mix of balance sheet assets and liabilities, the holding of foreign currencies, and the use of derivatives. Due to thin liquidity in the derivative market, interest rate derivatives are not actively used to manage/alter the interest rate risk profile of the Bank.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

# To the members of MCB Bank Limited

# Opinion

We have audited the annexed consolidated financial statements of MCB Bank Limited and its subsidiary companies (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2024, and the consolidated statement of profit and loss account, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy information and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2024 and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan.

---

## Chunk 953

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Pakistan. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants as adopted by the Institute of the Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (the Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## Chunk 954

# Key Audit Matter(s)

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

## Chunk 955

# Following is the Key audit matter:

|S. No.|Key Audit Matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|Credit loss allowance against advances: (Refer notes 6.1.1.5, 6.1.1.6 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements)|Our audit procedures to verify credit loss allowance against advances included, amongst others, the following:|
| | |• We obtained and updated our understanding of the Group management’s assessment of credit loss allowance in respect of advances including the Group’s internal rating model, accounting policy and model methodology including any key changes made during the year.|
| | |• We obtained an understanding of the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the relevant controls established by the Group to identify loss events and for determining the extent of provisioning required against advances.|
| | |The testing of controls included testing of:|
| | |o controls over correct classification of advances;|
| | |o controls over monitoring of advances with higher risk of default and correct classification of non-performing advances on subjective criteria;|
| | |o controls over accurate computation and recording of provisions; and|
| | |o controls over the governance and approval process related to provisions, including continuous reassessment by the management.|

|---|---|---|
|1|The Group records charge for Stage 3 based on the higher of provision under Prudential Regulations or ECL under IFRS 9, as per the instructions of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). This assessment is conducted at the borrower / facility level for corporate, commercial, retail and consumer portfolios. If one facility of a counterparty becomes more than 90 days past due or is otherwise defined as impaired under Prudential Regulations, all other facilities of that counterparty are classified as Stage 3.|- We selected a sample of loan accounts and performed the following substantive procedures:
|

The net provision made / reversed during the year is charged to the consolidated statement of profit and loss account and accumulated provision is netted-off against advances. The Group has recognised a net credit loss allowance / provision against advances (including general provision) amounting to Rs. 5,312.327 million in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account in the current year. As at December 31, 2024, the Group holds a credit loss allowance / provision of Rs. 47,710.013 million against advances. In addition, the Group has also maintained a general reserve of Rs. 8,739.178 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 3,169.899 million) against advances / financing made in accordance with the prevailing circumstances as mentioned in note 6.1.1.5 to the consolidated financial statements.

The determination of credit loss allowance / provision against advances based on the above criteria remains a significant area of judgment and estimation. Because of the significance of the impact of these judgments / estimations and the materiality of advances relative to the overall consolidated financial statements of the Group, we considered this area as a key audit matter.

We issued instructions to auditors of those overseas branches which were selected for audit, highlighting ‘Credit loss allowance against advances’ as a significant risk. The auditors of those branches performed audit procedures to check compliance with regulatory requirements and reported the results thereof to us. We, as auditors of the Group, evaluated the work performed by the component auditors and the results thereof.

# Information Other than the Consolidated and Unconsolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Reports Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements and our auditor’s reports thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Annual Report 2024 433

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Chunk 958

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan and Companies Act, 2017 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

---

## Chunk 959

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.
- Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

434 Annual Report 2024

•  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Hammad Ali Ahmad.

# 3.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with the approved accounting standards requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experiences, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Critical accounting estimates and judgements applied in application of IFRS 9 have been disclosed under note 6.1. Other major areas where various assumptions and estimates are significant to the Group’s financial statements or where judgment was exercised in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

# a) Taxation

In making the estimates for income taxes currently payable by the Group, the management considers the current income tax laws and the decisions of appellate authorities on certain issues in the past.

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

# b) Fair value of derivatives

The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currency involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration etc.

---

## Chunk 977

# c) Depreciation, amortisation, impairment and revaluation of property and equipment

The management reviews the useful lives and residual values of assets annually by considering expected pattern of economic benefit that the management expects to derive from the item and the maximum period up to which such benefits are expected to be available. Any change in estimates in future years might affect the carrying amounts of the respective items of assets with a corresponding effect on the depreciation charge and impairment. Such change is accounted for as change in accounting estimates in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors”. Further, the Bank estimates the revalued amount of land and buildings on a regular basis. The estimates are based on valuations carried out by independent professional valuers under the market conditions.

## Chunk 978

# d) Staff retirement benefits

Certain actuarial assumptions have been adopted as disclosed in note 40 of these consolidated financial statements for the actuarial valuation of staff retirement benefit plans. Actuarial assumptions are entity’s best estimates of the variables that will determine the ultimate cost of providing post employment benefits. Changes in these assumptions in future years may affect the liability / asset under these plans in those years.

---

## Chunk 979

# e) Lease term for lease liability and right–of–use asset

The Group applies judgment to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right–of–use assets recognized.

---

## Chunk 980

# f) Provision and contingent assets and liabilities

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. Contingent assets are not recognized and are also not disclosed until an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognized and are disclosed unless the probability of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.

# 6.1 IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’

As per the SBP BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ is applicable on banks with effect from January 01, 2024. The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard also introduces a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on a forward looking ‘Expected Credit Losses’ (ECL) approach rather than the ‘incurred credit losses’ approach as previously followed. The ECL approach has an impact on all assets of the Group which are exposed to credit risk.

In preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group has applied requirements of IFRS 9 and SBP’s IFRS 9 Application Instructions issued through BPRD Circular No. 03 dated July 05, 2022 from the date of initial application of January 01, 2024 with a modified retrospective approach for restatement. As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group has not restated comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognized in the opening retained earnings and other reserves at the beginning of the current year without restating the comparative figures.

The SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 19, 2024, and BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 dated January 22, 2025 has made certain amendments and clarified the timelines of some of the SBP’s IFRS 9 Application Instructions to address the matters raised by the banks to ensure compliance by the timelines. The circulars have provided clarifications / relaxations on measurement of unquoted equity securities, modification accounting and maintenance of general provisions over and above ECL, accounting methodology form islamic banking institutions and treatment of charity. Accordingly, the Group has adopted the treatment as instructed in the aforementioned circulars in these consolidated financial statements.

On application of IFRS 9, certain accounting policies have been revised to comply with the requirements of IFRS 9. The revised accounting policies have been disclosed in their respective policy notes in these consolidated financial statements.

## Chunk 985

# 6.1.1 Application to the Group’s financial assets

# 6.1.1.1 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

Financial assets are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Group purchases or sells the asset. Other financial assets like advances, lending to financial institutions etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account or financial institutions. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased.

a. Amortised Cost (AC)

Financial assets under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An Expected Credit Loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in the statement of profit and loss account. Interest income / profit / expense on these assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the statement of profit and loss account.

# b. Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An Expected Credit Loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for debt based financial assets in the statement of profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of debt based financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the statement of profit and loss account and for equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is recognized directly in the statement of changes in equity.

---

## Chunk 987

# c. Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs will be directly recorded in the statement of profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in the statement of profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the statement of profit and loss account. An Expected Credit Loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

---

## Chunk 988

# 6.1.1.2 Classification and measurement

The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the business model within which they are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at Fair value through Profit or Loss (‘FVTPL’) regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Group’s business model in which financial assets are held determines whether the financial assets are measured at Amortised Cost (AC), fair value through Other Comprehensive Income (‘FVOCI’) or Fair Value through Profit or Loss (‘FVTPL’).

The business model reflects how groups of financial assets are managed to achieve a particular business objective. Debt based financial assets can only be held at amortised cost if these are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows (‘hold to collect’), and where those contractual cash flows are Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI). Assets may be sold out of ‘hold to collect’ portfolios where there is an increase in credit risk. Disposals for other reasons are permitted but such sales should be insignificant in value or infrequent in nature.

Debt based financial assets where the business model objectives are achieved by collecting the contractual cash flows and by selling the assets (‘hold to collect and sell’) and that have SPPI cash flows are measured at FVOCI, with unrealized gains or losses deferred in reserves until the asset is derecognized. The debt based financial assets that are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset at FVTPL that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI; if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

The classification of equity instruments is generally measured at FVTPL unless the Group, at initial recognition, irrevocably designates the investment as FVOCI in which case, both the unrealized and realized gains or losses are recognized in reserves and no amounts other than dividends received are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account.

All other financial assets will mandatorily be held at FVTPL. Financial assets may be designated at FVTPL only if doing so eliminates or reduces an accounting mismatch.

# Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

The requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Bank which are explained as follows:

---

## Chunk 989

# a. Debt based financial assets previously classified as Available for Sale (AFS)

The application of IFRS 9 has resulted in classification and consequent remeasurement of investments in Islamic Naya Pakistan Certificates (INPC’s), amounting to Rs. 5,699.494 million, held under AFS portfolio as of December 31, 2023 to FVTPL based on their business model assessment.

The failure of SPPI test upon assessment of contractual cash flows of debt based financial assets has resulted in classification and consequent remeasurement of investments in certain Non Government debt securities, amounting to Rs. 3,714.280 million, to FVTPL.

All other debt based financial assets previously classified as AFS upon passing the SPPI test have been designated as FVOCI under IFRS 9 as the Group’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, but also to sell those investment. There is no change to their measurement basis and recognition of realized and unrealized gain / loss under IFRS 9.

---

## Chunk 990

# b. Debt based financial assets previously classified as Held To Maturity (HTM)

Debt based financial assets currently classified as HTM upon passing the SPPI test have been designated as amortised cost under IFRS 9 as the Group’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows. Investments in certain non government debt securities, amounting to Rs. 7,506.816 million, on failing the SPPI test have been reclassified to FVTPL.

The following table reconciles the carrying value of investments in debt based financial assets as reported on December 31, 2023 to the carrying amounts on transition to IFRS 9 at January 01, 2024:

# c. Equity instruments previously classified as Available For Sale (AFS)

The Group has elected to irrevocably designate all quoted and unquoted equity securities previously classified as available for sale (AFS) as FVOCI except units of open end mutual funds, amounting to Rs. 115.980 million, that have been mandatorily classified as measured at FVTPL. The fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to statement of profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities.

IFRS 9 has eliminated impairment assessment requirements for investments in equity instruments. Accordingly, the Group has reclassified impairment of Rs. 9,783.874 million on listed equity investments and Rs. 205.765 million for unlisted equity investments held as at December 31, 2023 to surplus / deficit on revaluation of investments.

The measurement category and carrying amount of financial assets in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan before and after adoption of IFRS 9 as at January 01, 2024 are compared as follows:

# Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

# 6.1.1.4 Modification

The Group sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of financing to its customers. When the contractual cash flows of financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified and the renegotiation or modification does not result in derecognition of that financial asset in accordance with IFRS 9, the Group recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset and shall recognize a modification gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss account. The gross carrying amount of the financial asset is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate (or credit–adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit–impaired financial assets). Any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the financial asset.

---

## Chunk 993

# 6.1.1.5 Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Group assesses on a forward–looking basis the expected credit losses (‘ECL’) associated with all advances and other debt based financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, financial guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as “Financial Instruments”. The Group recognises a credit loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability–weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money; and
- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the Lifetime Expected Credit Loss (LTECL)), unless there has been no Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ Expected Credit Loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

---

## Chunk 994

# Staging criteria / Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR)

The Group has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Group uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Internal Credit Risk Rating (ICRR) or where principal and / or interest payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include restructuring, unavailability of financial information and pending litigations. ‘Based on the level of increase in credit risk, the Group shall calculate 12mECL for assets which did not have a SICR i.e., Stage 1 or a LTECL for the life of the asset (for assets which demonstrated a SICR) i.e., Stage 2.

Annual Report 2024 449

# Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

Based on the above process, the Group classifies its financial instruments into Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 as described below:

---

## Chunk 995

# Stage 1:

When financial instruments are first recognised, the Group recognises an allowance based on 12mECL. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Group calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to the Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected / forward looking Loss Given Default (LGD) and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

---

## Chunk 996

# Stage 2:

When a financial instrument has shown a Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) since origination, the Group records an allowance for the Lifetime Expected Credit Losses (LTECLs). Stage 2 also includes facilities where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but Probability of Defaults (PDs) are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

# Stage 3:

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Group recognises the LTECLs for these instruments. The Group uses a PD of 100% and the forward looking LGD as computed for each portfolio/segment.

The Group performs internal assessment and estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit contracts respectively. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of three scenarios. The ECLs related to guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within other liabilities.

# Portfolio Segmentation

For assessment of significant deterioration in credit risk and estimation of corresponding risk parameters, financial instruments have been grouped together based on their shared risk characteristics to collectively assess for significant credit risk deterioration.

# ECL Measurement Models

# – Probability of Default (PD):

The Probability of default (PD) represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation, either over the next 12 months, or over the remaining lifetime (Lifetime PD) of the obligation.

For loans and advances, PD estimation is based on the historic transitions of segmented obligors from one credit state/rating to another credit state/rating. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Group’s internal credit risk ratings (i.e. from ICRR 1 to ICRR 12). In order to convert historic trends to forward-looking; PDs are weighted by considering key macro-economic drivers affecting credit ratings i.e. (Gross Domestic Product, Consumer Price Index, Volume of Export of Goods, Unemployment).

For other financial assets (i.e. investments, lending to financial institutions, balances with other banks etc.), historical PDs have been estimated on the basis of global default rates taken from S&P rating-wise transition matrices. These annual default rates have then been converted into forward-looking point in time PDs using the Vasicek model.

# – Exposure at Default (EAD):

Exposure at Default (EAD) represents the amount of potential exposure that is at risk. The estimation of EAD considers any expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including expected drawdowns on committed facilities through the application of a Credit Conversion Factor (CCF). The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Group has a legal right to call it earlier. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Group does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the Group’s expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the Group’s future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

---

## Chunk 1000

# – Loss Given Default (LGD):

LGD represents an estimate of the loss incurred on a facility in the event of default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Group expects to receive. It is expressed as a percentage of the EAD. The LGDs are determined using workout approach, based on vintage recovery data for the defaulted portfolio; these recoveries are then discounted back to date of default, to factor in time value of money. The Group has converted the estimates for segment / product wise historical LGDs (Through the cycle LGDs) into forward looking point in time LGDs using the Jacob Frye model; that estimates LGD as an increasing function of default rate.

---

## Chunk 1001

# The calculation of ECLs

The ECL is determined by projecting the PD, LGD and EAD for each future repayment date and for each individual exposure. These three components are multiplied together, effectively calculating an ECL for each future repayment date, which is then discounted back to the reporting date and summed. The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities; effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level. When estimating the ECLs, in addition to the base economic scenario, the Group considers three scenarios (a base case, an upside, a downside). Each of these is associated with different PDs. The number of scenarios and their attributes are reassessed at each reporting date. The scenario weightings are determined by a combination of statistical analysis and expert credit judgment, taking account of the range of possible outcomes each chosen scenario is representative of.

The Group’s management has only considered cash, liquid securities, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals, while calculating EADs. The credit exposure (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

# General provisions over and above the ECL

ECL calculation under IFRS 9 involves evaluation against multiple qualitative and quantitative parameters, including forward looking estimates, and hence demands a considerable amount of subjectivity. Considering the volatility in current operating and macroeconomic environment, the sensitivity in ECL models could lead to significant variations in the ECL charge reported for comparative periods. In order to overcome this volatility, the Group has set a minimum threshold for ECL recognition against advances and non–funded exposure classified in Stage 1 and Stage 2. SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 dated January 22, 2025 has permitted banks to maintain general provisions, over and above the ECL worked out for Stage 1 and Stage 2, upto December 31, 2026.

## Chunk 1003

# For Advances:

# Stage 1:

ECL allowance has been recognized based on IFRS 9 principles. In case, IFRS 9 provision is less than 1% of gross advances classified under Stage 1, the Holding Company maintains a general reserve over and above the IFRS 9 based ECL. The general reserve is being maintained as the difference between 1% of gross advances classified under Stage 1 and ECL computed under IFRS 9 principles.

---

## Chunk 1004

# Stage 2:

ECL allowance has been recognized based on IFRS 9 principles. In case, IFRS 9 provision is less than 5% of gross advances classified under Stage 2, the Holding Company maintains a general reserve over and above the IFRS 9 based ECL. The general reserve is being maintained as the difference between 5% of gross advances classified under Stage 2 and ECL computed under IFRS 9 principles.

## Chunk 1005

# For Non–Funded Credit Exposure:

# Stage 1:

ECL allowance has been recognized based on IFRS 9 principles. In case, IFRS 9 provision is less than 0.20% of non–funded exposure classified under Stage 1, the Holding Company maintains a general reserve over and above the IFRS 9 based ECL. The general reserve is being maintained as the difference between 0.20% of non–funded exposure classified under Stage 1 and ECL computed under IFRS 9 principles.

## Chunk 1006

# Stage 2:

ECL allowance has been recognized based on IFRS 9 principles. In case, IFRS 9 provision is less than 0.50% of non–funded exposure classified under Stage 1, the Holding Company maintains a general reserve over and above the IFRS 9 based ECL. The general reserve is being maintained as the difference between 0.50% of non–funded exposure classified under Stage 2 and ECL computed under IFRS 9 principles.

## Chunk 1007

# Backward Transition

In line with Group’s IFRS 9 Policy and Regulatory guidelines, financial assets shall be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they fulfill the criteria outlined in the Prudential Regulations (PR) issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Similarly, financial assets classified under Stage 2 shall be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer exist. However, a minimum period of three months, as approved by the Board of Directors, from the initial downgrade is mandatory before any facility can be moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2.

For a facility to transition from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it must meet the declassification requirements specified in the relevant Prudential Regulations. An exposure cannot be directly upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1; instead, it must first transition to Stage 2 and subsequently complete a cooling–off period of three months before being reclassified to Stage 1.

# Impact on Regulatory Capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the Banks, which has affected their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL provisioning, a transitional arrangement is allowed to the banks to absorb impact on regulatory capital; in accordance with SBP’s Guideline for absorption of ECL for CAR Purposes as mentioned in Annexure C of BPRD Circular No 3 of 2022. However, the Group has not availed benefit of captioned transitional arrangement in regulatory capital.

## Chunk 1009

# 6.1.1.6 Definition of default

The concept of ‘impairment or default’ is critical to the implementation of IFRS 9 as it drives determination of risk parameters, i.e. PD, LGD and EAD. The Group has defined that an exposure with regards to a particular obligor will be treated as having defaulted when either one or both of the following two events have taken place:

- If a customer fails to service mark–up and / or principal within Days Past Due (DPD) criteria as prescribed by SBP from time to time;
- The Group considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realizing security (if held).

# 6.1.1.7 Write–offs

The Group’s accounting policy under IFRS 9 remains the same as it was under SBP regulations / existing reporting framework.

---

## Chunk 1010

# 6.1.2 Application to the Group’s financial liabilities

The accounting for financial liabilities remain largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus financial liabilities are being carried at amortised cost except for derivatives that has been measured at fair value. The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non–cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the statement of profit and loss account.

## Chunk 1011

# 6.1.3 Adoption Impacts

The Group has adopted IFRS 9 effective from January 01, 2024 with modified retrospective approach as permitted under IFRS 9. The cumulative impact of initial application of Rs. 5,230.900 million has been recorded as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of the current accounting period. The details of the impacts of initial application are tabulated below:

# 6.2 IFRS 16 – Lease Liability & Right–of–Use Assets

The Group enters into leasing arrangements of buildings for its branches and offices. Rental contracts are typically for a fixed period and may have extension options. At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease based on whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The carrying amount is remeasured / adjusted if there are changes in the future cash flows or the lease term.

The right–of–use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date. On subsequent measurement, right–of–use assets are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation / accumulated impairment losses and are adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.

Right–of–use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term as this method closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits. Carrying amount of the lease liability is derecognized upon termination of the lease contract with corresponding adjustment to right–of–use asset. Gain or loss on termination of lease contract is recognized in the statement of profit and loss account.

The Group has elected not to recognize a right–of–use asset and the corresponding lease liability for short–term leases with terms of 12 months or less and leases of low–value assets. Payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense in the statement of profit or loss account on a straight–line basis.

When there is a change in scope of a lease, or the consideration for a lease, that was not part of the original terms and conditions of the lease is accounted for as a lease modification. The lease modification is accounted for as a separate lease if modification increases the scope of lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets and the consideration for lease increases by an amount that is commensurate with the stand–alone price for the increase in scope adjusted to reflect the circumstances of the particular contracts, if any. When the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, the lease liability is remeasured and corresponding adjustment is made to right–of–use asset.

# 6.3 Investments

Investments include Federal Government securities, shares, mutual fund units, non–Government debt securities, foreign securities, associates. Classification and measurement of investments has been detailed in note 6.1.

## Chunk 1016

# 6.3.1 Investments in Associates

Investment in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, after initially being recognised at cost. Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post–acquisition profits or losses of the investee in the consolidated profit or loss, and the Group’s share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.

Securities sold subject to a repurchase agreement (repo) are retained in these consolidated financial statements as investments and the counter party liability is included in borrowings, unless the securities qualify for derecognition upon transfer of substantial risks and rewards associated with the securities to the counter party. Securities purchased under an agreement to resell (reverse repo) are not recognized in these consolidated financial statements as investments and the amount extended to the counter party is included in lending’s to financial institutions. The difference between the purchase / sale and re–sale / re–purchase price is recognized as mark–up income / expense on a time proportion basis, as the case may be.

## Chunk 1018

# 6.5 Loans and advances

Loans and advances including net investment in finance lease are stated net of credit loss allowance and general reserve / provision. Credit loss allowance against loans and advances have been made in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations, IFRS 9 application instructions and various circulars issued by the SBP from time to time. The Group also maintains a general reserve against loans and advances, over and above the IFRS 9 based ECL, as permitted by SBP under BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 dated January 22, 2025.

Staff loans and subsidised loans disbursed under Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) have been recorded at fair value resulting in recognition of fair value adjustment on initial recognition. Unwinding of income on fair value adjustment is recognised in the statement of profit and loss account. Leases where the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. A receivable is recognized at an amount equal to the present value of the lease payments including any guaranteed residual value. Finance lease receivables are included in advances to the customers.

Advances are written off / charged off when there are no realistic prospects of recovery or to clean up the balance sheet as allowed by the SBP. In Murabaha transactions, the Group purchases the goods through its agent or client and after taking the possession, sells them to the customer on cost plus profit basis either in a spot or credit transaction. Under Murabaha financing, funds disbursed for purchase of goods are recorded as ‘Advance against Murabaha finance’. On culmination of Murabaha i.e. sale of goods to customers, Murabaha financing are recorded at the deferred sale price. Goods purchased but remaining unsold at the statement of financial position date are recorded as inventories.

The Group values its inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost necessary to make the sale. Cost of inventories represents actual purchases made by the Group / customers as the agent of the Group for subsequent sale.

In Ijarah financing, the Group provides the asset on pre–agreed rentals for specific tenors to the customers. Ijarah assets are stated at cost less depreciation and are disclosed as part of ‘Islamic financing and related assets’. The rental on Ijarah under Islamic Financial Accounting Standard – 2 Ijarah (IFAS 2) are recorded as income / revenue. The Group charges depreciation from the date of recognition of Ijarah of respective assets to Mustajir. Ijarah assets are depreciated over the period of Ijarah using the straight line method. Impairment of Ijarah assets is determined in accordance with the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP.

In Diminishing Musharaka based financing, the Group enters into Musharaka based on Shirkat–ul–Milk for financing and agreed share of fixed assets (example: house, land, plant, machinery or vehicle) with its customers and enters into period profit payment agreement for the utilization of the Group’s Musharaka share by the customer.

# 6.6 Property and equipment and depreciation

Property and equipment other than land and buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Buildings are carried at revalued amount less any accumulated depreciation and subsequent impairment losses, if any. Land is carried at revalued amount less any subsequent impairment losses, if any. Cost of property and equipment of foreign operations includes exchange differences arising on currency translation at year–end rates.

Capital work–in–progress is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. These are transferred to specific assets as and when assets become available for use.

Depreciation on all property and equipment (excluding land) is charged using the straight line method in accordance with the rates specified in note 12.2 to these consolidated financial statements and after taking into account residual value, if any. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.

Depreciation on additions is charged from the month the assets are available for use while no depreciation is charged in the month in which the assets are disposed off.

Land and buildings are revalued by independent, professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. An increase arising on revaluation is credited to the surplus on revaluation of property and equipment account. A decrease arising on revaluation of property and equipment is adjusted against the surplus of that asset or, if no surplus exists, is charged to the statement of profit and loss account as an impairment of the asset. A surplus arising subsequently on an impaired asset is reversed through the statement of profit and loss account up to the extent of the original impairment.

Surplus on revaluation of property and equipment (net of associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit.

Gains / losses on sale of property and equipment are credited / charged to the statement of profit and loss account currently, except that the related surplus on revaluation of land and buildings (net of deferred taxation) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or are recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of profit and loss account.

## Chunk 1021

# 6.7 Intangible assets

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets are amortized from the month when these assets are available for use, using the straight line method, whereby the cost of the intangible assets are amortized over its estimated useful lives over which economic benefits are expected to flow to the Group. The useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.

The carrying amount of assets are reviewed at each reporting date for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable.
If such indication exists and where the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount,
assets are written down to their recoverable amounts. The resulting impairment loss is taken to the
statement of profit and loss account except for impairment loss on revalued assets, which is adjusted
against the related revaluation surplus to the extent that the impairment loss does not exceed the
surplus on revaluation of that asset.

24.1 Under IFRS–3 a bargain purchase represents an economic gain which should be immediately recognized by the acquirer as income. However, the amount of bargain purchase gain was not taken to the statement of profit and loss account as the SBP, through its letter BPRD(R&PD)/2017/14330 dated June 13, 2017 recommended that the amount of gain may be routed directly into equity as a Non–distributable Capital Reserve (NCR). The NCR may become available for distribution through a stock dividend only with prior approval of the SBP. The Holding company, before distribution of the gain as a stock dividend, may adjust any subsequent provisions/deficit, assessed by the Holding company or recommended by the Banking Inspection Department of SBP, in the acquired assets and liabilities of NIB Bank Limited against the NCR.

24.2 Statutory reserve represents amount set aside as per the requirements of section 21 of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962.

The Holding Company endeavours to ensure that liabilities under the various employee benefit schemes are covered by the Fund on any valuation date having regards to the various actuarial assumptions such as projected future salary increase, expected future contributions to the fund, projected increase in liability associated with future service and the projected investment income of the Fund.

## Chunk 1144

# 40.15 The defined benefit plans may expose the Holding Company to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, investment risk, salary increase risk and withdrawal rate risk as described below;

Investment risk: The risk arises when the actual performance of the investments is lower than expectation and thus creating a shortfall in the funding objectives.

Longevity risk: The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population.

Salary increase risk: The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the benefit is linked with final salary. The risk arises when the actual increases are higher than expectation and impacts the liability accordingly.

Withdrawal rate risk: The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

# 43. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as amortised cost / held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted debt securities classified as amortised cost / held to maturity are carried at cost. Fair value of unquoted equity investments other than investments in associates is determined on the basis of break up value of these investments as per the latest available audited financial statements. Fair value of fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy as stated in note 6.5 to these consolidated financial statements. The maturity and repricing profile and effective rates are stated in note 48. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and financial liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short–term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

## Chunk 1154

# 43.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 2

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Federal Government Securities|The fair values of Treasury Bills and fixed rate Pakistan Investments Bonds are determined using the PKRV rates while floating rate Pakistan Investments Bonds are revalued using PKFRV rates. The fair values of foreign currency denominated GoP Eurobonds are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg.|
|Term Finance Certificates, Sukuks and Bonds|Investments in debt securities (comprising term finance certificates, sukuks, bonds and any other security issued by a company or a body corporate for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.|
|Foreign Government Debt Securities|The fair values of Foreign Government debt securities are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg.|
|Foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
|Derivatives|The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currency involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration etc.|
|Unlisted Shares|Breakup value determined on the basis of NAV of the company using the latest available audited financial statements.|
|Mutual Funds|Units of mutual funds are valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).|
|Property and Equipment (land and building) & Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets.|

The table below analyses the financial and non–financial assets carried at fair values, by valuation methods. For financial assets, the Group essentially carries its investments in debt and equity securities at fair values. Valuation of investments is carried out as per guidelines specified by the SBP. In case of non–financial assets, the Group has adopted revaluation model (as per IAS 16) in respect of land and building & non–banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims.

Credit Risk Monitoring is based on a comprehensive reporting framework. Continuous monitoring of the credit portfolio and the risks attached thereto are carried out at different levels including businesses, Audit & Risk Assets Review, Credit Risk Control, Credit Risk Management Division etc. To ensure a prudent distribution of asset portfolio, the Group manages its lending and investment activities within an appropriate limits framework to manage concentrations in terms of risk quality, industry and large exposure. Per party exposure limit is maintained in accordance with SBP Prudential Regulations.

An internal credit rating system is in place, which is capable of quantifying counter–party risk. The risk rating system incorporates comprehensive obligor risk rating models for the Corporate, Commercial, Small & Medium Enterprises and Agricultural portfolios. These models are designed using a diverse array of qualitative and quantitative variables, each assigned specific weights or scores. The aggregate score of these variables is mapped to determine the final obligor risk rating. These models are regularly validated and updated to maintain their predictive accuracy. Credit loss allowance against loans and advances have been made in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations, IFRS 9 application instructions and various circulars issued by the SBP from time to time. The Group also maintains a general reserve against loans and advances, over and above the IFRS 9 based ECL, as permitted by SBP under BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 dated January 22, 2025.

# 48.1.3.2 Collateral valuation and management

As stipulated in the SBP Basel guidelines, the Group uses the comprehensive approach for collateral valuation. Under this approach, the Group reduces its credit exposure to a counterparty when calculating its capital requirements to the extent of risk mitigation provided by the eligible financial collateral as specified in the Basel guidelines. In line with Basel guidelines, the Group makes adjustments in eligible collaterals for possible future fluctuations in the value of the collateral. These adjustments, also referred to as ‘haircuts’, to produce volatility adjusted amounts for collateral, are reduced from the exposure to compute the capital charge based on the applicable risk weights.

---

## Chunk 1183

# 48.1.3.3 Types of collaterals

The Group describes the appropriate collateral for respective facility based on the category of product and counterparty. There are two types of collateral:

# 48.2 Market Risk

Market Risk arises from changes in market rates such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads and/or commodity prices as well as their correlations and volatilities resulting in a loss to earnings and capital. The Group is exposed to market risk primarily through its trading activities, which are centered in the Treasury and Foreign Exchange Group and the Capital Market Division. Market risk also arises from market–making, facilitation of client business and proprietary positions in equities, fixed income and interest rate products and foreign exchange, which exposes the Bank to interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and equity price risk.

The Group’s Market Risk Management structure consists of Risk Management & Portfolio Review Committee (RM&PRC) of the Board, Management Credit and Risk Committee, ALCO and independent Market Risk Management Division reporting directly to Group Head Risk Management. Market Risk function works in close partnership with the business segments to identify and monitor market risks throughout the Group and to define market risk policies and procedures. Market Risk seeks to facilitate efficient risk / return management decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance and provide transparency into the Bank’s market risk profile for senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators. Market risk authority, including both approval of market risk limits and approval of market risks is vested in the ALCO.

The Group has clearly defined, in its Global Risk Management policy, the positions which shall be subject to trading book treatment. The definition covers the accounting classifications as well as positions booked by different business groups/functions under FVOCI category. The assets subject

to trading book treatment are frequently, mostly on daily basis, valued and actively managed. The positions which does not fulfill the criteria of trading book falls under the banking book and are treated as per regulatory requirements.

The Group measures and manages Market Risk by using different risk parameters with combinations of various limits. The Board approved Risk Appetite and Global Risk Management Policy provide guidelines for assuming controlled market risk, its monitoring, reporting and management. The approved limits are compared with the numbers generated by the market risk management systems based on the trading activity and the outstanding positions.

Besides conventional methods, the Bank also uses VaR (Value at Risk) technique for market risk assessment of positions assumed by the bank. In–house developed solutions are used for calculating mark to market value of positions and generating VaR (value at risk) and sensitivity numbers. Thresholds for different positions are established to compare the expected losses at a given confidence level and over a specified time horizon. Interest rate risk is measured through the risk parameters viz. Duration, Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP), and VaR on individual security basis as well as on portfolio basis. The result of these parameters are presented to the senior management for review on a daily basis.

A framework of stress testing, scenario analysis and reverse stress tests covering both banking and trading books as per SBP guidelines is also in place. The results of the stress tests are reviewed by senior management and also reported to the SBP.

# 48.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk exposes the Group to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than home currency due to the exchange rate fluctuation and volatility. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in foreign branches, foreign currency–denominated loans, foreign currency–denominated deposits, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, etc.

The core objective of foreign exchange risk management is to ensure the foreign exchange exposure of the Group remains within defined risk appetite and insulate the Group against undue losses that may arise due to volatile movements in foreign exchange rates or interest rates.

Limit structure to manage foreign exchange risk including gap limits on different tenors in major currencies is in place to control risk. Group’s net open position and Foreign Exchange Exposure Limit (FEEL) are monitored and reported on intra–day and day end basis. Foreign exchange risk parameters including VaR is generated and monitored on daily basis. Stress testing of foreign exchange portfolio and its reporting to senior management and RM&PRC of the Board is a regular feature.

# 48.2.3 Equity position Risk

Group’s proprietary positions in the equity instruments exposes it to the equity price risk in its trading and banking books. Equity price risk is managed by applying trading limits, scrip–wise and portfolio wise nominal limits. VaR analysis and stress testing of the equity portfolio are also performed and reported to senior management on a daily basis. The stress test for equity price risk assesses the impact of the fall in the stock market prices using certain assumptions. In addition to this stress testing, historical scenario analysis on equities is also performed periodically as advised by the State Bank of Pakistan through Guideline on Stress Testing.

# 48.2.4 Yield / Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)–Basel II Specific

Interest rate risk is the risk that fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in interest rates, including changes in the shape of yield curves. Interest rate risk is inherent in many of the Group’s businesses and arises from mismatches between the contractual maturities or the re–pricing of on and off–balance sheet assets and liabilities. The interest rate sensitivity profile is prepared on a quarterly basis based on the re–pricing or contractual maturities of assets and liabilities. Interest rate risk is monitored and managed by performing periodic gap analysis, sensitivity analysis and stress testing and taking appropriate actions where required.

# The increase / (decrease) in earnings due to change in the interest rate is as follows:

# Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. This definition includes legal risks but excludes strategic and reputational risks.

The Group’s operational risk management framework, as laid down in the Global Risk Management Policy, duly approved by the Board, is flexible enough to implement in stages and permits the overall risk management approach to evolve in the light of organizational learning and the future needs of the Group.

Operational loss events are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions taken on an ongoing basis, including measures to improve control procedures with respect to design and operative effectiveness.

Operational Risk Management helps the Group understand risks and improve mitigating controls so as to minimize operational risks that are inherent in almost all areas of the Group. Group on continuous basis strengthens its risk function, policies and procedures to facilitate its operations and improve quality of assets to safeguard interest of depositors.

# Liquidity Risk

Liquidity represents the ability to fund assets and meet obligations as they become due. The Group understands that liquidity does not come for free, and surplus liquidity has an opportunity cost which needs to be recognized. Liquidity risk is a risk of not being able to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time period to meet obligations as they become due. Liquidity is essential to the ability to operate financial services businesses and, therefore, the ability to maintain surplus levels of liquidity through economic cycles is crucial. Particularly during periods of adverse conditions, liquidity management is among the most important activities that the Group conducts during both normal and stress periods. The Group recognizes that liquidity risk can arise from the Group’s activities and can be grouped into three categories:

## Chunk 1208

# Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

– Inflows/Outflows from on–balance sheet items (other than marketable securities and wholesale borrowings) and off–balance sheet items;

– Marketability of trading securities; and

– Capacity to borrow from the wholesale markets for funding as well as trading activities.

## Chunk 1209

# Liquidity Management

The Asset Liability Committee of the Bank has the responsibility for formulation of overall strategy and oversight of the Asset Liability Management function. The Board has approved a comprehensive Liquidity Risk Policy (part of Risk Management Policy), which stipulates policies regarding maintenance of various ratios, funding preferences, and evaluation of Groups’ liquidity under normal and stress scenarios. A framework to assess the maturity profile of non–contractual assets and liabilities is in place to supplement the liquidity management. Group’s comprehensive liquidity management framework assists it to closely watch the liquidity position through monitoring of early warning indicators and stress testing, to ensure effective and timely decision making.

The Group’s liquidity risk management framework is designed to identify measure and manage in a timely manner the liquidity risk position of the Bank. The underlying policies and procedures include: Global Risk Management policy, Global Treasury Policy, Investment policy, Contingency Funding Plan, Liquidity Strategy and Limit Structure which are reviewed and approved regularly by the senior management / Board. Moreover; the Group also prepares a ‘Contingency Funding Plan’ (CFP) to address liquidity issues in time of stress/crises situation containing early warning indicators to preempt unforeseen liquidity crises. The Group conducts Liquidity Risk Analysis on regular basis as well as Maturity of gaps are also reviewed in order to ensure diversification in terms of tenors. MCB liquidity risk framework envisages to project the Bank’s funding position during temporary and long–term liquidity changes, including those caused by liability erosion and explicitly identifying quantifying and ranking all sources of funding preferences, such as reducing assets, modifying or increasing liability structure; and using other alternatives for controlling statement of financial position changes. The Bank performs regular liquidity stress tests as part of its liquidity monitoring activities. The purpose of the liquidity stress tests is intended to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Bank under both idiosyncratic and systemic market stress conditions. The Group’s liquidity risk management approach involves intraday liquidity management, managing funding sources and evaluation of structural imbalances in balance sheet structure.

# Intraday Liquidity Management

Intraday liquidity management is about managing the daily payments and cash flows. The Group has policies to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained during the day to make payments through local payment system. The policy of the Group is to maintain adequate liquidity at all times, in all geographical locations and for all currencies and hence to be in a position, in the normal course of business, to meet obligations, repay depositors and fulfill commitments.

---

## Chunk 1211

# Managing Funding Sources

As per policy, the Group maintain a portfolio of marketable securities that can either be sold outright or sold through a repurchase agreement to generate cash flows for meeting unexpected liquidity requirement. As a part of liquidity management the Bank maintains borrowing relationships to ensure continued access to diverse market of funding sources. The Group’s sound credit rating together with excellent market reputation has enabled the Bank to secure ample call lines with local and foreign banks. The level of liquidity reserves as per regulatory requirements also mitigates risks. The Bank’s investment in marketable securities is much higher than the Statutory Liquidity Requirements.

# Liquidity Gap Reporting

When an asset or liability does not have any contractual maturity date, the period in which these are assumed to mature has been taken as the expected date of maturity. The Group regularly conducts an objective and systematic behavioral study using regression analysis technique to ascertain the maturity of its non–contractual assets and liabilities. Core and non–core parts of the non–contractual assets and liabilities are segregated through the behavioral study. Non Core part is placed among the short term maturity buckets i.e. up to 1 Year based on the model results, whereas core part is distributed among the longer terms buckets based on the discussion and decision by the ALCO. Following percentages are used to distribute the core assets and liabilities among longer term buckets:

# Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements

# 48.5 Derivative Risk

Most business clients have either interest rate exposures arising from debt financing or currency exposures arising out of commercial transactions from import and export of goods. Businesses face the risk of sudden movements in interest rates or foreign exchange rates that may adversely affect their profitability. The Group provides solutions to this problem through its derivatives desk in major types of derivative instruments i.e. forwards, futures, swaps and options. As an Authorized Derivative Dealer (ADD), the Group is an active participant in Derivative market and has flexibility in providing a broad range of derivatives products covering both hedging and market making to satisfy customers’ needs. As an ADD, the Group offers derivative products which are permitted under the Financial Derivative Business Regulations (FDBR) or as permitted by the State Bank of Pakistan. Before executing Derivative transactions, the Group ensures that the clients understand the risk and reward associated with the derivative being offered. Derivative transactions are executed with appropriate clients only.

Risk management activities take place at the following different levels.

## Chunk 1220

# Strategic Level:

By senior management, Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO), Management Credit and Risk Committee (MC&RC) and the Board of Directors to institute a risk management framework and to ensure provision of all resources and support required for effective risk management on Bank–wide basis. The Board provides the overall limits/thresholds for derivatives business.

# Macro Level:

## Chunk 1221

# Market Risk

Market Risk arises from changes in market rates such as Interest Rates, Foreign Exchange Rates, Equity Prices, credit spreads and/or commodity prices as well as their correlations and volatilities resulting in a loss to earnings and capital. In line with SBP’s regulatory guidelines, the Bank back–to–back hedges all option transactions with other financial institutions. The Bank minimizes the exchange rate risk on its Cross Currency Swap Portfolio by hedging the exposure in interbank market. The Bank also manages interest rate risk on its Interest Rate Derivatives and Cross Currency Swaps through various sensitivity limits approved by ALCO. Marked to market positions and sensitivity of the derivatives transactions are monitored on regular basis. All individual deals are approved at the appropriate level of authority after analyzing the risk and benefits associated with the deals.

## Chunk 1222

# Credit Risk

Credit risk is a probable risk of loss resulting from customer’s inability to meet contractual obligation that may have adverse impact on Bank’s profitability. The Bank manages the risk by setting policies and limits for counterparty based on a pre–defined criteria linked with financial health of the customer. The exposure of each counterparty is monitored by Risk Management Function of the Group on daily basis.

Considering small Derivative portfolio, the Bank is not exposed to any liquidity risk. However, the Bank manages liquidity risk through its liquidity risk framework which is defined in the relevant Liquidity Risk Section.

The Group has adequate system and controls for smooth execution of derivative transactions. Transactions are executed in line with well defined accounting and operational aspects to mitigate the operational risk. Policies and control functions are regularly reviewed on periodic basis.

# Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2024

The Group uses a third party’s Super Derivative System which provides front end sales and structuring capabilities, end to end valuation solutions, risk management systems, back end processing and provides analytical tools to measure various risk exposures and carry out sensitivity analysis. The goal of asset/liability management (ALM) is to properly manage the risk related to changes in interest rates, the mix of balance sheet assets and liabilities, the holding of foreign currencies, and the use of derivatives. Due to thin liquidity in the derivative market, interest rate derivatives are not actively used to manage/alter the interest rate risk profile of the Group.
