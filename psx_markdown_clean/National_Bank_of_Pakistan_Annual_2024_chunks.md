# 75 YEARS OF SERVICE FOR THE NATION

Following Pakistan’s independence in 1947, the nation inherited a fragile financial system, necessitating the establishment of a commercial bank with a truly national vision.

This commitment has persisted throughout the Bank’s history, remaining steadfast through both challenging and dynamic times. With a workforce of over 15,000 full-time employees, the Bank’s expansive network, comprising both domestic and international branches, agency arrangements, and business promotion offices across Europe, America, Central Asia, and the Middle and Far East, reflects its global reach.

# CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW

Dear Shareholders,

It is a privilege for me to present my third Annual Review on the Board’s effectiveness in guiding the Bank towards its strategic objectives. The Board remains steadfast in upholding strong governance principles, ensuring that the Bank stays on course to fulfil its Vision of enabling sustainable growth and the all important inclusive development of all its stakeholders.

The Board continues to prioritize the best interests of the Bank’s shareholders through various Board Committees, each with clearly defined mandates. These Committees play a crucial role in overseeing key areas of governance, risk management and strategic decision-making, ensuring the Bank’s long term stability and sustainable growth.

The year 2024 has been a defining chapter in National Bank of Pakistan’s history wherein:

- Pursuant to the Honourable Supreme Court ruling on the long-standing pensions case, the Bank had to absorb an unprecedented cost of PKR 68 billion. This has been an extraordinary challenge that would have tested the financial strength of any institution. In the face of this challenge, we have achieved remarkable financial stability which is a testament to the prudent governance, strong risk management and strategic foresight of the Board. Our ability to withstand such an impact while still delivering value, ensuring sustainable returns and resuming dividend payments after seven years speaks volumes about NBP’s financial resilience and long-term sustainability.
- After a gap of several years, we are pleased to announce the resumption of dividend payment to our shareholders (subject to approvals required under the law). This milestone is a reflection of our strengthened financial position and unwavering commitment of the Board and management towards creating sustainable value for our shareholders.
- Amidst an evolving financial landscape, we have delivered a robust performance, staying true to our strategic vision and reinforcing our position as Pakistan’s premier financial institution. This underscores our strength, resilience and commitment to value creation and accordingly, the Bank retains its position as the highest capitalised Domestic Systemically Important Bank (DSIB) in the country.

## Chunk 41

# A Conducive Operating Environment

This year we operated in a more conducive and easing environment. Globally, the economy displayed resilience, with reportedly growth stabilizing at 3.2% and inflation moderating to 5.8% allowing central banks to ease monetary tightening. However, long-term structural challenges persist, particularly in developing economies, where debt, investment constraints, and geopolitical risks continue to weigh in on growth.

Domestically, Pakistan’s macroeconomic stability strengthened, with GDP growth at 0.92% in July-Sep FY’25, inflation falling significantly to 2.4% in Jan’ 25, and the policy rate declining from 22% to the expected 12% by early 2025.

External support, including a $7.0 Bn IMF program and a $20.0 Bn World Bank commitment has reinforced economic reforms. The banking sector displayed strong capital buffers, and a smooth IFRS transition along with robust profitability. Looking ahead, sustained policy discipline, political stability, and structural reforms will be key to maintaining this positive trajectory and fostering long-term financial resilience.

## Chunk 42

# Maintaining Strong Financial Delivery

I am pleased to inform that the management has delivered yet another round of solid financial performance in 2024, reaffirming its position as one of the highest value-generating banks in the country. Despite navigating a complex operating environment, the Bank successfully absorbed an extraordinary pension expense without compromising its capital strength, maintaining robust buffers and a steady growth trajectory.

## Chunk 43

# Financial Performance Overview

Net interest income grew to PKR 170.9 Bn, supported by a stable net spread of 2.37%, while non-fund income rising by over 61% to PKR 65.4 Bn. Total revenue grew by 12.9% YoY to PKR 236.3 Bn, showcasing NBP’s strong core banking operations and revenue diversification strategy. While a one-time pension charge impacted the bottom line, the Bank remained operationally resilient, closing the year with after-tax profits of PKR 26.9 Bn and maintaining a strong balance sheet.

The Bank’s total assets grew to PKR 6,744.1 Bn, with shareholder’s assets rising by 19.4% to PKR 457 Bn, translating into book value per share of PKR 214.8 i.e. a YoY growth of 19.4%. Deposits increased by 5.2% to PKR 3,865.6 Bn with a high CASA ratio of 79.4%, enabling a low-cost funding base.

The Bank continued its strategic focus on Islamic banking, achieving a remarkable 137.9% YoY asset growth in NBP Aitemaad-the Banks Shariah compliant business, reaching PKR 333.4 Bn while deposits soaring by 171.9% to PKR 309.4 Bn. NBP’s financial foundation remains solid, enabling the Bank to drive long term value creation while maintaining strong governance and risk management practices.

## Chunk 44

# Implementation of IFRS 9

Implementation of IFRS 9 was a major transition for banks in the country. NBP successfully transitioned to IFRS 9, ensuring compliance with SBP regulations. Despite a significant PKR 12.0 Bn (net of taxes) impact on its opening equity, the Bank achieved significant improvements in its financial soundness indicators. The Bank’s Total eligible capital increased 27.4% to close at PKR 479.8 Bn. CET 1 and total CAR stood at 20.51% and 27.80%, respectively. While leverage ratio stood at 3.88% LCR and NSFR also improved to 206% (2023:176%) and 174% (2023:159%), respectively.

## Chunk 45

# Strengthening Risk & Compliance

We are taking a more proactive and structured approach to strengthening risk & compliance by enhancing credit management frameworks, inculcating a culture of accountability, and setting clear roles of risk-takers and risk-managers. The Board continued its strategy of exiting low-yielding international markets to enhance capital efficiency, minimize compliance risks, and improve returns aligned with the Board’s long-term capital allocation strategy.

We closed the NBP Paris and New York branches in 2024, and Bishkek, Baku and Almaty closures expected by March 2025. The decision to close the New York Branch followed full compliance with regulatory directives, ensuring a structured exit.

## Chunk 46

# Strengthening NBP for the Future

In 2025, the Board’s strategic direction continues to reinforce our resilience and adaptability in an ever-evolving landscape enabling the Bank to deliver positive outcomes for all its stakeholders. Building on the strong foundation laid in the prior years, we remain focused on efficient capital allocation, fortifying our compliance culture, risk management framework and governance structures. The Board and management are committed to steering the Bank towards long-term stability and sustainable growth, ensuring that NBP remains a pillar of financial strength for its stakeholders. We will continue to uphold our commitment to fairness, transparency, and meritocracy, ensuring a work environment where talent is recognized, rewarded and nurtured.

With an increasingly dynamic financial sector, NBP is proactively evolving leveraging technology, refining its business model and expanding its strategic initiatives in Agriculture, SMEs, and Trade. Our unwavering commitment to operational excellence, risk vigilance and regulatory compliance will be key drivers in shaping the Bank’s trajectory in the years to come.

## Chunk 47

# Commitment to our National Role

NBP remains pivotal in supporting public sector entities, recognizing their strategic importance to the national economy. However, challenges persist in ensuring disciplined debt servicing and financial sustainability within this segment. While the Bank has made significant efforts to engage with these entities, the pace of recoveries remains below expectations, exerting pressure on our financial resources.

Additionally, we are advocating for structural reforms within public sector financing, encouraging sustainable business models and improved governance to mitigate future credit risks. By adopting a more strategic and data-driven approach, NBP aims to reinforce its role as a responsible lender while safeguarding the interests of its shareholders and the broader financial system.

## Chunk 48

# Appreciation

I extend my sincere gratitude to my fellow Board members. Their collective wisdom and steadfast commitment have been instrumental in steering the Bank through an evolving financial landscape. I also extend my deep appreciation to the Government of Pakistan, the State Bank of Pakistan, and other regulatory bodies both domestic and international for their continued oversight and support.

To our millions of customers and business partners, your trust and loyalty are the foundation of our success. We remain committed to serving your financial needs with innovation, efficiency and integrity.

Most importantly, I acknowledge and greatly appreciate the dedication, resilience and hard work of our employees which drives the Bank’s continued growth. As we move forward, I am confident that NBP will continue to play a pivotal role in the nation’s economic development further strengthening its position as a trusted financial institution and a major force for positive change.

# Advancing With Purpose

# Reflections from the CEO

We take pride in enabling small enterprises to scale, empowering women owned enterprises, helping industries thrive, and ensuring that financial services are accessible to all segments of society, from urban centres to the most remote areas. This deep-rooted sense of responsibility defines our role as a national institution. Our focus remains steadfast— Ek Azm, Ek Pehchan - National Bank Aur Pakistan. Our annual results reflect this.

## Chunk 50

# Operating Environment

Our performance is significantly influenced by the operating context. Global economic conditions remained uncertain, while macro indicators improved, geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions remain a challenge worldwide. Closer to home, Pakistan’s economic landscape evolved through a complex mix of challenges and opportunities, shaping the financial and business environment in which we operate in.

Pakistan’s GDP initially contracted by 0.2% due to tight monetary policy and fiscal constraints but rebounded to 2.5% growth by year-end. This rebound was primarily fuelled by a resurgence in the agriculture and services sectors, which grew by 1.15% and 1.43% respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024-25. These indicators reflect a gradual return of the economy from stabilisation to growth.

As a result of policies implemented in 2023 and 2024, inflationary pressures eased to 4.1% in December 2024 the lowest in over six years. This downward trend was due mainly to monetary policies and improved supply chain efficiencies. Recognizing the need to further stimulate economic activity, the State Bank of Pakistan implemented a series of policy rate cuts, reducing the key policy rate by a cumulative 1,000 basis points to 13% by end 2024. This action has contributed to easing borrowing costs, and a gradual rise in loan demand.

# Dear Valued Stakeholders

As we step into the 76ᵗʰ year of serving the nation, it is a privilege to address you once again. In my previous review, I outlined key strategic priorities for the Bank, and today, I am pleased to share the progress we have made in translating those commitments into tangible outcomes. I am pleased to say that we have strengthened our foundations, expanded our impact, and navigated the evolving challenges with resilience and foresight.

Our mission extends beyond the conventional boundaries of banking—we are deeply committed to fostering financial inclusion, expanding access to finance, and contributing meaningfully to Pakistan’s economic progress.

Every loan disbursed, every business empowered, and every financial barrier removed is a step towards a more inclusive and prosperous Pakistan.

## Chunk 54

# Translating Strategies into Financial Delivery

Reinforcing our position as a leading commercial bank, NBP continued to be one of the highest value-generating banks in the country. This year we generated PKR 90.0 Bn of additional stakeholders’ value, with total gross revenues reaching PKR 1,155.0 Bn as against PKR 1,065.3 Bn in 2023. With our interest-bearing assets generating gross mark-up income of PKR 1,089.5 Bn, and non-markup income surged by a healthy 61% to PKR 65.8 Bn in 2024.

The year 2024 also came with a challenge, albeit bringing clarity to our path ahead. The Honourable Supreme Court’s pension ruling resulted in an extraordinary one-off and recurring costs, which significantly impacted our profit bottom line by PKR 68.0 Bn.

As we are investing considerably into our human and infrastructure capital, total operating costs (business as usual) stood at PKR 119.8 Bn (that include PKR 10.5 Bn of additional recurring cost impact due to pension case). Moreover, the Bank also recognised a one-off cost of PKR 57.5 Bn on account of pension. After accounting for taxation, net profit of the Bank closed at PKR 26.9 Bn. Excluding the one-off pension impact, our underlying profitability remained strong, demonstrating the resilience of our earnings capacity. As we move forward, we remain focused on driving growth, innovation, and superior returns for our stakeholders.

Amid the evolving regulatory environment with implementation of IFRS 9, we recorded additional provisioning resulting into a reduction (net of tax) in the Bank’s opening retained earnings PKR 10.0 Bn. The Bank now holds credit loss allowances of PKR 225.8 Bn against Stage-3 loans and another PKR 42.1 Bn against Stage-1, Stage-2 loans and as general provisions. This strengthened the Bank’s balance sheet and capital base against unforeseen credit shocks.

the Board to recommend resumption of dividend payout after several years by announcing highest ever 80% dividend in the history of the Bank. This achievement reflects not only the scale and strength of our balance sheet but also our ability to navigate a complex economic landscape and translate strategies into strong financial delivery. My colleagues in the Bank can be very proud of their continued achievements.

## Chunk 56

# Strong Capital Base Amid Extraordinary Costs

In my prior’s review, I had conveyed our commitment to strengthening the Bank to absorb any untoward outcome in the pension case. Although the final judgement in the pension case had a substantial financial impact, the Bank’s Capital Adequacy Ratio stood high at an impressive 27.8% - not just significantly above regulatory requirements of 13% but also the highest in the country. This underscores the Bank’s ability to absorb financial shocks while maintaining stability to play its role as Domestic Systemically Important bank.

NBP is the highest capitalized bank in the country with net assets of PKR 457.0 Bn. The Bank’s financial soundness indicators stand stronger than last year with a total CAR at 27.80%, Leverage at 3.88%, Liquidity Coverage at 174%, Net Stable Funding at 206%. The Bank maintained the highest credit rating of AAA/A1+ for both long term and short term. This financial strength enables the Bank to fulfil its role in Pakistan’s economy —delivering for clients, fostering a great workplace, supporting society, and ensuring shareholder returns.

---

## Chunk 57

# Islamic Banking Expansion – A Defining Transition

As I said in my prior year’s note, Islamic banking is truly synonymous with ’sustainable banking’. We therefore remain committed to growth of Shari’ah compliant banking in Pakistan. In line with our strategy, we achieved strong growth in Aitemaad Islamic banking by recording 140% YoY growth in total Islamic banking assets reaching PKR 333.0 Bn in 2024, up from PKR 140.0 Bn in 2023. We have increased our Islamic banking services to more than 150 cities through 207 branches and over 250 Islamic Banking windows. Depicting a 172% growth YoY, deposits closed.

at PKR 309.0 Bn as of Dec’24, compared to PKR 114.0 Bn of Dec’23. Similarly, the gross financing portfolio also grew by PKR 72.0 Bn or 97% to close at PKR 147.0 Bn.

## Chunk 58

# Overseas Franchise - Strategic Consolidation

In my previous note, I had hinted on strategically de-risking and scaling back of the Bank’s sub-optimal international footprint. We made significant progress in addressing legacy issues facing our international franchise. Improvement was recorded on all fronts – profitability, trade business, remittances, revival of infected loans, and rectification of regulatory observations.

We have successfully closed our branches in Paris and New York. Closures of Bishkek, Baku, and Almaty branches are also progressing at a rapid pace and are expected to be completed by March 2025. Closure of the New York branch followed compliance with regulatory directives, leading to the termination of enforcement actions by the Federal Reserve. These decisive actions, while reflecting our commitment to financial discipline, risk mitigation, and long-term sustainability, also result in significant future cost savings for the Bank.

## Chunk 59

# Financial Inclusion - Empowering Individuals and Communities

NBP has been playing its role in promoting financial inclusion since its inception in 1949. Even before the term ‘financial inclusion’ became a term. We were promoting financial inclusion through our branch network and continue doing so till date. This year we brought ~450K new customers into banking system of which ~150K were women. The Bank’s efforts in Women Financing were acknowledged by SBP by awarding “Women Entrepreneur Financing Awards” to Nine Regions of NBP across the country. This recognition reflects NBP's continued resolve for empowering women entrepreneurs to foster inclusivity for economic growth.

We manage deposits totalling PKR 4.1 trillion for over 7.5 million depositors and have extended loans amounting to PKR 1.7 trillion to more than half a million borrowers. We launched ‘NBP Itmenan’ for senior citizens as a savings product with features that address their financial needs.

Our 'Advance Salary' product continues to address the financial needs of over 250K families nationwide, with fresh disbursements of over PKR 40.0 Bn this year, making it Pakistan’s single largest consumer banking product.

|Profit After Tax|CAR|
|---|---|
|PKR 26.9 Bn|27.80%|

NBP today is proud to be recognized for having the largest number of agricultural borrowers among the commercial banks. We support more than 160K farming families through agriculture loans, with an outstanding portfolio of around PKR 100 Bn as of the end of 2024. The number of female borrower accounts surged to ~42K, reflecting a 15% increase YoY. Concurrently, disbursements to female borrowers rose to PKR 27.0 Bn, a YoY increase of 58%.

In line with our Environmental, Social, and Governance commitments, our 'Roshan Ghar' solar financing scheme is enabling households to install solar panels and promote renewable energy adoption. Number of female borrowers grew from 32K to 38K, with disbursements rising by 50%, from PKR 12.0 Bn to PKR 18.0 Bn. This progress also reflects our dedication to fostering inclusivity and economic empowerment for women in Pakistan.

NBP also plays a pivotal role in corporate financing, providing PKR 650 Bn to large corporations, thereby supporting GDP contribution and employment generation. In 2024 we acted as strategic partner with the Government of Pakistan in enabling various large projects of strategic nature aimed at creating jobs and efficiency in the economy. One of the major milestone/highlight transactions of the year, included, the debt restructuring of the Pakistan International Airline Corp. Ltd. both for its Pak Rupee and USD denominated debt. Furthermore, NBP was instrumental in supporting the efforts and collaborated with Govt. of Sindh, under its Public Private Partnership initiative.

Resultantly, after lapse of almost five years, the Bank’s overseas franchise has started showing signs of improvement achieving 113% YoY growth in profitability (before provisioning) as it reported a profit of USD 3 Mn in 2024 against a loss of USD 22.5 Mn 2023. We achieved 29% YoY growth in overall USD inflows, amounting to USD 1.6 Bn with focused growth from niche corridors. Our strategic decision to exit low yielding markets is expected to bring annual cost saving of ~USD 15 Mn.

These strategic priorities are pursued with a clear perspective—expansion must go hand-in-hand with a national growth agenda ensuring sustainable performance for the Bank.

# Listening to our Stakeholders

Our commitment to stakeholder engagement is evident through proactive platforms like the Pakistan Citizen’s Portal and e-Kacheri sessions, which allow direct communication with the President of NBP. In 2024, we addressed over 3,500 complaints through these channels, ensuring timely and effective resolution. These channels, which enable direct handling of customer issues, are unique to the public sector entities and differentiate us from the

With climate risks remaining a significant challenge—evidenced by ongoing extreme weather patterns—NBP has intensified its efforts to align with the Environmental & Social Risk Management Implementation Manual issued by the SBP, as well as the UN-SDGs. Reinforcing our commitment to responsible banking, a detailed account of the Bank’s CSR initiatives undertaken during the year is presented separately in this report. As of end-2024, the Bank’s green financing portfolio stood at PKR 30.1 billion, underscoring our desire to drive sustainable economic growth.

# Strengthening Our Digital & Technology Capabilities

Technology transformation remains at the forefront of our strategy. The upgrade of our core banking system has gained momentum for roll-out by the mid of 2025 to strengthen our operational agility and digital resilience. This year we invested around PKR 2.0 Bn into our IT system and the Bank will continue to invest in and upgrade its IT posture.

Additionally, our Mobile Banking app continues to gain traction with digital transaction volumes nearly doubling in 2024. With substantial investments in digital platforms, AI-driven insights, and next-generation cybersecurity protocols, we are creating a seamless and secure banking experience for our customers.

# Empowering Our People

Our people remain our greatest asset. In 2024, we took further strides in building a high-performance, future-ready workforce. Over 32K+ trainings were conducted across diverse areas, with a special focus on Islamic banking, digital finance, and leadership development. We also advanced our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion agenda for women. In 2024, NBP received the prestigious Disability Inclusion Champion Award from the Asian Development Bank at the 10th Trade and Supply Chain Awards, recognizing its commitment to fostering a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion.

This year, 13% of new hires were women, and our workforce now includes 1.1% individuals with disabilities, underscoring our dedication to equitable opportunities. Our female colleagues make around 10% of our total workforce.

# Operating Context

The global economy demonstrated resilience amid a complex landscape of easing inflation and cautious optimism. According to the IMF, global growth stabilized at 3.2% in 2024, with projections maintaining this pace into 2025, estimating a growth of 3.3%. Inflationary pressures, a significant concern in previous years, showed signs of easing with global headline inflation receding from 6.8% in 2023 to 5.9% in 2024, suggesting a further reduction to 4.2% by 2025. As a result, many central banks are nearing the conclusion of their monetary tightening cycles, fostering a more conducive financial environment.

Despite these positive developments, challenges persist. The World Bank has highlighted that while global growth is projected to remain stable in both 2025 and 2026, significantly below the pre-pandemic average of 3.1% observed from 2010 to 2019. Developing economies continue to face headwinds such as high debt levels, subdued investment, and the rising geopolitical tensions and climate change impacts.

In summary, as we progress through 2025, the global economic outlook is one of cautious optimism. Concerted policy efforts are essential to address underlying vulnerabilities and to promote sustainable, inclusive development across all economies.

Pakistan’s macroeconomic landscape exhibited significant signs of stabilization and gradual recovery, following the challenges faced in FY’24. GDP growth of 0.92% was reported in the first quarter of FY25, primarily driven by expansions in the agriculture (1.15%) and services (1.43%) sectors, despite a contraction of 1.03% in the industrial sector. Headline inflation has notably declined from nearly 40% in May 2023 to 2.4% in January 2025, with projections ranging between 5.5% and 6.5% by the end of 2025. The monetary policy stance shifted mid-year, with the SBP reducing the policy rate from 22% to 12% by January 2025. This is expected to lower borrowing costs and support private sector credit demand.

# A N N U A L   R E P O R T   2 0 2 4

The external sector has also shown resilience, bolstered by international support. In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7.0 Bn loan for Pakistan, with an immediate disbursement of $1.0 Bn, to support economic reforms and enhance macroeconomic stability. Additionally, the World Bank has committed to a $20.0 Bn lending package over the next decade, focusing on areas such as renewable energy, education, climate resilience, and social sector. The Pakistan Stock Exchange experienced remarkable growth during 2024. The benchmark KSE-100 Index surged by 84% in PKR terms (85% in USD terms), marking one of its best performances in recent years.

Looking ahead, with continued implementation of sound macroeconomic policies, political stability, and structural reforms, Pakistan aims to sustain this positive trajectory, targeting enhanced economic growth and stability in the medium term.

## Chunk 71

# Banking Sector in Pakistan

In 2024, Pakistan’s banking sector maintained strong profitability amid improving economic conditions. The State Bank of Pakistan reported 11.5% expansion in total banking assets during H1CY24, largely due to increased investments in government securities, albeit limited private sector credit growth. Asset quality remained resilient, with non-performing loans staying contained and provisioning coverage improving to 101% by end Sep’24. The sector’s capital buffers remain strong, ensuring financial stability. The implementation of IFRS 9 from January 2024 introduced a more forward-looking approach to credit loss recognition. While one-time provisions were recorded, the sector’s capital adequacy remained sound, with no major impact on overall solvency. Looking ahead, monetary easing, improved market confidence, and continued regulatory reforms are likely to enhance private sector credit flow and support economic recovery in 2025.

# Navigating A Year of Resilience and Strategic Progress

2024 was a challenging yet defining year for the Bank. As discussed in detail in Note 25.3.3.1 to the financial statements, The Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan (in Review Jurisdiction) has, by its order dated 27th March 2024, dismissed all the civil review petitions filed by NBP (CRPs No 368 to 409 etc.), as a result of which the Supreme Court decision dated 25th September 2017, in respect of the pension litigation, has now attained finality. Accordingly, and in compliance of the judgement the Bank has made payments as per the court order. As a matter of prudence, the Bank has incorporated the financial impact in these financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, of any adverse judgement.

Strong Financial Delivery steady growth trajectory. This resilience is a testament to NBP’s financial prudence, proactive risk management, operational strength, and unwavering commitment to sustainable value creation for the stakeholders. The Bank has delivered strong financial results for the year ended December 31, 2024.

# Profitability (PKR ‘Bn)

|11|EPS (Rs.)|12.63|24.37|(11.74)|(48.2%)|

Despite a dynamic and challenging operating environment, NBP continued to demonstrate resilience and adaptability in 2024. As policy rates eased, we saw a significant expansion in interest-bearing assets, driving gross mark-up/interest income to PKR 1,089.4 Bn, slightly above the last year’s PKR 1,024.7 Bn. Interest expenses stood at PKR 918.5 Bn, with 50.1% (2023:PKR 460.5 Bn) paid to depositors. Encouragingly, the Bank’s Cost of Funds improved, declining by 41bps to 15.84% from 16.25% last year. As a result, NII grew by 1.3% YoY to PKR 170.9 Bn, reflecting a net spread of 2.37% for 2024.

Additionally, the Bank’s non-mark-up/non-interest income (NFI) surged by 61.1% to PKR 65.4 Bn, a testament to the Bank’s proactive revenue diversification strategy. This increase was primarily fuelled by capital gains of PKR 27.9 Bn, including PKR 5.8 Bn from the sale of the Bank’s stake in United National Bank Ltd. As a result, total revenue for the year rose by 12.9% YoY to PKR 236.3 Bn.

On the cost front, the Bank remained focused on efficiency while continuing to invest in our people, technology, and infrastructure. The Bank’s operating expenses (BAU) stood at PKR 119.8 Bn, reflecting a 28.3% YoY increase. A large part of this was driven by HR costs, which rose by 39.7% to PKR 78.8 Bn, primarily due to additional recurring cost impact of the pension case.

However, the year was not without its challenges. The Supreme Court’s ruling on the pension case resulted in an extraordinary cost as well as recurring cost having significant impact on the Bank’s financials. Yet, despite this major headwind, the Bank remained steadfast, maintaining a strong balance sheet and capital position. Profit before tax closed at PKR 56.7 Bn, reflecting a 44.0% decline YoY, while after-tax profit stood at PKR 26.9 Bn, down 48.2% from last year’s PKR 51.8 Bn. Had there been no one-off pension cost impact, PBT would have closed 12.8% higher YoY at PKR 114.2 Bn.

# A Strong Balance Sheet

The Bank’s end of 2024 total assets closed at PKR 6,744.1 Bn which represents a 1.4% increase from PKR 6,652.7 Bn at the end of 2023. Capital & reserves closed at PKR 457.0 Bn, an increase of PKR 74.5 Bn or 19.4% up from PKR 382.8 Bn as of December 31, 2023.

|No.|Key Items Item|2024|2023|Growth|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Investments (net)|4,612.3|4,403.4|4.7%|
|2|Advances (net)|1,404.9|1,398.1|0.5%|
|3|Total Assets of the Bank|6,744.1|6,652.7|1.4%|
|4|Islamic Banking Total Assets|333.4|140.2|37.8%|
|5|Deposits|3,865.6|3,674.4|5.2%|
|6|Borrowings|1,937.8|2,177.7|(11.0%)|
|7|Net Assets|457.0|382.8|19.4%|
|8|Book Value Per Share|214.8|179.9|19.4%|

Gross loans & advances of the Bank stood at PKR 1,672.8 Bn depicting a YoY increase of 2.5% or PKR 41.1 Bn, whereas net advances closed at PKR 1,404.9 Bn. Growth in average advances was achieved in most of the Bank’s products including SME & commercial, agriculture, Islamic, consumer, and advances to women, women owned and managed enterprises. Consequently, the advances-to-deposits ratio stood at 43.3% at the end of 2024. Non-performing loans recorded a surge of 21.9% and amounted to PKR 269.3 Bn (2023: PKR 220.8 Bn). However, this was mainly due to delinquency in a single large borrower which is expected to be regularised shortly and does not attract provisioning. With PKR 225.8 Bn of credit loss allowances held, NPL coverage ratio stood high at 83.9%. Excluding the impact of this single large delinquency, the coverage ratio stands above 100%.

Demonstrating its commitment, the Bank expanded its Islamic Banking footprint in 2024 by adding over 100 Islamic Banking Windows ‘IBW’, bringing the total to 251, and converting 19 conventional branches into full-fledged Islamic branches. The Islamic banking business is now one of the fastest growing segments within the Bank. NBP Itimad’s total assets increased to PKR 333.4 Bn at the end 2024 from PKR 140.2 Bn at the end 2023 recording record growth of 137.9% YoY. Whereas total Islamic banking earning assets recorded a 138.3% YoY growth reaching PKR 298.9 Bn compared to 125.4 Bn at end 2023. NBP Aitemaad offers the entire spectrum of banking products, from large-ticket corporate deals to retail deposits and consumer finance.

The Bank’s Islamic Banking franchise ‘NBP Aitemaad’ closed deposit at PKR 309.4 Bn at the end 2024, compared to PKR 113.8 Bn depicting a 171.9% YoY growth, while CASA growth was 198.2% YoY. At end of 2024, total deposit customers stood at 250K, showing a YoY increase of 12%. With total operating income of PKR 10.7 Bn (30.83% up YoY), Islamic banking operations posted pre-tax profit of PKR 6.33 Bn, depicting a massive 79.43% growth YoY.

In line with the Federal Shariat Court’s directives and the State Bank of Pakistan’s mandate to transition the banking industry to full Sharia’h compliance by December 31, 2027, the Bank plans to accelerate this transformation by establishing another 100 IBWs and converting over 100 conventional branches to Islamic in 2025. On the asset side, the launch of NBP Aitemaad Advance Salary, an Islamic alternative to the Bank’s flagship retail lending product, marks a significant milestone. The Bank remains committed to introducing further Shari’ah-compliant alternatives, ensuring a seamless transition while strengthening its position as a leader in Islamic banking.

Detailed coverage of the financial performance and other organizational development is also given elsewhere in this Annual Report 2024.

# Impact of the Government Policies on the Bank’s Performance

As a major financial institution, NBP operates in close alignment with government policies, which present both opportunities and challenges for the Bank. Several policy measures have had a material impact on the Bank’s performance, including:

- Mandatory participation in subsidized lending schemes that support inclusive economic development but also require careful risk management.
- Deposit protection premium obligations that contribute to financial safety of depositors but increase cost pressures.
- Implementation of the Treasury Single Account which influences deposit mobilization and liquidity management.

Furthermore, as a major lender to various public sector entities, the Bank continues to face challenges related to delayed or, in some cases, non-performing debt obligations from certain state-owned enterprises. This remains a key factor impacting the Bank’s income and asset quality.

Despite these challenges, NBP remains steadfast in its commitment to fulfilling its role as a national institution, supporting government initiatives while ensuring sustainable profitability and value creation for all shareholders. The Bank continues to engage with policymakers to strike a balance between national priorities and prudent banking practices.

NBP’s future performance remains closely linked to Pakistan’s macroeconomic trajectory, which continues to be influenced by inflationary pressures, interest rate movements, fiscal policies, political stability, and global economic conditions.

Against this backdrop, NBP remains committed to supporting economic recovery and sustainable growth while maintaining a strong and resilient balance sheet. The Bank’s strategic focus in near future will continue to be on:

- Expanding financial inclusion, particularly in SMEs, microfinance, and agriculture.
- Supporting Government-led subsidized schemes that drive economic stability.
- Strengthening Islamic banking as demand for Shari’ah-compliant products grows.
- Enhancing digital transformation to improve efficiency and accessibility.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REVIEW REPORT

Review report to the Members on the Statements of Compliance with the Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019 and Public Sector Companies (Corporate Governance) Rules, 2013

We have reviewed the enclosed Statement of Compliance with the best practices contained in the Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019 (the Regulations), Public Sector Companies (Corporate Governance) Rules, 2013 (the Rules) (both herein referred to as ‘Codes’) and Banks (Nationalisation) Act, 1974 prepared by the Board of Directors of National Bank of Pakistan (the Bank) for the year ended December 31, 2024 to comply with the requirements of regulation 36 of the Regulations and the provisions of the Rules.

The responsibility for compliance with the Codes is that of the Board of Directors of the Bank. Our responsibility is to review, to the extent where such compliance can be objectively verified, whether the Statement of Compliance reflects the status of the Bank’s compliance with the provisions of the Codes and report if it does not and to highlight any non-compliance with the requirements of the Codes. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of the Bank’s personnel and review of various documents prepared by the Bank to comply with the Codes.

As a part of our audit of the financial statements we are required to obtain an understanding of the accounting and internal control systems sufficient to plan the audit and develop an effective audit approach. We are not required to consider whether the Board of Directors’ statement on internal control covers all risks and controls or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of such internal controls, the Bank’s corporate governance procedures and risks.

The Codes require the Bank to place before the Audit Committee, and upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, place before the Board of Directors for their review and approval its related party transactions distinguishing between transactions carried out on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arms’ length transactions and transactions which are not executed at arm’s length price and recording proper justification for using such alternate pricing mechanism. We are only required and have ensured compliance of this requirement to the extent of the approval of the related party transactions by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee. We have not carried out any procedures to determine whether the related party transactions were undertaken at arm’s length price or not.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the ‘Statement of Compliance’ does not appropriately reflect the Bank’s compliance, in all material respects, with the best practices contained in the Codes as applicable to the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2024.

# STATEMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL

# REPORTING OF INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM

# EVALUATION OF INTERNAL CONTROLS

The Bank's management has established and is managing a system of internal controls, approved by the Board of Directors, to achieve effective and efficient operations, while complying with applicable laws and regulations and preserving the reliability of financial reporting. This internal control system comprises of various interrelated components to gauge the overall control environment. These components include the availability of well-documented policies and procedures and their compliance, risk assessment, identification of risks and mitigating controls, technology governance, information security, and management reporting.

The management and the employees at all levels within the Bank are required to perform their duties as per defined guidelines. The internal control system also requires effective and efficient external and internal reporting, adequate MIS, maintenance of proper records and processes, operational loss database management, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and internal policies with respect to the conduct of business. The Bank remains cognizant of its responsibility to continuously improve and strengthen its system of internal control on an ongoing basis to address evolving risks and operational challenges. The Bank has successfully implemented Internal Control Over Financial Reporting ("ICFR") roadmap and obtained the statutory auditor's Long Form report for 2023, as mandated by the State Bank. However, management recognizes that while ICFR implementation marks significant progress in financial reporting controls, the broader internal control framework requires further enhancement to ensure comprehensive risk management and operational efficiency.

The Bank's internal control system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve objectives under a dynamic environment. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system, including the possibility of human error or system failure, circumvention and overriding of control. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system can only provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives.

Based on the results achieved from review of controls by management during the year along with Compliance Group, Internal Control Division within Operations, Internal Control over Financial Reporting by Financial Control Group and Internal Audit performed by Audit & Inspection Group, the management considers that the Bank's existing internal control system needs further improvement to address emerging risks and operational complexities. This is an ongoing process, and management would continuously be evaluating the efficacy of its in-built controls to enhance and further strengthen the overall control framework of the Bank.

Based on the above, the Board of Directors has endorsed the management's evaluation of internal controls including ICFR in the Director's report.

# Loans and Advances

At Dec-2024, gross loans & advances of the Bank amounted to PKR 1,672.8 Bn depicting a 2.52% prudent increase from the year end 2023 levels. The loan book is diversified over 30+ sectors. Private and Public sector constitute 63.9% (2023: 60.5%) and 36.1% (2023: 39.5%), respectively. With PKR 183.2 Bn, Individuals make 11% of the loan book whereas Power makes 9.6% share and PKR 160.2 Bn in outstanding loans, followed by 9.5% of the Textile sector where the exposure decreased by 1.1% YoY to reach PKR 158.4 Bn. Oil & Gas recorded a decline of 13.2% growth to reach PKR 270.7 Bn from PKR 311.9 Bn in 2023. In line with the Bank’s refreshed vision of inclusive development, healthy growth was also achieved in Commodity and Agriculture & Allied sectors. These 4 major sectors make almost 46.2% of the total loan book with PKR 772.5 Bn in outstanding.

With PKR 269.3 Bn of NPLs at end of 2024, net loans & advances amounted to PKR 1,404.9 Bn i.e. 0.48% up from PKR 1398.1 Bn level at end 2023. Given the focused decline in deposits and a prudent growth in advances, the Bank’s Advances-to-Deposits Ratio (gross) declined from 44.5% at the end of Dec’23 to 43.3% at end Dec’24.

Business groups that contributed towards YoY growth in advances include C&IBG (-PKR 83.9Bn), IDG (+PKR 92.2 Bn), RBG (+PKR 19.2 Bn), and AIBG (+PKR 72.2 Bn), etc.

# Investments

At the end of 2024, the Bank’s investments (fair value/amortized cost) amounted to PKR 4,475.4 Bn (YE’23: PKR 4,393.9 Bn), making over two-third of the Bank’s balance sheet. Given the limited quality loan-growth opportunities, and a constant growth in the customer deposits, excess liquidity with the Bank is placed in shorter term GoP securities to capitalize on price volatility in the hiking policy rate environment. The PKR 81.5 Bn or 1.9% increase in investments (at cost) mostly came in T-Bills that increased by PKR 210.5 Bn from PKR 977.9 Bn at the YE’23 to PKR 1,188.4 Bn at end Dec’24. PIBs decreased by PKR 171.4 Bn from PKR 3,154.2 Bn at the YE’23 to PKR 2,982.8 Bn at end Dec’24. As the market opportunity offered decent spread, investments were funded through deposit mobilization as well as leveraging.

## Chunk 158

# Interest Expensed

The increase in mark-up expense reflects the impact of volumetric growth in deposits and borrowings coupled with the impact of revision in profit rates in line with the policy rate increase from time to time. Responding to the increasing discount rate, the Bank has been particularly active in mobilizing low-cost CASA deposits. Satisfactory results have been delivered in this regard by both conventional as well as Islamic banking operations. During the year 2024, the average policy rate remained at 19.66% compared to 20.69% of last year. This translates into an average decrease in the policy rate by 103bps. As a consequent of that, the Bank recorded a decrease in cost of funds of 41bps to 15.84% for 2024 (2023: 16.25%).

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# Following are the Key Audit Matters:

|S.No.|Key Audit Matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|Credit loss allowance against advances (Refer notes 2.9, 11.4 and 34 to the unconsolidated financial statements)|The Bank records credit loss allowance against advances in Pakistan operations in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. Under IFRS 9, the Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the Expected Credit Losses ('ECL') associated with all advances and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments. A lifetime ECL is recorded on advances in which there have been Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) from the date of initial recognition and on advances which are credit impaired as on the reporting date. A 12 months ECL is recorded for advances which do not meet the criteria for SICR or "credit impaired" as at the reporting date. To assess whether there is a significant increase in the credit risk, the Bank compares the risk of a default occurring on the advances as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. Both lifetime and 12 months ECL are calculated at facility level. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account and is decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. The Bank records charge for Stage 3 exposures based on the higher of provision under Prudential Regulations or ECL under IFRS 9, as per the instructions of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). This assessment is conducted at the facility level for corporate, commercial, and SME loan portfolios, and at a segment level for the retail portfolio. If one facility of a counterparty becomes 90+ days past due (DPD) or is otherwise defined as impaired under Prudential Regulations, all other facilities of that counterparty are classified as Stage 3. The measurement of ECL involves evaluating a range of possible outcomes, considering the time value of money, and incorporating reasonable and supportable information available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions. Provisions pertaining to overseas advances are made in accordance with the requirements of regulatory authorities of the respective countries. Our audit procedures to verify credit loss allowance against domestic advances included, amongst others, the following: We obtained and updated our understanding of management’s assessment of credit loss allowance in respect of advances including the Bank’s internal rating model, accounting policy, model methodology including any key changes made during the year. We obtained an understanding of the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the relevant controls established by the Bank to identify loss events and for determining the extent of provisioning required against advances. The testing of controls included testing of: > controls over correct classification of advances; > controls over monitoring of advances with higher risk of default and correct classification of non-performing advances on subjective criteria; > controls over accurate computation and recording of provisions; > controls over the governance and approval process related to provisions, including continuous reassessment by the management. We selected a sample of loan accounts and performed the following substantive procedures: > assessed the reasonableness and accuracy of the data used for ECL computation based on accounting records and information system of the Bank as well as the related external sources used for this purpose; > checked repayments of loans / mark-up instalments and tested classification of advances based on the number of days overdue; > tested the staging of loans and advances as per the criteria of SICR and in accordance with IFRS 9; > evaluated the management’s assessment for classification of a borrower’s loan facilities as performing or non-performing based on review of repayment pattern, inspection of credit documentation and discussions with the management; > assessed the ECL model used by the management to calculate expected credit loss against advances balances of the Bank for appropriateness of the assumptions used and the methodology applied. We also tested the mathematical accuracy of the model; > assessed the reasonableness of the forward-looking assumptions used by the management in calculation of ECL; and > assessed the relevant disclosures made in the unconsolidated.|

|S.No.|Key Audit Matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|The Bank has recognised a net credit loss allowance against advances amounting to Rs. 6,113.132 million in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account in the current year. As at December 31, 2024, the Bank holds a credit loss allowance including general provision of Rs. 267,895.123 million against advances. The determination of credit loss allowance against advances based on the above criteria remains a significant area of judgment and estimation. Because of the significance of the impact of these judgments / estimations and the materiality of advances relative to the overall unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank, we considered this area as a key audit matter.|We issued instructions to auditors of those overseas branches which were selected for audit, highlighting ‘Credit loss allowance against financial assets and off-balance items’ as a significant risk. The auditors of those branches performed audit procedures to check compliance with regulatory requirements and reported the results thereof to us. We, as auditors of the Bank, evaluated the work performed by the component auditors and the results thereof.|
|2|Pension benefits liability (Refer notes 21, 25.3.3.1, 32.2 and 40.4 to the unconsolidated financial statements) The Bank operates an approved funded pension scheme for its eligible employees. The valuation for pension benefits is carried out annually by the actuary appointed by the management of the Bank using the projected unit cost method. A number of the Bank’s employees had filed writ petitions before the Lahore High Court and Peshawar High Court with respect to their pensionary benefits in prior years. The Supreme Court of Pakistan (SCP) in September 2017 after hearing the arguments of both parties decided the case against the Bank. The Bank had subsequently filed review petitions against the judgement of the SCP.|Our audit procedures to verify pension benefits liability included, amongst others, the following: > Reviewed the Supreme Court's order and checked the Bank’s compliance with the judgment, including payments made to pensioners on a test basis; > Reviewed minutes of the meeting of the Board of Directors for discussions held with respect to the pension litigation and liability; > Obtained and reviewed the management expert’s actuarial report supporting the calculation of pension obligations and evaluated key actuarial assumptions; > Engaged an independent actuarial expert to assess the reasonableness of the pension liability determined by the management’s actuary along with the related assumptions; and > Evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures made in the unconsolidated financial statements to ensure compliance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan.|

During the year, the SCP has by its order dated March 27, 2024, dismissed all the civil review petitions filed by the Bank, as a result of which the Supreme Court’s decision dated September 25, 2017 in respect of the pension litigation, has now attained finality. Accordingly, and in compliance of the judgement, the Bank has made payments to majority of petitioners as well as non-petitioners. In addition, the SCP has also directed the Bank to pay arrears of any government increases in pension to the petitioners.

# 1. Key Audit Matter

As a result of the above decision, the management has recognised a past service cost of Rs. 57,549 million based on the valuation carried out by the management’s actuary in the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2024. The net present value of the Bank’s obligation against pension scheme as at December 31, 2024, amounted to Rs. 75,638 million. The determination of pension benefits liability as per the order of the SCP required certain estimates and judgments to be made including actuarial assumptions. The calculation of pension benefits remains an area of significant estimate and judgment. Because of the significance of the impact of these judgments / estimations and the materiality of the amount in the overall context of the unconsolidated financial statements, we considered this as a key audit matter.

# 2. Information Other than the Unconsolidated and Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditors’ Reports Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the unconsolidated and consolidated financial statements and our auditors’ reports thereon. Our opinion on the unconsolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the unconsolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Chunk 182

# 3. Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the unconsolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.

## Chunk 183

# 4. Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement.

Misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the unconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the unconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

However, no benefit of FSV of non-liquid collateral has been taken into account during the year in calculating the provisioning amount. General provisions for loan losses for overseas branches are made as per the requirements of the respective central banks.

# b) Fair value of derivatives

The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant interest and exchange rates over the term of the contract.

# c) Impairment of FVOCI investments

Impairment in respect of unquoted shares is calculated with reference to break-up value. Break-up value is calculated with reference to the net assets of the Investee Company as per the latest available audited financial statements. Provision and ECL for unquoted debt securities is calculated as per SBP's Prudential Regulations and IFRS-9 respectively. A financial instrument that is not credit-impaired on initial recognition is classified in 'Stage 1' and has its credit risk continuously monitored by the Bank. If a significant increase in credit risk ('SICR') since initial recognition is identified, the financial instrument is moved to 'Stage 2' but is not yet deemed to be credit-impaired. If the financial instrument is credit-impaired, the financial instrument is then moved to 'Stage 3' and impairment ECL of stage 3 impairment of FVOCI quoted TFCs, PTC, Ijarah Sukuks & Government Bonds is recognized in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations and other directives issued by SBP as per subjective and objective criteria of Prudential Regulations after taking into account of FSV benefit under Prudential Regulations and IFRS-9.

# e) Income taxes

In making the estimates for current and deferred taxes, the management looks at the income tax law and the decisions of appellate authorities on certain issues in the past. There are certain matters where the Bank’s view differs with the view taken by the income tax department and such amounts are shown as contingent liabilities.

## Chunk 208

# f) Property and Equipment, Non-Banking asset and intangible assets, revaluation, depreciation and amortisation

In making estimates of the depreciation / amortisation method, the management uses the method which reflects the pattern in which economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Bank. The method applied is reviewed at each financial year end and if there is a change in the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the assets, the method is changed to reflect the change in pattern.

The Bank also revalues its properties on a periodic basis. Such revaluations are carried out by independent valuer and involves estimates / assumptions and various market factors and conditions.

## Chunk 209

# g) Defined benefit plans including pension expense

The liabilities for employees' benefits plans are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations involve assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases, future inflation rates and future pension increases as disclosed in note 40. Due to the long term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.

# h) Provision against contingencies

Provision against contingencies is determined based on the management judgement regarding the probability of future outflows of resources embodying economic benefits to settle an obligation arising from past events.

---

## Chunk 210

# i) Lease liability against right of use assets

The Bank applies judgement to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized.

Moreover, management exercises judgement in establishing the discount rate for new leases, utilizing the incremental borrowing rate as a benchmark.

## Chunk 211

# j) Classification of financial assets and liabilities

The classification of financial asset is determined through solely payment of principal and interest (SPPI) criteria and business model of the Bank. The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The financial liabilities are being carried at amortised cost except for derivatives which are being measured at FVTPL.

## Chunk 212

# k) Contingent assets and contingent liabilities

Contingent assets are not recognised, and are also not disclosed unless an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognised but are disclosed unless the probability of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits are remote.

# 6.1 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

As per the SBP BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9 is applicable on banks with effect from January 01, 2024. IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of accounting for financial liabilities. To determine appropriate classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments, to be assessed based on combination of the entity's business model for managing the assets and the instruments' contractual cash flows characteristics. The adoption of IFRS 9 has also fundamentally changed the impairment method of financial assets with a forward-looking Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach.

The SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 dated January 22, 2025 (Letters) has made certain amendments and clarified the timelines of some of the SBP's IFRS 9 Application Instructions to address the matters raised by the banks to ensure compliance by the timelines. The Letters have provided clarifications / relaxations on measurement of unquoted equity securities, modification accounting, maintenance of general provisions over and above ECL, accounting methodology for Islamic Banking Institutions and treatment of charity. Accordingly, the Bank has adopted the treatment as instructed in the aforementioned Letters in these unconsolidated financial statements. In addition, the SBP in a separate instruction SBPHOK-BPRD-RPD-NBP-821909 dated January 22, 2025 has allowed extension for application of Effective Interest Rate up to December 31, 2025.

On application of IFRS 9, certain accounting policies have been revised to comply with the requirements of IFRS 9. The revised accounting policies have been disclosed in their respective policy notes in these unconsolidated financial statements.

The SBP has directed the Banks through its BPRD Circular Letter No.1 dated January 22, 2025 to disclose the impact of IFRS 9 on revenue recognition from Islamic Operations which is as follows: Had IFRS 9 been adopted in its entirety for revenue recognition from Islamic operations profit / return earned on Islamic financing and related assets in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account for the year ended December 31, 2024 would have been higher by Rs. 135 million and taxation would have been higher by Rs 73 million. Further, an unappropriated profit in unconsolidated statement of changes in equity would have been higher by Rs 62 million.

a) These are measured at amortised cost if these assets meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL):

- the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

The Bank’s business model for these financial assets can still be held to collect (HTC) even when sales of these financial assets occur. However, if more than an infrequent number of sales of significant value are made, the Bank assesses whether and how the sales are consistent with the HTC objective.

b) Debt based financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) only if these meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as FVTPL:

- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

c) Debt based financial assets if these are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI or at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

The Bank performed a detailed analysis of its business models for managing financial assets and analysis of their contractual cash flows characteristics.

# 6.2 Classification

Financial assets

Under IFRS 9, existing categories of financial assets: Held for trading (HFT), Available for sale (AFS), Held to maturity (HTM) and loans and receivables have been replaced by:

- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss account (FVTPL)
- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- Financial assets at amortised cost

Financial liabilities

Under IFRS 9, the accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus financial liabilities are being carried at amortised cost except for derivatives which are being measured at FVTPL.

---

## Chunk 252

# 6.2.1 Business model:

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Bank's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Bank's key management personnel;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank’s assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:

1. Hold to Collect (HTC) business model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash
2. Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S) business model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
3. Other business models: Resulting in classification of financial assets as FVTPL

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# 6.2.2 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest / profit (SPPI)

As a second step of its classification process, the Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. ‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium / discount). The most significant elements of interest / profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as, but not limited to, the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest / profit rate is set. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL.

---

## Chunk 254

# 6.2.3 Application to the Bank's financial assets

# Debt based financial assets

Debt based financial assets held by the Bank include: advances, lending to financial institutions, investment in federal government securities, corporate bonds and other private sukuks, cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks, and other financial assets.

a) These are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as FVTPL:

- the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

The Bank’s business model for these financial assets can still be HTC even when sales of these financial assets occur. However, if more than an infrequent number of sales of significant value are made, the Bank assesses whether and how the sales are consistent with the HTC objective.

b) Debt based financial assets are measured at FVOCI only if these meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as FVTPL:

- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

c) Debt based financial assets if these are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

---

## Chunk 255

# Equity instruments

Equity instruments are instruments that meet the definition of equity from the issuer's perspective; that is, instruments that do not contain a contractual obligation to pay and that evidence a residual share in the issuer's net assets. The Bank measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, except where the Bank's management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Bank's policy is to designate equity investments as FVOCI when

---

## Chunk 256

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

those investments are held for purposes other than for trading. When this election is used, fair value gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to the statement of profit and loss account, including on disposal. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return on such investments, continue to be recognised in the statement of profit and loss account as income when the Bank's right to receive payments is established.

IFRS 9 has removed the requirement for impairment assessments on equity investments. However, under BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024, dated July 29, 2024, Banks may continue to measure unquoted equity securities at the lower of cost or break-up value until December 31, 2024. Starting January 1, 2025, Banks will be required to measure unquoted equity securities at fair value, as mandated by the IFRS 9 application guidelines. For unquoted securities where the break-up value is lower than the cost, the difference has been classified as a loss and charged to the statement of profit and loss account.

Gains and losses on equity instruments at FVTPL are included in the ‘Gain on sales of securities’ line in the statement of profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 257

# 6.2.4 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Bank purchases or sells the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like advances, lending to financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account or financial institutions. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased.

---

## Chunk 258

# a) Amortised cost (AC)

Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Interest income / profit / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 259

# b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for debt based financial assets in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of debt based financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is transferred from surplus / deficit to unappropriated profit.

---

## Chunk 260

# c) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs will be directly recorded in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Interest / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

## Chunk 261

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# 6.2.5 Derecognition

Financial assets

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its unconsolidated annual statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the unconsolidated financial statement of profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 262

# 6.2.6 Modification

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of financing to its customers. The Bank assesses whether the modified terms result in the financial asset being significantly modified and therefore derecognised. When the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified and the renegotiation or modification does not result in the derecognition of that financial asset in accordance with IFRS 9, the Bank recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset and shall recognise a modification gain or loss in unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. The gross carrying amount of the financial asset is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (or credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets). Any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

---

## Chunk 263

# 6.3 Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with all advances and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Bank recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money; and
- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

---

## Chunk 264

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject customer. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 60 days past due.

When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Bank applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. Based on the above process, the Bank groups its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3, as described below:

---

## Chunk 265

# Stage 1:

When financial instruments are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

---

## Chunk 266

# Stage 2:

When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

# Stage 3:

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises the LTECLs for these instruments. The Bank uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP.

---

## Chunk 267

# Undrawn financing commitments:

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the financings is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. For revolving facilities that include both a financings and an undrawn commitment, ECLs are calculated on un-drawn portion of the facility and presented within other liabilities.

---

## Chunk 268

# Guarantee and letters of credit contracts:

The Bank estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven and internally developed credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit contracts respectively. The calculation is made using a probability weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within other liabilities.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# The calculation of ECLs

The Bank calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash flows, discounted at an approximation to the EIR.

The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:

---

## Chunk 270

# PD

The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the last 11 years. PDs for Non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.

# EAD

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest / profit from missed payments. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has a legal right to call it earlier. The Bank's product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail facilities, in which the Bank has the right to cancel and / or reduce the facilities with one day notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Bank does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the Bank expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the Bank future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

---

## Chunk 272

# LGD

The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD.

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective interest rate (at reporting date), the Bank uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date). Effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The Bank considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics:

- History of legal certainty and enforceability
- History of enforceability and recovery

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three scenarios (a base case, a best case, a worst case). Each of these is associated with different PDs.

The Bank's management has only considered cash, liquid securities, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals, while calculating EADs.

The credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level for corporate / commercial / SME loan portfolios and at segment / product basis for retail portfolio.

# Forward looking information

In its ECL models, the Bank relies on range of the following forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

- GDP Growth
- Consumer Price Index
- Unemployment rate

## Chunk 274

# Definition of default

The concept of "impairment" or "default" is critical to the implementation of IFRS 9 as it drives determination of risk parameters, i.e. PD, LGD and EAD.

As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level for corporate / commercial / SME loan portfolios and at segment / product basis for retail portfolio.

This implies that if one facility of a counterparty becomes 90+ DPD in repaying its contractual dues or as defined in PRs; all other facilities would deem to be classified as stage 3.

# Write-offs

The Bank's accounting policy under IFRS 9 remains the same as it was under SBP regulations / existing reporting framework.

## Chunk 275

# 6.4 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held-for-sale

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held-for-sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of derecognition.

Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the statement of financial position. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the statement of financial position.

# 25.3.3 Contingencies in respect of employees benefits and related matters

The following are the details of the contingencies arising out of the various legal cases pending adjudication in respect of employees’ benefits and related matters. The Bank considers that except for Pensionary benefits note 25.3.3.1, the financial impact of other matters is impracticable to determine with sufficient reliability.

---

## Chunk 370

# 25.3.3.1 Pensionary benefits to retired employees

The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan (in Review Jurisdiction) has, by its order dated 27th March 2024, dismissed all the civil review petitions filed by NBP (CRPs No 368 to 409 etc.), as a result of which the Supreme Court decision dated 25th September 2017, in respect of the pension litigation, has now attained finality. Accordingly, and in compliance of the judgement bank has made payments to majority of petitioners as well as non-petitioners.

The Honorable Supreme Court has also directed NBP to pay the arrears of any government increases in pension but to only pensioners who are directly involved and are parties in the aforesaid litigation. However, as things stand at the moment, an off-shoot of the said litigation is presently pending final adjudication in the Supreme Court wherein a different class of pensioners are claiming payment of government increases in pension from NBP. In this case, the Supreme Court has granted NBP interim relief and has suspended the operation of the judgment of the Lahore High Court which had directed NBP to pay such pension increases. As a result, there are now two different views of the Honorable Supreme Court vis a vis the payment of government increases in pension to the pensioners of NBP and the legal position is far from being clear or certain. However, as a matter of abundant caution the Bank has incorporated financial impact in these unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.

# 25.3.3.2 Regularizing the temporary hires / workers deployed by service provider companies under outsourcing arrangements

The Bank outsourced certain non-core jobs to various service provider companies after entering into contracts with them. The resources deployed by the service provider companies were their employees and the said companies have had sole administrative control over these resources. Some of these resources filed writ petitions before the High Courts and National Industrial Relations Commission (NIRC) seeking to be absorbed by the Bank in its regular service based on grounds that they were in fact employees of the Bank. Presently, there are 6 cases on appeal pending at the Supreme Court where these have been clubbed to be heard as one. The Chief Justice of Pakistan has constituted a larger bench comprising of five Judges being headed by himself for adjudication. The case is ongoing and is presently adjourned for a date to be fixed. A favorable outcome of this case is expected.

# 25.4 Foreign exchange repatriation case

While adjudicating Foreign Exchange repatriation cases of exporter namely: M/S Fateh Textile Mills Limited, the
Foreign Exchange Adjudicating Court of the State Bank of Pakistan has also adjudicated penalty of Rs. 1,020
million, arbitrarily on the Bank. The Bank has filed appeals before the Appellate Board and Constitutional
Petitions in the Honorable High Court of Sindh against the said judgments. The Honorable High Court has
granted relief to the Bank by way of interim orders.

As advised by our counsel, NBP has also filed a Constitutional Petition challenging the constitution of the
Appellate Board by the Commission and has obtained restraining order on the ground that the Appellate Board
constituted by the Commission lacks legal merit in the light of Supreme Court ruling. Our counsel has
concluded his arguments in respect of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Appellate Board constitution.
However, another petition filed by another company whereby challenging the constitutionality of the
Competition Act was also tagged with the petitions filed by the banks.

Based on merits of the appeals management is confident that these appeals shall be decided in favor of the
Bank and therefore, no provision has been made against the impugned penalty.

# 25.5 Compliance and risk matters relating to anti-money laundering at the New York Branch

The bank fully complied with the public enforcement actions issued in February 2022 by the New York State
Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) and the Federal Reserve Board. It thereafter decided to close the
New York branch. With approval from the NYDFS, the bank’s New York branch voluntarily surrendered its
banking license to the NYSDFS in October 2024. In December 2024, the Federal Reserve Board terminated the
enforcement actions issued to NBP/New York Branch in March 2016 & February 2022. The NYSDFS does not
have a practice of terminating enforcement actions.

# 40.14 Funding policy

The bank should disclose the policy followed for funding the staff retirement benefit schemes.

|Current Assets|Amount|Percentage|
|---|---|---|
|Cash and cash equivalents - net|355,898|0.52%|
|Government securities|65,336,734|95.11%|

| |68,693,334|100.00%|

Bank will continue to invest with the same percentage in the asset categories mentioned but increase the assets gradually so that there is no deficit in the pension fund.

## Chunk 403

# 40.15 Significant risks associated with the staff retirement benefit schemes are as follows:

Asset volatility: The risk arises when the future earnings are lower than expectation. This risk is measured at a plan level over the obligation period of the current population. The company assets are either invested in fixed securities or cash.

Changes in bond yields: The risk arises when the actual return on plan assets is lower than expectation.

Inflation risk: The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the benefit is linked with last drawn salary. The risk arises when the actual increases are higher than expectation and impacts the liability accordingly.

Life expectancy / withdrawal rate: The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population. The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

Investment Risk: The risk arises when the actual performance of the investments is lower than expectation and thus creating a shortfall in the funding objectives.

## Chunk 404

# 41 DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

# 43 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified under held to collect model, is based on quoted market price. Quoted Instruments classified under "held to collect" are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed-term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed-term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

## Chunk 411

# 43.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyzes financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 47 CAPITAL ADEQUACY, LEVERAGE RATIO & LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS

The Bank's objectives when managing capital, which is a broader concept than the 'equity' on the face of the statement of financial position, are:

- to comply with the capital requirements set by the regulators of the banking markets where the Bank operates;
- to safeguard the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and
- to maintain a strong capital base to support the development of its business.

The SBP has issued instructions for Basel-III Implementation vide BPRD Circular No. 06 of 2013 dated August 15, 2013. These instructions were effective from December 31, 2013 in a phased manner with full implementation intended by December 31, 2019.

Basel-III instructions comprise the following three capital standards:

1. Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR):
The MCR standard sets the nominal amount of capital banks/ DFIs are required to hold. Currently the MCR for banks and DFIs is Rs. 10 billion as prescribed by SBP.
2. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR):
The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) assesses the capital requirement based on the risks faced by the banks/ DFIs. The banks/ DFIs are required to comply with the minimum requirements as specified by the SBP on standalone as well as consolidated basis. Currently the required CAR for banks is 11.50% (plus 1.50% for NBP as D-SIB requirement).
3. Leverage Ratio:
Tier-1 Leverage Ratio of 3% is introduced in response to Basel III Accord as the third capital standard. Bank level disclosure of the leverage ratio and its components has started from December 31, 2015. However, SBP vide its letter No. BPRD/BA&CPD/638/436708/2023 dated March 7, 2023 has reduced the minimum requirement to 2.5% up till March 2024 which was 3% as per BPRD circular No.6 dated August 15, 2013. The bank has a leverage ratio of 3.88% in the year ended December 31, 2024, (2023: 3.12%) and Tier-1 capital of Rs.353,930 Millions (2023: 283,307).

The SBP's regulatory capital as managed by the Bank is analysed into following tiers:

1. Tier 1 Capital (going-concern capital)
- Common Equity Tier 1
- Additional Tier 1

Tier I capital, which comprises highest quality capital element and include fully paid up capital, balance in share premium account, reserve for issue of bonus shares, general reserves and un-appropriate profits (net of accumulated losses, if any).
2. Tier 2 Capital (gone-concern capital)
Tier II capital, which includes general reserve for loan losses, revaluation reserve, exchange translation reserve and subordinated debt.

Basel III capital rules requires bank to make certain deductions from the capital before arriving at the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR).

Risk weighted assets are measured according to the nature and reflect an estimate of credit, market and other risks associated with each asset and counterparty, taking into account any eligible collateral or guarantees. A similar treatment is adopted for off-balance sheet exposures, with some adjustments to reflect more contingent nature of potential losses.

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

The Bank's policy is to maintain strong capital base so as to maintain, investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The adequacy of the Bank's capital is monitored using, among other measures, the rules and ratios established by the SBP. The ratios compare the amount of eligible capital with the total of risk-weighted assets. The Bank monitors and reports its capital ratio under the SBP rules, which ultimately determines the regulatory capital, required to be maintained by Banks and DFIs. The paid-up capital of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2024 stood at Rs. 21,275 million (2023 : Rs. 21,275 million) and is in compliance with the SBP requirement for the said period. In addition the Bank has maintained minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 27.80% (2023: 25.47%). There have been no material changes in the Bank's management of capital during the year.

# 48 RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk Management is a logical and/or systematic method to identify, measure, monitor and control the risks involved in any activity or process. Risk is inherent in all our business activities. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions/ penalties, and damage to our reputation; each of which may adversely impact on our ability to execute our business strategies. The Bank has taken a comprehensive approach towards risk management with a well-defined Risk Management Strategy/ Policy with clear objectives and deliverables through multi-pronged risk management processes. In the Bank, it is ensured that the risk management framework along with internal controls are adequate and effective in accurately identifying, assessing or addressing risks faced by the Bank.

The Bank applies the Basel framework as a cornerstone of its risk management framework, capital and liquidity strategy. The Bank maintains a strong capital, funding and liquidity position in line with its ongoing commitment to maintain balance sheet strength. The strength of risk profile management of the Bank stands at the following pillars:

- Identification and assessment of significant material risks
- Overseeing and managing the risk profile of the Bank within the context of the risk appetite
- Optimize risk/ return decisions by aligning them to business objective of achieving sustainable optimum growth.

To support Risk Management Group (RMG’s) activities, a strong data management mechanism is also in place to collect and consolidate exposure wise information for various risk related analysis and reviews. The mechanism also helps in identification of e-CIB related information, periodic reviews, generation of reports and highlighting inconsistencies and errors, and issuing instructions to the relevant data entry points for rectification.

The Bank is cognizant of importance of Environmental & Social Risk Management (E&SRM). The Green Banking Office (GBO) within Corporate Social Responsibility & Sustainable Development Division, Inclusive Development Group (IDG), is responsible for the development of Green Banking and Environmental & Social Risk Management (GB & ESRM) Policy and coordinates across functional areas of the Bank to oversee the implementation of GB & ESRM Policy.

## Chunk 436

# 48.1 Risk Governance Structure

The Board is responsible for ensuring active oversight of the implementation of policies and frameworks to prevent any significant financial loss or reduction in shareholder value. The Board manages its responsibility through Board Risk & Compliance Committee (BRCC) which is essentially a Board-level oversight committee that remains updated with regard to changes in the risk management activities of the Bank on behalf of the Board and is the highest risk-related policy making and supervising body for all types of risks faced by the Bank, notably credit, market, liquidity, operational, Information Security and other risks that may have material impact over the Bank’s performance. BRCC functions under its Terms of Reference (TORs) duly approved by the Board of Directors.

Risk Management Group (RMG) operates as an independent group under the supervision of Chief Risk Officer (CRO). RMG's scope and coverage has been enhanced to cater enterprise-wide risk management, credit risk management, credit administration and information security. CRO reports directly to the President with a dotted line reporting to the Board Risk & Compliance Committee (BRCC). The group is responsible for performing the functions pertaining to development and oversight of the risk framework, methodologies and other functions assigned from time to time in line with local/ international best practices and under the ambit of SBP’s regulations/ guidelines.

# 48.2 Risk Management Framework

The Bank implements a risk management framework through a 'Three Lines of Defence' model & defines clear responsibilities and accountabilities for various offices and ensures effective & independent oversight and assurance that the activities take place as intended.

---

## Chunk 439

# The First Line of Defence:

Business groups have primary responsibility for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling the risks within their areas of accountability. They are required to implement effective procedures and controls to ensure compliance with the related policy requirements, to maintain appropriate risk management skills, and to act within defined parameters as a set and approved by the Board.

---

## Chunk 440

# The Second Line of Defence:

Primarily Risk Management and the Compliance functions in the Bank act as second line of defence however other support functions also perform control activities where applicable. These functions oversee and independently challenge the effectiveness of risk management actions taken by business groups which are further evaluated at Management-level Committees.

---

## Chunk 441

# The Third Line of Defence:

Audit & Inspection Group (A&IG) provides independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve risk management functions of the Bank. A&IG helps the Bank accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes.

The following paragraphs introduce Bank’s exposures to material risks associated with its business activities and explain overall strategies and processes to manage those risks:

---

## Chunk 442

# 48.2.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk arises when a counterparty fails to repay a loan, leading to financial losses, cash flow disruptions, and increased debt recovery costs. For NBP, lending activities represent the primary source of credit risk. These activities include providing loans and advances, contingent liabilities such as letters of credit and guarantees, and engaging in other on- and off-balance sheet transactions.

The goal of credit risk management is to maintain credit risk exposure within acceptable levels, ensuring asset quality and achieving returns that align with the level of risk. By taking a proactive approach to managing credit risk, NBP not only safeguards its profitability and sustainability but also supports the stability of the financial system and efficient capital allocation. Under the supervision of the Board Risk and Compliance Committee (BRCC), the Bank has a dedicated risk management setup, headed by the Chief Risk Officer, which ensures the efficiency of credit risk assessment, measurement, review, and reporting frameworks.

Prudent lending decisions can empower people and businesses to boost the bank’s profitability and strategically guard against the risks of extending credit. The effective implementation of structured risk assessment standards, comprehensive pre-disbursement evaluation tools, and post-disbursement review systems has allowed NBP to effectively manage credit risk and mitigate losses within acceptable tolerance levels. Our risk management approach is driven by a strategic goal to maintain a robust framework, proactively identify and address risks, and facilitate sustainable business growth. The bank has in place a Risk Appetite Framework and a Credit Risk Concentration Management Framework to set limits on credit risk exposure in relation to obligors, economic groups, and industry segments.

The Risk Management function continuously evaluates the credit portfolio using detailed reports and dashboards to identify borrowers and sectors vulnerable to changes in local and global economic conditions. The Bank actively monitors account delinquencies, counterparties' financial health, prevailing economic landscape, and other relevant factors. A robust credit review mechanism and approval process, closely supervised by senior management, ensures effective oversight.

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

The Bank has actively undertaken the implementation of the IFRS 9 standard. This standard introduces a model for financial assets, mandating the recognition of impairment charges through the 'Expected Credit Loss' approach, departing from the existing 'Incurred Credit Loss' approach.

The Retail & Program Lending Division performs risk management of program-based products, encompassing Retail Banking Group (RBG), Inclusive Development Group (IDG), and Aitemaad Islamic Banking Group (AIBG). Adopting a credit cycle approach, the Division provides end-to-end credit management through various functions that includes policy and portfolio management, MIS and analytics, credit approvals, collection and recovery and quality assurance. The division also works closely with Operational Risk, Information Technology, Credit Administration, and Human Resource functions to ensure comprehensive risk management. The Divisional Head reports directly to the Chief Risk Officer (CRO).

Effective Credit Administration is very crucial for the Bank as it enables the Bank to effectively manage credit risk, maintain regulatory compliance, and ensure financial stability. CAD, in view of its critical role in post-approval credit management, is actively contributing to portfolio expansion and granting individuals and businesses access to essential funds. As a part of continuous improvement, CAD has implemented additional controls and enhanced its monitoring with the aim to have more efficient end-to-end processes whilst maintaining appropriate controls. Moreover, CAD is actively working on automation, focusing on advanced collateral management functions, control over limit functions, and effective vendor management. Once the Core Banking Application (CBA) is upgraded, it is expected to significantly bolster the Bank's position within its peer group, reinforcing its overall strength and building customer confidence.

The Bank employs the Standardized Approach within the SBP’s Basel Accord to estimate credit risk-weighted assets. This approach allows banks to incorporate external ratings of counterparties when calculating risk-weighted assets. Additionally, stress testing for credit risk is performed to evaluate the potential impact of scenarios prescribed by the regulator.

This approach allows Banks to incorporate external ratings of counterparties when calculating risk-weighted assets. Additionally, stress testing for credit risk is performed to evaluate the potential impact of scenarios prescribed by the regulator.

Particulars of the Bank's significant on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet credit risk in various sectors are analysed as follows:

---

## Chunk 445

# 48.2.1.2 External ratings

The SBP Basel III guidelines require banks to use ratings assigned by specified External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) namely Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA), VIS and Moody's, Fitch and Standard & Poor's.

The SBP through its letter number BSD/BAI-2/201/1200/2009 dated December 21, 2009 accorded approval to the Bank for use of ratings assigned by Credit Rating Agency of Bangladesh (CRAB) and Credit Rating Information and Services Limited (CRISL). The Bank uses these ECAIs to rate its exposures denominated in Bangladeshi currency on certain corporate exposures and banks incorporated in Bangladesh.

The Bank uses external ratings for the purpose of mapping risk weights as per the Basel III framework. Instances whereby an exposure is rated by two or more ratings agencies, mapping into different risk weights, instructions outlined in Regulatory guidelines on BASEL framework shall be adhered to for selection of applicable rating.

# 48.2.1.4  Collateral valuation and management

As stipulated in the SBP Basel guidelines, the Bank uses simple approach for credit risk mitigation. Under this approach the risk weighting of the collateral instrument collateralizing or partially collateralizing the exposure is substituted for the risk weighting of the counterparty.

---

## Chunk 448

# 48.2.1.5  Types of collaterals

The Bank determines the appropriate collateral for each facility based on the type of product and counterparty. In case of corporate and SME financing, fixed assets are generally taken as security for long tenure loans and current assets for working capital finance usually backed by mortgage or hypothecation. For project finance, security of the assets of the borrowers and assignment of the underlying project contracts are generally obtained. Additional security such as pledge of shares, cash collateral, TDRs, SSC/DSCs, charge on receivables may also be obtained. Moreover, in order to cover the entire exposure personal guarantees of directors / borrowers are also obtained generally by the Bank. For retail products, the security to be taken is defined in the product policy for the respective products. Housing loans and automobile loans are secured by the property and automobile being financed respectively. The Bank also offers products which are primarily based on collateral such as shares, specified securities and pledged commodities. These products are offered in line with the SBP prudential regulations and approved product policies which also deal with types of collateral, valuation and margining. The decision on the type and quantum of collateral for each transaction is taken by the credit approving authority as per the credit approval authorisation approved by the MCC under its delegation powers. For facilities provided as per approved product policies (retail products, loan against shares etc.), collateral is taken in line with the policy.

---

## Chunk 449

# 48.2.1.6  Types of eligible financial collateral

For credit risk mitigation purposes (capital adequacy purposes), the Bank considers all types of financial collaterals that are eligible under the SBP Basel III accord. This includes cash / TDRs, gold, securities issued by Government of Pakistan such as T-Bills and PIBs, National Savings Certificates, certain debt securities rated by recognised credit rating agencies, and guarantees from certain specified entities (Government of Pakistan, Banks etc.) under substitution effect of Basel.

---

## Chunk 450

# 48.2.1.7  Credit concentration risk

Credit concentration risk arises mainly due to concentration of exposures under various categories viz. industry, geography, and single/group borrower exposures. Within credit portfolio, as a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of risks, the SBP has prescribed regulatory limits on banks’ maximum exposure to single borrower, group borrowers and related parties. Moreover, in order to restrict the industry concentration risk, Bank’s Credit Risk Concentration Management Framework spells out the maximum allowable exposure that it can take on specific industry. Additionally, the Internal Rating System allows the Bank to monitor risk rating concentration of borrowers against different grades / scores ranging from 1 - 12 (1 being the best and 12 being loss category). Particulars of the Bank's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet credit risk in various sectors are analysed as follows:

---

## Chunk 451

# 48.2.1.8  Methodologies and models used for the measurement of Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD).

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal / external rating grade for subject customer. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer / facility to the watch list, or the account being restructured. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 60 days past due. When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Bank applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its financial instruments into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

---

## Chunk 452

# Stage 1 (Performing assets)

When financial instruments are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-months default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the forward looking LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

---

## Chunk 453

# Stage 2 (Underperforming assets)

When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

---

## Chunk 454

# Stage 3 (Non performing assets)

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises LTECLs for these instruments. A description of how the Bank defines credit-impaired and default is given in relevant section. The Bank uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP.

---

## Chunk 455

# Undrawn financing commitments

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. Expected draw-down is added to the EAD and the ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows of EAD if the financings are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. For revolving facilities that include both financings and an undrawn commitment, ECLs are calculated on un-drawn portion (after application of CCF) of the facility and presented within other liabilities.

---

## Chunk 456

# Guarantee and letters of credit contracts

The Bank estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven credit conversion factor (CCF) for financial guarantee and letter of credit contracts respectively. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to financial guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within other liabilities.

---

## Chunk 457

# Forward looking information

The Bank has performed historical analysis and identified the key economic variables impacting credit risk and expected credit losses for Wholesale & Retail portfolio. These economic variables and their associated impact on the PD vary by the portfolio. The rating band / DPD bucket wise PDs are computed through migration analysis using at least 5 years historical transition matrices of respective portfolio. Furthermore, a detailed regression analysis is carried out using Macro Economic variables (i.e. Average Inflation rate, GDP Growth rate and Exports were regressed against Bank's Internal Default Rates) in order to attain forward-looking PDs for each following year. In addition to the base economic scenario, the Bank also uses other possible scenarios along with scenario weightings. The number of scenarios and their attributes are reassessed at each reporting date.

---

## Chunk 458

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

For expected credit loss provisions modelled on a collective basis, a grouping of exposures is performed on the basis of shared risk characteristics, such that risk exposures within a group are homogeneous.

In its ECL models, the Bank relies on range of the following forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

- GDP growth
- Consumer price index
- Exports

The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is measured on either a 12-month (12M) or Lifetime basis depending on whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred since initial recognition or whether an asset is considered to be credit-impaired. Expected credit losses are the discounted product of the Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD), discounted at an approximation to the EIR, defined as follows:

---

## Chunk 459

# Probability of Default (PD):

The Probability of default (PD) represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation, either over the next 12 months (12M PD), or over the remaining lifetime (Lifetime PD) of the obligation.

- For corporate, commercial, and SME loan portfolios, the Bank has used a obligor risk rating (ORR) transition based approach to determine the segment wise PDs for each ORR.
- For housing, agriculture, cash and gold and advance salary, a days-past-due (“DPD”) based migration approach has been used; and these PD's for wholesale & retail portfolio are then adjusted with forward looking information to arrive at point in time (PIT) PDs;
- For other financial assets (i.e. investments, lending to financial institutions, balances with other banks etc.), historical PDs were estimated on the basis of global default Rates taken from S&P rating-wise transition matrices. These annual default Rates were converted into forward-looking PDs using the vasicek model. The forecast global macro-economic variables were derived using historical regression between global macro-economic variables and Pakistan macro-economic variables.

# Exposure at Default (EAD)

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has a legal right to call it earlier. The Bank’s product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail facilities, in which the Bank has the right to cancel and / or reduce the facilities with one day notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Bank does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the Bank’s expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the Bank’s future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

## Chunk 461

# Loss Given Default (LGD):

LGD represents an estimate of the loss incurred on a facility in the event of default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive. It is expressed as a percentage of the EAD. Bank has estimated segment wise LGDs for Corporate / Commercial, SE, ME & Agri Portfolio as well as product wise LGDs for Auto Finance, Personal Loan, Home Finance and Credit Card portfolio. The LGDs are determined using workout approach, based on vintage recovery data for the defaulted portfolio; these recoveries are then discounted back to date of default, to factor in time value of money.

The Bank has converted the estimates for segment / product wise historical LGDs (Through the cycle LGDs) into forward looking point in time LGDs, through use of term structure of Point in time Pds.

# ECL Principles, Grouping and Calculations

The ECL is determined by projecting the PD, LGD and EAD for each future repayment date and for each individual exposure. These three components are multiplied together, effectively calculating an ECL for each.

future repayment date, which is then discounted back to the reporting date and summed. The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective interest rate (at reporting date), the Bank uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date). When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three scenarios (a base, best and a worst case). Each of these scenario's is based on different macro-economic forecasts and is associated with different set of PDs & LGD. Furthermore, to mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The Bank considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics:

- History of legal certainty & enforceability
- History of recovery

The Bank's management has only considered cash, gold & gold ornaments, liquid securities, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals, while calculating EADs. Furthermore, The credit exposure (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

## Chunk 463

# Impact on Regulatory Capital:

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the Banks, which has reduced their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has permitted Banks to opt for transitional arrangement for the ECL impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the 'Application Instructions' issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement.

Accordingly, Bank has opted for transition arrangement to phase in ECL impact and below tabulated is the impact on key ratios, had the transitional arrangement not applied.

|Key Ratios|With Transitional arrangement|Without Transitional arrangement|
|---|---|---|
|Total Capital to total RWA (CAR)|27.80%|26.13%|
|Leverage Ratio|3.88%|3.65%|

# 48.2.1.10 ECL Modeling and staging criteria/ Significant increase in ECLs

Significant increase in credit risk (SICR): A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument compared to the risk of default expected at the time of initial recognition. The Bank uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR including, inter alia, the deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR), in line with Bank's internally approved grid outlining specific notches downgrade for each ORR / external rating, payments being past due by 60 days, and other qualitative factors (such as watchlisting or restructuring of account).

# 48.2.1.11 Loans and advances definitions and methodologies of categorisation, credit loss allowance stages and movements between stages

Backward Transition: In line with Bank's IFRS 9 Policy and Regulatory guidelines, financial assets shall be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they fulfill the criteria outlined in the Prudential Regulations (PR) issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Similarly, financial assets classified under Stage 2 shall be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) no longer exist. However, a minimum period of three months from the initial downgrade is mandatory before any facility can be moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to transition from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it must meet the declassification requirements specified in the relevant Prudential Regulations. An exposure cannot be directly upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1; instead, it must first transition to Stage 2 and subsequently complete a cooling-off period of three months before being reclassified to Stage 1.

# 48.2.2 Market risk

Market Risk is the value of on and off-balance sheet positions of a financial institution that are adversely affected by movements in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads and/or commodity prices resulting in a loss to earnings and capital.

The Bank’s market risk is managed through Market & Liquidity Risk Management Policy duly approved by the Board. The Bank has in-place market risk limits to manage risks within the Bank's approved risk appetite.

The Standardized Approach is used to calculate capital charge for market risk as per Basel framework. Stress testing for interest sensitive, equity, and FX exposures is carried out regularly to estimate the impact on the capital of the Bank.

In addition to the regulatory requirements, Bank has devised proprietary stress testing scenarios which are periodically performed to assess the impact on capital of the Bank for Internal Capital Adequacy and Assessment Process (ICAAP). Limits/ zones and management action triggers/ plans corresponding to various ratios/ limits/ thresholds are defined in the Market & Liquidity Risk Policy. Appropriate segregation of duties exists between the front, middle, and back office functions.

# 48.2.2.4 Yield / Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)-Basel II Specific

Interest rate risk arises due to adverse movements in yield curve that is being monitored by ALCO with an objective to manage the potential adverse impact on the profitability of the Bank. This may arise due to volatility in market interest rates and any mismatch/ gaps in the amount of financial assets/ liabilities in different maturity time bands. The sources of IRR are based on following sub-risks.

- Re-pricing risk; arising from changes to the overall level of interest rates and inherent mismatches in the re-pricing term of banking book items.
- Yield curve risk; arising from a change in the relative level of interest rates for different tenors and changes in the slope or shape of the yield curve.
- Basis risk; arising from differences between the actual and expected interest margins on Banking book items over the implied cost of funds of those items.

# 48.2.3    Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. This definition includes legal risk but excludes strategic and reputational risks. For effective implementation, the Bank has a comprehensive Operational Risk Management Policy Framework (ORMPF) and procedures. These provide guidance for setting up operational risk strategy of the Bank, selection and adoption of risk and loss measurement tools, reporting, and establishment of operational risk management process.

Operational risks are core components of doing business arising from the day-to-day operational activities of the Bank including launching of new products and services. The Bank realizes that operational risks cannot be fully mitigated, it therefore determines an appropriate balance between accepting potential losses and related costs of mitigation.

Further, the Bank has adopted an Operational Risk Management Policy Framework and Operational Risk Appetite duly approved by the Board. Furthermore, the Bank has rolled-out operational risk events (OREs) collection mechanism whereby field functionaries and Groups/Divisions at head office are responsible to report operational losses under their jurisdictions on immediate basis. OREs are reviewed and appropriate corrective measures are taken on an ongoing basis. Risk Evaluation exercise is carried out for new products, processes and systems as per the ORM procedures.

The Bank also conducts root cause analysis of major OREs covering key control lapses and accordingly suggests mitigating actions. As per regulatory framework, the Bank calculates capital charge for its operational risk using Basic Indicator Approach (BIA).

Moreover, the Bank closely monitored overall operational environment and undertakes required actions to ensure the safety and security of the Bank's staff and its assets. The Bank takes measures to ensure continuously improve customer service levels and resolve related complaints to meet the expectations of its stakeholders.

The Bank's operations stays highly resilient and the Bank deploys all necessary measures for the health and safety of its employees to prevent them from any unwarranted situation.

# 48.2.4 Information Security Risk

Management of Information Security risk is given due importance, considering extensive customer base and increasing digital footprint of the Bank. A mechanism has been devised for upscaling technology infrastructure and related channels from information security standpoint. Further, due to evolving cyber threat landscape, the Bank has taken appropriate actions to monitor and respond to cybersecurity risks and adopted a heightened state of cybersecurity. We are living in a highly technologically dependent environment, where most of the business functions are performed with information technology for storing, processing and sharing of information. The information “assets” that are being used to store, process and transmit the information face various types of threats. If threats materialize and are able to exploit the vulnerabilities (weaknesses) present in these information assets, the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information get compromised and/or may result in a breakdown of IT assets. In order to mitigate the risks, certain controls and countermeasures need to be assessed and implemented. The Bank has devised a governance mechanism to manage related risks through development of policies & frameworks, and deployed security tools to ensure adequate implementation of internal controls and monitoring of security threats within technology infrastructure.

As a first line of defense, the Business groups have primary responsibility for identifying, measuring, and controlling the risks within their areas of accountability. Information Security Division (ISD) is the second line of defense against cyber risks. Therefore, the Bank regularly assesses the information security controls and undertakes employees’ awareness and training. The Bank works with its key technology partners to ensure that potentially vulnerable systems are identified and appropriate fixes & controls are implemented to secure the systems. The Bank is actively communicating with its customers on interacting with the Bank in a secure manner through its full suite of channels including online and digital banking.

Over the last two years, the Bank has taken various initiatives to uplift its cyber security controls. Management is cognizant of the fact that cyber security is a top priority, and the Bank is taking appropriate steps to monitor and respond to it. The Information Security Division (ISD) works under the supervision of Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Numerous steps have been taken by the Bank to identify cyber security weaknesses of systems & infrastructure.

# 48.2.5 Enterprise-wide Risk

The Bank has a Board approved Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework in place. The ERM framework is a holistic approach starting from strategy setting, capital and financial planning to managing, monitoring, and reporting of risks inherent in the day-to-day business of the Bank. It documents the risk management structure and processes driven by the Bank’s board of directors, management, and other personnel. All this provides reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the Bank’s strategic objectives.

In addition to the Pillar I risks, the Bank has a structure to identify other Pillar II material risks on a periodic basis. The Bank has in place an Internal Capital Adequacy & Assessment Process (ICAAP) to identify and quantify material risks, including Pillar II risks, and continually re-assess the adequacy of the capital buffer and risk appetite, which is set periodically in order to build a solid platform for business growth.

In accordance with the regulatory requirements for Domestic Systematically Important Banks (D-SIBs), the Bank has put in place a Recovery Plan to prepare the Bank to act promptly and efficiently in the event of stress situations that may threaten the financial and operational strength and viability of a Bank and pose a risk on Bank’s ability to remain a going concern. Moreover, risks that are material and arise within the Bank or due to behaviour of the country’s market and economic conditions, whether in isolation or in combination are addressed in the Bank-wide Recovery Plan.

Bank’s Stress-testing framework comprises of tools to deliver a timely assessment of the resilience of the Bank’s capital under stressed conditions to the senior management. It ranges from simple sensitivity analysis to sophisticated stress testing methods to capture the abnormal movement of market and economic indicators and to translate such scenarios into projections of Bank’s profitability, liquidity and capital planning.

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

This framework paves the way to a quantitative, forward-looking assessment of capital adequacy (movement/
level of Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of the Bank) to provide an indication of how much capital might be
needed to absorb any expected and any unforeseen losses. It helps in identifying potential vulnerabilities within
the Bank and assessing solvency by applying plausible/ past adverse scenarios under extreme conditions.

## Chunk 490

# 48.2.6 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk of loss to a Bank arising from its inability to meet obligations as they fall due or to fund
assets, without incurring unacceptable costs or losses. More simply, liquidity risk is the possibility that a bank
will be unable to meet its financial commitment to a customer, creditor, or investor when due, in a timely and
cost-effective manner.

To mitigate this risk, the Bank has arranged diversified funding sources, manages specific assets with liquidity
in mind and monitors liquidity position on daily basis. In addition, the Bank maintains statutory deposits with
central Banks inside and outside Pakistan. The purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that there are
sufficient cash flows to meet all of the Bank's liabilities when due, under both normal and stress conditions
without incurring unacceptable losses, as well as to capitalize on opportunities for business expansion and
profitability. This includes the Bank's ability to meet deposit withdrawals either on demand or at contractual
maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature and to make new loans and investments, as opportunities arise.

The Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) is responsible for ensuring that the Bank has adequate liquidity and
monitors liquidity gaps, to execute this responsibility. Mandatory as well as optional stress testing and ratio
based liquidity assessments are performed to proactively identify and manage liquidity position, needs/
requirements. The Bank has put in place various limits/ ratios, triggers and related management actions in
place to monitor and mitigate liquidity risk. The Bank calculates and monitors, on regular basis, Basel-III
Liquidity standards (includes LCR, NSFR and LMTs), liquidity ratios as per SBP parameters besides other
internal liquidity measures.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# 48.2.7 Derivative risk

A derivative is a contract that derives its value from the performance of an underlying asset which can be an index, interest rate, commodity price, security price, FX rate etc. Derivatives include forwards, futures, swaps, options etc. In Pakistan, futures and forwards are most commonly traded derivatives.

Currently, the Bank is not an active participant in the Pakistan derivatives market as it does not hold an Authorized Derivative Dealer (ADD) license to perform derivative transactions. Once acquired, the Bank will carry out transactions that are permitted under the Financial Derivatives Business Regulations issued by SBP, which may include Interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, foreign currency options, etc.

Moreover, the Bank may also offer other over the counter derivative products to satisfy customer requirements, specific approval of which will be sought from the SBP on a transaction by transaction basis.

# 11 Pool Management

NBP-AIBG has managed following pools for profit and loss distribution.

a) General depositor pool

The General pool consists of all other remunerative deposits. NBP Aitemaad (the Mudarib) accept deposits on the basis of Mudaraba from depositors (Rabbulmaal). The net return on the pool is arrived at after deduction of direct costs from the gross return earned on the pool. The entire net return after paying equity share to Mudarib is considered as distributable profit of the pool.

# b) Special depositor pools (Total 253 during the period and 33 as at Dec 31, 2024)

Special pool(s) are created where the customers desire to invest in high yield assets. These pool(s) rates are higher than the general pool depending on the assets. In case of loss in special pool, the loss will be borne by the special pool members. The net return on the pool is arrived at after deduction of direct costs from the gross return earned on the pool. From the net return, and after allocation of share of profit to commingled equity, profit is paid to the Mudarib in the ratio of the Mudarib’s equity in the pool to the total pool. The balance represents the distributable profit.

# c) Equity pool

Equity pools include AIBG's fund and current account deposits. The equity pool may have constructive liquidation every month and risk associated with assets of pool includes operational, market, equity, return and Shariah.

---

## Chunk 531

# Key features and risk & reward characteristics

Deposits are accepted from customers on the basis of Qard (current accounts) and Mudarabah (Saving and term deposits). No profit or loss is passed on to current account depositors.

For deposits accepted on Mudarabah basis from depositors (Rab ul Maal) the Bank acts as Manager (Mudarib) and invests the funds in the Shariah Compliant modes of financings. Rab ul Maal share is distributed among depositors according to weightages declared for a month before start of the period.

In case of loss in a pool during the profit calculation period, the loss is distributed among the depositors (remunerative) according to their ratio of investment.

For all pools, the Mudarib’s share is deducted from the distributable profit to calculate the profit to be allocated to depositors. The allocation of the profit to various deposit categories is determined by the amount invested in that category relative to the total pool, as well as by the weightage assigned to the various deposit categories.

The assets, liabilities, equities, income and expenses are segregated for each of the pool. No pool investment is intermingled with each other. The risk associated with each pool is thus equally distributed among the pools.

Profit of the pools has been distributed between Mudarib and Rab-ul-Mall by using preagreed profit sharing ratios. The share of Rab-ul-Mall's profit has been distributed among different customers using the various weightages assigned to the different categories of the pool. No provision against any non performing asset of the pool is passed on to the pool except on the actual loss / write off of such non performing asset.

Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the Directors’ Review together with consolidated financial statement of National Bank of Pakistan “the Bank” and its group companies for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Consolidated after-tax profit for the year ended December 31, 2024, amounted to PKR 26.503 Bn, being 50.3% lower than PKR 53.321 Bn for the same period last year. During the year, the subsidiary companies contributed PKR 0.984 Bn (December 31, 2023: PKR 1.174 Bn) in Group profitability, whereas the associates contributed share of profit of PKR 0.479 Bn (December 31, 2023: PKR 0.245 Bn). A share of profit of PKR 0.605 Bn (December 31, 2023: PKR 1.226 Bn) was however recorded on account of UNBL, a UK based Joint Venture in which NBP had 45% shareholding. During the period, the bank has divested NBP’s share of 45% in UNBL to Bestway group. Accordingly, consolidated EPS per share recorded at PKR 12.21 for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to EPS of PKR 24.96 for the same period last year.

# Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

# Opinion

We have audited the annexed consolidated financial statements of National Bank of Pakistan and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2024, and the consolidated statement of profit and loss account, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy information and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2024, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan.

---

## Chunk 538

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Pakistan. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants as adopted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (the Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

|S.No.|Key Audit Matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|---|---|---|
|1|Credit loss allowance against advances (Refer notes 5.27, 12.4 and 35 to the consolidated financial statements)|The Group records credit loss allowance against advances in Pakistan operations in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. Under IFRS 9, the Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the Expected Credit Losses ('ECL') associated with all advances and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments. A lifetime ECL is recorded on advances in which there have been Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) from the date of initial recognition and on advances which are credit impaired as on the reporting date. A 12 months ECL is recorded for advances which do not meet the criteria for SICR or "credit impaired" as at the reporting date. To assess whether there is a significant increase in the credit risk, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the advances as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. Both lifetime and 12 months ECL are calculated at facility level. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to the consolidated statement of profit and loss account and is decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. The Group records charge for Stage 3 exposures based on the higher of provision under Prudential Regulations or ECL under IFRS 9, as per the instructions of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). This assessment is conducted at the facility level for corporate, commercial, and SME loan portfolios, and at a segment level for the retail portfolio. If one facility of a counterparty becomes 90+ days past due (DPD) or is otherwise defined as impaired under Prudential Regulations, all other facilities of that counterparty are classified as Stage 3. The measurement of ECL involves evaluating a range of possible outcomes, considering the time value of money, and incorporating reasonable and supportable information available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions. Provisions pertaining to overseas advances are made in accordance with the requirements of regulatory authorities of the respective countries.|

As at December 31, 2024, the Group holds a credit loss allowance including general provision of Rs. 268,075.412 million against advances. The determination of credit loss allowance against advances based on the above criteria remains a significant area of judgment and estimation. Because of the significance of the impact of these judgments / estimations and the materiality of advances relative to the overall consolidated financial statements of the Group, we considered this area as a key audit matter.|• assessed the reasonableness of the forward-looking assumptions used by the management in calculation of ECL; and • assessed the relevant disclosures made in the consolidated financial statements to determine whether these are complied with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. We issued instructions to auditors of those overseas branches which were selected for audit, highlighting ‘Credit loss allowance against financial assets and off-balance items’ as a significant risk. The auditors of those branches performed audit procedures to check compliance with regulatory requirements and reported the results thereof to us. We, as auditors of the Group, evaluated the work performed by the component auditors and the results thereof.|
|2|Pension benefits liability (Refer notes 22, 26.3.3.1, 33.2 and 41.4 to the consolidated financial statements) The Group operates an approved funded pension scheme for its eligible employees. The valuation for pension benefits is carried out annually by the actuary appointed by the management of the Group using the projected unit cost method. A number of the Group’s employees had filed writ petitions before the Lahore High Court and Peshawar High Court with respect to their pensionary benefits in prior years. The Supreme Court of Pakistan (SCP) in September 2017 after hearing the arguments of both parties decided the case against the Group. The Group had subsequently filed review petitions against the judgement of the SCP. During the year, the SCP has by its order dated March 27, 2024 dismissed all the civil review petitions filed by the Group, as a result of which the Supreme Court’s decision dated September 25, 2017 in respect of the pension litigation, has now attained finality. Accordingly, and in compliance of the judgement, the Group has made payments to majority of petitioners as well as non-petitioners. In addition, the SCP has also directed the Group to pay arrears of any government increases in pension to the petitioners. As a result of the above decision, the management has recognised a past service cost of Rs. 57,550 million based on the valuation carried out by the management’s actuary in the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2024. The net|Our audit procedures to verify pension benefits liability included, amongst others, the following: • Reviewed the Supreme Court's order and checked the Group’s compliance with the judgment, including payments made to pensioners on a test basis; • Reviewed minutes of the meeting of the Board of Directors for discussions held with respect to the pension litigation and liability; • Obtained and reviewed the management expert’s actuarial report supporting the calculation of pension obligations and evaluated key actuarial assumptions; • Engaged an independent actuarial expert to assess the reasonableness of the pension liability determined by the management’s actuary along with the related assumptions; and • Evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures made in the consolidated financial statements to ensure compliance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan.|

| |Present value of the Group’s obligation against pension scheme as at December 31, 2024, amounted to Rs. 75,638 million. The determination of pension benefits liability as per the order of the SCP required certain estimates and judgments to be made including actuarial assumptions. The calculation of pension benefits remains an area of significant estimate and judgment.

# Information Other than the Consolidated and Unconsolidated Financial Statements and Auditors’ Reports Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements and our auditors’ reports thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Chunk 544

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

## Chunk 545

# Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partners on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report are Shahbaz Akbar and Zulfikar Ali Causer on behalf of A. F. Ferguson & Co., Chartered Accountants and BDO Ebrahim & Co., Chartered Accountants respectively.

Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses as well as in the disclosure of contingent liabilities. It also requires management to exercise judgment in application of its accounting policies. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other.

---

## Chunk 572

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

Factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and in future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

---

## Chunk 573

# a) Credit Allowance against non-performing loans and advances

The Bank regularly reviews its loan portfolio to assess the amount of non-performing loans and determine the provisions required there against at each reporting date. In assessing this requirement, various factors including the days past dues, delinquency in the account, financial position and future business / financial plan of the borrower, value of collateral held and requirements of SBP Prudential Regulations are considered. Credit loss allowances are maintained at the higher of ECL under IFRS 9 or the prudential regulation R-8. The Bank also considers the impact of Forced Sale Value (FSV) of collaterals when determining the amount of provisions. However, no benefit of FSV of non-liquid collateral has been taken into account during the year in calculating the provisioning amount. General provisions for loan losses for overseas branches are made as per the requirements of the respective central banks.

# b) Fair value of derivatives

The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant interest and exchange rates over the term of the contract.

---

## Chunk 574

# c) Impairment of FVOCI investments

Impairment in respect of unquoted shares is calculated with reference to break-up value. Break-up value is calculated with reference to the net assets of the Investee Company as per the latest available audited financial statements. Provision and ECL for unquoted debt securities is calculated as per SBP's Prudential Regulations and IFRS-9 respectively. A financial instrument that is not credit-impaired on initial recognition is classified in 'Stage 1' and has its credit risk continuously monitored by the Bank. If a significant increase in credit risk ('SICR') since initial recognition is identified, the financial instrument is moved to 'Stage 2' but is not yet deemed to be credit-impaired. If the financial instrument is credit-impaired, the financial instrument is then moved to 'Stage 3' and impairment ECL of stage 3 impairment of FVOCI quoted TFCs, PTC, Ijarah Sukuks & Government Bonds is recognized in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations and other directives issued by SBP as per subjective and objective criteria of Prudential Regulations after taking into account of FSV benefit under Prudential Regulations and IFRS-9.

## Chunk 575

# d) Amortised Cost investments

The Group follows the guidance provided in the SBP circulars and IFRS 9 on classifying non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity as Amortised Cost. In making this judgment, the Group evaluates its intention and ability to hold such investments till maturity.

---

## Chunk 576

# e) Income taxes

In making the estimates for current and deferred taxes, the management looks at the income tax law and the decisions of appellate authorities on certain issues in the past. There are certain matters where the Group’s view differs with the view taken by the income tax department and such amounts are shown as contingent liability.

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# f) Property and Equipment, Non-Banking asset and intangible assets, revaluation, depreciation and amortisation

In making estimates of the depreciation / amortization method, the management uses method which reflects the pattern in which economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Group. The method applied is reviewed at each financial year end and if there is a change in the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the assets, the method is changed to reflect the change in pattern.

The Group also revalues its properties on a periodic basis. Such revaluations are carried out by independent valuer and involves estimates / assumptions and various market factors and conditions.

---

## Chunk 578

# g) Defined benefit plans including pension expense

The liabilities for employees' benefits plans are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations involve assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases, future inflation rates and future pension increases as disclosed in note 41. Due to the long term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.

# h) Provision against contingencies

Provision against contingencies is determined based on the management judgement regarding the probability of future outflows of resources embodying economic benefits to settle an obligation arising from past events.

---

## Chunk 579

# i) Lease liability against right of use assets

The group applies judgement to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the group is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized.

Moreover, management exercises judgement in establishing the discount rate for new leases, utilizing the incremental borrowing rate as a benchmark.

---

## Chunk 580

# j) Classification of financial assets and liabilities

The classification of financial asset is determined through solely payment and principal (SPPI) criteria and business model of the group. The group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

'The financial liabilities are being carried at amortised cost except for derivatives which are being measured at FVTPL.

## Chunk 581

# k) Contingent assets and contingent liabilities

Contingent assets are not recognised, and are also not disclosed unless an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognised but are disclosed unless the probability of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits are remote. The group uses estimates in determining the probability of inflow or outflow of economic benefits.

## Chunk 582

# l) Impairment of non-financial assets

The carrying amount of the assets are reviewed at each Statement of Financial Position date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the relevant asset is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.

## Chunk 584

# 4.1 Business Combination

Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit and loss account as incurred.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit and loss account as a bargain purchase gain.

Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the Group's net assets in the event of liquidation is measured at fair value at the date of the acquisition.

When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date when the Group obtains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 585

# 4.2 Goodwill

Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the subsidiary company.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units (or entities of cash-generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

---

## Chunk 586

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit and loss account. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods. On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

# 4.3 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks and call money lendings, less call borrowings and overdrawn nostro accounts having original maturity of three months or less.

## Chunk 588

# 4.5 Repurchase and resale agreements

Securities sold with a simultaneous commitment to repurchase at a specified future date (repos) continue to be recognised in the statement of financial position and are measured in accordance with accounting policies for investment securities. The counterparty liability for amounts received under these agreements is included in borrowings. The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as mark-up / return / interest expense and accrued over the life of the repo agreement using effective yield method.

Securities purchased with a corresponding commitment to resell at a specified future date (reverse repos) are not recognised in the statement of financial position, as the Bank does not obtain control over the securities. Amounts paid under these agreements are included in lendings to financial institutions. The difference between purchase and resale price is treated as mark-up / return / interest income and accrued over the life of the reverse repo agreement using effective yield method.

---

## Chunk 589

# 4.6 Derivative financial instruments

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the dates on which the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value using appropriate valuation techniques. All derivative financial instruments are carried as assets when fair value is positive and liabilities when fair value is negative. Any change in the fair value of derivative instruments during the year is taken to the profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 590

# 4.7 Financial instruments

All financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised at the time when the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset is derecognised where (a) the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or (b) the Bank has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; and either (i) the Bank has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (ii) the Bank has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risk and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the financial assets and financial liabilities is taken to profit and loss account.

Under Murabaha financing, funds disbursed for the purchase of goods are recorded as advance against Murabaha finance and the financing is recorded at the deferred sale price. Goods purchased but remaining unsold at the statement of financial position date are recorded as inventories.

Assets given on Ijarah are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Ijarah assets are depreciated on a reducing balance basis over the term of the Ijarah after taking into account the estimated residual value. Impairment of Ijarah assets is recognised in line with the Prudential Regulations or upon the occurrence of an impairment event which indicates that the carrying value of the Ijarah asset may exceed its recoverable amount.

In Running Musharakah, the Bank and the customer enter into a Musharakah agreement where the Bank agrees to finance the operating activities of the customer's business and share in the profit or loss in proportion to an agreed ratio at an agreed frequency.

# 6. Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)

# 6.1 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

As per SBP BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9 is applicable on groups with effect from January 01, 2024. IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of accounting for financial liabilities. To determine appropriate classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments, to be assessed based on combination of the entity's business model for managing the assets and the instruments' contractual cash flow characteristics. The adoption of IFRS 9 has also fundamentally changed the impairment method of financial assets with a forward-looking Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach.

The SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 dated January 22, 2025 (Letters) has made certain amendments and clarified the timelines of some of the SBP's IFRS 9 Application Instructions to address the matters raised by the groups to ensure compliance by the timelines. The Letters have provided clarifications / relaxations on measurement of unquoted equity securities, modification accounting, maintenance of general provisions over and above ECL, accounting methodology for Islamic grouping Institutions and treatment of charity. Accordingly, the group has adopted the treatment as instructed in the aforementioned Letters in these consolidated financial statements. In addition, the SBP in a separate instruction SBPHOK-BPRD-RPD-NBP-821909 dated January 22, 2025 has allowed extension for application of Effective Interest Rate up to December 31, 2025.

On application of IFRS 9, certain accounting policies have been revised to comply with the requirements of IFRS 9. The revised accounting policies have been disclosed in their respective policy notes in these consolidated financial statements.

The SBP has directed the groups through its BPRD Circular Letter No.1 dated January 22, 2025 to disclose the impact of IFRS 9 on revenue recognition from Islamic Operations which is as follows: Had IFRS 9 been adopted in its entirety for revenue recognition from Islamic operations profit / return earned on Islamic financing and related assets in consolidated statement of profit and loss account for the year ended December 31, 2024 would have been higher by Rs. 135 million and taxation would have been higher by Rs 73 million. Further, an unappropriated profit in consolidated statement of changes in equity would have been higher by Rs 62 million.

# Application to the group's financial assets

Debt based financial assets held by the group include: Advances, lending to financial institutions, investment in Federal Government securities, corporate bonds and other private sukuks, cash and balances with treasury groups, balances with other groups, and other financial assets.

a) These are measured at amortised cost if these assets meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL):

## Chunk 626

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

- the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and

- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

The group’s business model for these financial assets can still be held to collect (HTC) even when sales of these financial assets occur. However, if more than an infrequent number of sales of significant value are made, the group assesses whether and how the sales are consistent with the HTC objective.

b) Debt based financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) only if these meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as FVTPL:

- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and

- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

c) Debt based financial assets if these are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL.

In addition, on initial recognition, the group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI or at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

The group performed a detailed analysis of its business models for managing financial assets and analysis of their contractual cash flows characteristics.

# 6.2 Classification

Financial assets

Under IFRS 9, existing categories of financial assets: Held for trading (HFT), Available for sale (AFS), Held to maturity (HTM) and loans and receivables have been replaced by:

- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss account (FVTPL)
- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- Financial assets at amortised cost

Financial liabilities

Under IFRS 9, the accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus financial liabilities are being carried at amortised cost except for derivatives which are being measured at FVTPL.

## Chunk 631

# 6.2.1 Business model:

The group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The group's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the group's key management personnel;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the group’s assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the group's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:

1. Hold to Collect (HTC) business model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash
2. Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S) business model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
3. Other business models: Resulting in classification of financial assets as FVTPL

# 6.2.2 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest / profit (SPPI)

As a second step of its classification process, the group assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. ‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium / discount). The most significant elements of interest / profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the group applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as, but not limited to, the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest / profit rate is set. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL.

## Chunk 633

# 6.2.3 Application to the group's financial assets

# Debt based financial assets

Debt based financial assets held by the group include: advances, lending to financial institutions, investment in federal government securities, corporate bonds and other private sukuks, cash and balances with treasury groups, balances with other groups, and other financial assets.

1. These are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as FVTPL:
- the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

The group’s business model for these financial assets can still be HTC even when sales of these financial assets occur. However, if more than an infrequent number of sales of significant value are made, the group assesses whether and how the sales are consistent with the HTC objective.
2. Debt based financial assets are measured at FVOCI only if these meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as FVTPL:
- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.
3. Debt based financial assets if these are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

# Equity instruments

Equity instruments are instruments that meet the definition of equity from the issuer's perspective; that is, instruments that do not contain a contractual obligation to pay and that evidence a residual share in the issuer's net assets. The group measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, except where the group's management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. The group's policy is to designate equity investments as FVOCI when those investments are held for purposes other than for trading. When this election is used, fair value gains and

Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return on such investments, continue to be recognised in the profit and loss account as income when the group's right to receive payments is established.

IFRS 9 has removed the requirement for impairment assessments on equity investments. However, under BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024, dated July 29, 2024, groups may continue to measure unquoted equity securities at the lower of cost or break-up value until December 31, 2024. Starting January 1, 2025, groups will be required to measure unquoted equity securities at fair value, as mandated by the IFRS 9 application guidelines. For unquoted securities where the break-up value is lower than the cost, the difference has been classified as a loss and charged to the profit and loss account.

Gains and losses on equity instruments at FVTPL are included in the ‘Gain on sales of securities’ line in the profit and loss account.

# 6.2.4 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the group purchases or sells the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like advances, lending to financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account or financial institutions. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased.

## Chunk 637

# a) Amortised cost (AC)

Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in the consolidated condensed annual statement of profit and loss account. Interest income / profit / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in the consolidated condensed annual statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the consolidated financial statement of profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 638

# b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for debt based financial assets in the consolidated condensed annual statement of profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the consolidated financial statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of debt based financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the consolidated condensed annual statement of profit and loss account. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is transferred from surplus / deficit to unappropriated profit.

---

## Chunk 639

# c) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost will be directly recorded in the consolidated condensed annual statement of profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in the consolidated condensed annual statement of profit and loss account. Interest / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the consolidated financial statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the consolidated condensed annual statement of profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

# 6.2.5 Derecognition

Financial assets

The group derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:
- substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred; or
- the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

The group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its consolidated condensed annual statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

Financial liabilities

The group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the consolidated financial statement of profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 641

# 6.2.6 Modification

The group sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of financing to its customers. The group assesses whether the modified terms result in the financial asset being significantly modified and therefore derecognised. When the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified and the renegotiation or modification does not result in the derecognition of that financial asset in accordance with IFRS 9, the group recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset and shall recognise a modification gain or loss in consolidated statement of profit and loss account. The gross carrying amount of the financial asset is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (or credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets). Any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

---

## Chunk 642

# 6.3 Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with all advances and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The group recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money; and
- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

---

## Chunk 643

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

The group has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The group considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject customer. The group also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the group considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 60 days past due.

When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the group applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. Based on the above process, the group groups its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3, as described below:

---

## Chunk 644

# Stage 1:

When financial instruments are first recognised, the group recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The group calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

---

## Chunk 645

# Stage 2:

When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the group records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

# Stage 3:

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the group recognises the LTECLs for these instruments. The group uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP.

---

## Chunk 646

# Undrawn financing commitments

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the group estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the financings is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. For revolving facilities that include both a financings and an undrawn commitment, ECLs are calculated on un-drawn portion of the facility and presented within other liabilities.

---

## Chunk 647

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# Guarantee and letters of credit contracts

The group estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven and internally developed credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit contracts respectively. The calculation is made using a probability weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within other liabilities.

# The calculation of ECLs

The group calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash flows, discounted at an approximation to the EIR.

---

## Chunk 648

# The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:

# PD

The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the group’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12).

Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the group has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the last 7 years. PDs for Non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.

---

## Chunk 649

# EAD

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest / profit from missed payments. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the group has a legal right to call it earlier. The group's product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail facilities, in which the group has the right to cancel and / or reduce the facilities with one day notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the group does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the group expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the group future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

---

## Chunk 650

# LGD

The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD.

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective interest rate (at reporting date), the group uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date). Effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the group seeks to use collateral, where possible. The group considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics:

- History of legal certainty and enforceability
- History of enforceability and recovery

---

## Chunk 651

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

When estimating the ECLs, the group considers three scenarios (a base case, a best case, a worst case). Each of these is associated with different PDs.

The group's management has only considered cash, liquid securities, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals, while calculating EADs.

The credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level for corporate / commercial / SME loan portfolios and at segment / product basis for retail portfolio.

# Forward looking information

In its ECL models, the group relies on range of the following forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

- GDP Growth
- Consumer Price Index
- Unemployment rate

---

## Chunk 652

# Definition of default

The concept of "impairment" or "default" is critical to the implementation of IFRS 9 as it drives determination of risk parameters, i.e. PD, LGD and EAD.

As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level for corporate / commercial / SME loan portfolios and at segment / product basis for retail portfolio.

This implies that if one facility of a counterparty becomes 90+ DPD in repaying its contractual dues or as defined in PRs; all other facilities would deem to be classified as stage 3.

# Write-offs

The group's accounting policy under IFRS 9 remains the same as it was under SBP regulations / existing reporting framework.

---

## Chunk 653

# 6.4 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held-for-sale

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held-for-sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of derecognition.

Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the statement of financial position. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the statement of financial position.

# 7. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

|26.3.2 Taxation| | | | |
|- The return of income for tax year 2024 has been filed which is treated to be deemed assessment order.| | | | |
|- Honourable ATIR has passed appellate order for tax year 2005 against monitoring order and held that the proceedings are time barred. However, the order of the DCIR remanded back to the assessing officer with the instruction to proceed further if any information is already available with the tax department.| | | | |
|- Honourable ATIR has passed appellate order for tax year 2009 against monitoring order and the order passed by the DCIR has been annulled.| | | | |
|- An assessment order was issued by the ACIR for the tax year 2023. In this assessment, the tax authorities have made certain additions. The Bank has contested these additions before the Appellate Tribunal.| | | | |
|- The aggregate effect of contingencies as on Dec 31, 2024 including amount of Rs. 716 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 1,912 million) in respect of indirect tax issues, amounts to Rs. 35,160 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 34,730 million). No provision has been made against these contingencies, based on the opinion of tax consultant of the Bank, who expect favorable outcome upon decisions of pending appeals.| | | | |
|26.3.3 Contingencies in respect of employees benefits and related matters| | | | |
|The following are the details of the contingencies arising out of the various legal cases pending adjudication in respect of employees’ benefits and related matters. The Bank considers that except for Pensionary benefits note 26.3.3.1, the financial impact of other matters is impracticable to determine with sufficient reliability.| | | | |
|26.3.3.1 Pensionary benefits to retired employees| | | | |
|The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan (in Review Jurisdiction) has, by its order dated 27th March 2024, dismissed all the civil review petitions filed by NBP (CRPs No 368 to 409 etc.), as a result of which the Supreme Court decision dated 25th September 2017, in respect of the pension litigation, has now attained finality. Accordingly, and in compliance of the judgement bank has made payments to majority of petitioners as well as non-petitioners.| | | | |
|The Honorable Supreme Court has also directed NBP to pay the arrears of any government increases in pension but to only pensioners who are directly involved and are parties in the aforesaid litigation.| | | | |

things stand at the moment, an off- shoot of the said litigation is presently pending final adjudication in the Supreme Court wherein a different class of pensioners are claiming payment of government increases in pension from NBP. In this case, the Supreme Court has granted NBP annual relief and has suspended the operation of the judgment of the Lahore High Court which had directed NBP to pay such pension increases. As a result, there are now two different views of the Honorable Supreme Court vis a vis the payment of government increases in pension to the pensioners of NBP and the legal position is far from being clear or certain. However, as a matter of prudence the Bank has incorporated financial impact in these consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.

# 26.3.3.2 Regularizing the temporary hires / workers deployed by service provider companies under outsourcing arrangements

The Bank outsourced certain non-core jobs to various service provider companies after entering into contracts with them. The resources deployed by the service provider companies were their employees and the said companies have had sole administrative control over these resources. Some of these resources filed writ petitions before the High Courts and National Industrial Relations Commission (NIRC) seeking to be absorbed by the Bank in its regular service based on grounds that they were in fact employees of the Bank. Presently, there are 6 cases on appeal pending at the Supreme Court where these have been clubbed to be heard as one. The Chief Justice of Pakistan has constituted a larger bench comprising of five Judges being headed by himself for adjudication. The case is ongoing and is presently adjourned for a date to be fixed. A favorable outcome of this case is expected.

# 26.4 Foreign exchange repatriation case

While adjudicating Foreign Exchange repatriation cases of exporter namely: M/S Fateh Textile Mills Limited, the Foreign Exchange Adjudicating Court of the State Bank of Pakistan has also adjudicated penalty of Rs. 1,020 million, arbitrarily on the Bank. The Bank has filed appeals before the Appellate Board and Constitutional Petitions in the Honorable High Court of Sindh against the said judgments. The Honorable High Court has granted relief to the Bank by way of annual orders.

As advised by our counsel, NBP has also filed a Constitutional Petition challenging the constitution of the Appellate Board by the Commission and has obtained restraining order on the ground that the Appellate Board constituted by the Commission lacks legal merit in the light of Supreme Court ruling. Our counsel, Mr. Rashid Anwar, Advocate has concluded his arguments in respect of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Appellate Board constitution. However, another petition filed by another company whereby challenging the constitutionality of the Competition Act was also tagged with the petitions filed by the banks.

Based on merits of the appeals management is confident that these appeals shall be decided in favor of the Bank and therefore, no provision has been made against the impugned penalty.

# 26.5 Compliance and risk matters relating to anti-money laundering at the New York Branch

The bank fully complied with the public enforcement actions issued in February 2022 by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) and the Federal Reserve Board. It thereafter decided to close the New York branch. With approval from the NYDFS, the bank’s New York branch voluntarily surrendered its banking license to the NYSDFS in October 2024. In December 2024, the Federal Reserve Board terminated the enforcement actions issued to NBP/New York Branch in March 2016 & February 2022. The NYSDFS does not have a practice of terminating enforcement actions.

## Chunk 756

# 41.15 Significant risks associated with the staff retirement benefit schemes are as follows:

Asset volatility: The risk arises when the future earnings are lower than expectation. This risk is measured at a plan level over the obligation period of the current population. The company assets are either invested in fixed securities or cash.

Changes in bond yields: The risk arises when the actual return on plan assets is lower than expectation.

Inflation risk: The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the benefit is linked with last drawn salary. The risk arises when the actual increases are higher than expectation and impacts the liability accordingly.

Life expectancy / withdrawal rate: The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population. The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

Investment Risk: The risk arises when the actual performance of the investments is lower than expectation and thus creating a shortfall in the funding objectives.

# 44 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified under held to collect model, is based on quoted market price. Quoted Instruments classified under "held to collect" are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed-term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed-term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

---

## Chunk 765

# 44.1 Fair value of financial assets

The group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyzes financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 48 CAPITAL ADEQUACY, LEVERAGE RATIO & LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS

The Bank's objectives when managing capital, which is a broader concept than the 'equity' on the face of the statement of financial position, are:

- to comply with the capital requirements set by the regulators of the banking markets where the Bank operates;
- to safeguard the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and
- to maintain a strong capital base to support the development of its business.

The SBP has issued instructions for Basel-III Implementation vide BPRD Circular No. 06 of 2013 dated August 15, 2013. These instructions were effective from December 31, 2013 in a phased manner with full implementation intended by December 31, 2019.

Basel-III instructions comprise the following three capital standards:

1. Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR):
The MCR standard sets the nominal amount of capital banks/ DFIs are required to hold. Currently the MCR for banks and DFIs is Rs. 10 billion as prescribed by SBP.
2. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR):
The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) assesses the capital requirement based on the risks faced by the banks/ DFIs. The banks/ DFIs are required to comply with the minimum requirements as specified by the SBP on standalone as well as consolidated basis. Currently the required CAR for banks is 11.50% (plus 1.50% for NBP as D-SIB requirement).
3. Leverage Ratio:
Tier-1 Leverage Ratio of 3% is introduced in response to Basel III Accord as the third capital standard. Bank level disclosure of the leverage ratio and its components has started from December 31, 2015. However, SBP vide its letter No. BPRD/BA&CPD/638/436708/2023 dated March 7, 2023 has reduced the minimum requirement to 2.5% up till March 2024 which was 3% as per BPRD circular No.6 dated August 15, 2013. The bank has a leverage ratio of 3.83% in the year ended December 31, 2024, (2023: 3.12%) and Tier-1 capital of Rs.349,238 Millions (2023: 283,307).

The SBP's regulatory capital as managed by the Bank is analysed into following tiers:

1. Tier 1 Capital (going-concern capital)
- Common Equity Tier 1
- Additional Tier 1
- Tier I capital, which comprises highest quality capital element and include fully paid up capital, balance in share premium account, reserve for issue of bonus shares, general reserves and unappropriated profits (net of accumulated losses, if any).
2. Tier 2 Capital (gone-concern capital)
Tier II capital, which includes general reserve for loan losses, revaluation reserve, exchange translation reserve and subordinated debt.

Basel III capital rules requires bank to make certain deductions from the capital before arriving at the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR).

Risk weighted assets are measured according to the nature and reflect an estimate of credit, market and other risks associated with each asset and counterparty, taking into account any eligible collateral or guarantees. A similar treatment is adopted for off-balance sheet exposures, with some adjustments to reflect more contingent nature of potential losses.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

The Bank's policy is to maintain strong capital base so as to maintain, investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The adequacy of the Bank's capital is monitored using, among other measures, the rules and ratios established by the SBP. The ratios compare the amount of eligible capital with the total of risk-weighted assets. The Bank monitors and reports its capital ratio under the SBP rules, which ultimately determines the regulatory capital, required to be maintained by Banks and DFIs. The paid-up capital of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2024 stood at Rs. 21,275 million (2023 : Rs. 21,275 million) and is in compliance with the SBP requirement for the said period. In addition the Bank has maintained minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 28.05% (2023: 25.8%). There have been no material changes in the Bank's management of capital during the year.

# 49 RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk Management is a logical and/or systematic method to identify, measure, monitor and control the risks involved in any activity or process. Risk is inherent in all our business activities. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions/ penalties, and damage to our reputation; each of which may adversely impact on our ability to execute our business strategies. The Bank has taken a comprehensive approach towards risk management with a well-defined Risk Management Strategy/ Policy with clear objectives and deliverables through multi-pronged risk management processes. In the Bank, it is ensured that the risk management framework along with internal controls are adequate and effective in accurately identifying, assessing or addressing risks faced by the Bank.

The Bank applies the Basel framework as a cornerstone of its risk management framework, capital and liquidity strategy. The Bank maintains a strong capital, funding and liquidity position in line with its ongoing commitment to maintain balance sheet strength. The strength of risk profile management of the Bank stands at the following pillars:

- Identification and assessment of significant material risks
- Overseeing and managing the risk profile of the Bank within the context of the risk appetite
- Optimize risk/ return decisions by aligning them to business objective of achieving sustainable optimum growth.

To support Risk Management Group (RMG’s) activities, a strong data management mechanism is also in place to collect and consolidate exposure wise information for various risk related analysis and reviews. The mechanism also helps in identification of e-CIB related information, periodic reviews, generation of reports and highlighting inconsistencies and errors, and issuing instructions to the relevant data entry points for rectification.

The Bank is cognizant of importance of Environmental & Social Risk Management (E&SRM). The Green Banking Office (GBO) within Corporate Social Responsibility & Sustainable Development Division, Inclusive Development Group (IDG), is responsible for the development of Green Banking and Environmental & Social Risk Management (GB & ESRM) Policy and coordinates across functional areas of the Bank to oversee the implementation of GB & ESRM Policy.

## Chunk 793

# 49.1 Risk Governance Structure

The Board is responsible for ensuring active oversight of the implementation of policies and frameworks to prevent any significant financial loss or reduction in shareholder value. The Board manages its responsibility through Board Risk & Compliance Committee (BRCC) which is essentially a Board-level oversight committee that remains updated with regard to changes in the risk management activities of the Bank on behalf of the Board and is the highest risk-related policy making and supervising body for all types of risks faced by the Bank, notably credit, market, liquidity, operational, Information Security and other risks that may have material impact over the Bank’s performance. BRCC functions under its Terms of Reference (TORs) duly approved by the Board of Directors.

Risk Management Group (RMG) operates as an independent group under the supervision of Chief Risk Officer (CRO). RMG's scope and coverage has been enhanced to cater enterprise-wide risk management, credit risk management, credit administration and information security. CRO reports directly to the President with a dotted line reporting to the Board Risk & Compliance Committee (BRCC). The group is responsible for performing the functions pertaining to development and oversight of the risk framework, methodologies and other functions assigned from time to time in line with local/ international best practices and under the ambit of SBP’s regulations/ guidelines.

Risk governance of the Bank is being carried out by various management committees where material risks are addressed in more focused terms. These committees’ function under duly approved Terms of Reference (TORs) to oversee various Risk Management activities within their scope. Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) for Operational, Strategic, Reputational, and other risks; Management Credit Committee (MCC) for Credit Risk, Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) for Market & Liquidity Risk, and Compliance Committee for Management (CCM) for Compliance Risk.

## Chunk 795

# 49.2 Risk Management Framework

The Bank implements a risk management framework through a 'Three Lines of Defence' model & defines clear responsibilities and accountabilities for various offices and ensures effective & independent oversight and assurance that the activities take place as intended.

The First Line of Defence: Business groups have primary responsibility for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling the risks within their areas of accountability. They are required to implement effective procedures and controls to ensure compliance with the related policy requirements, to maintain appropriate risk management skills, and to act within defined parameters as a set and approved by the Board.

The Second Line of Defence: Primarily Risk Management and the Compliance functions in the Bank act as second line of defence however other support functions also perform control activities where applicable. These functions oversee and independently challenge the effectiveness of risk management actions taken by business groups which are further evaluated at Management-level Committees.

The Third Line of Defence: Audit & Inspection Group (A&IG) provides independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve risk management functions of the Bank. A&IG helps the Bank accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes.

The following paragraphs introduce Bank’s exposures to material risks associated with its business activities and explain overall strategies and processes to manage those risks:

---

## Chunk 796

# 49.2.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk arises when a counterparty fails to repay a loan, leading to financial losses, cash flow disruptions, and increased debt recovery costs. For NBP, lending activities represent the primary source of credit risk. These activities include providing loans and advances, contingent liabilities such as letters of credit and guarantees, and engaging in other on- and off-balance sheet transactions.

The goal of credit risk management is to maintain credit risk exposure within acceptable levels, ensuring asset quality and achieving returns that align with the level of risk. By taking a proactive approach to managing credit risk, NBP not only safeguards its profitability and sustainability but also supports the stability of the financial system and efficient capital allocation. Under the supervision of the Board Risk and Compliance Committee (BRCC), the Bank has a dedicated risk management setup, headed by the Chief Risk Officer, which ensures the efficiency of credit risk assessment, measurement, review, and reporting frameworks.

Prudent lending decisions can empower people and businesses to boost the bank’s profitability and strategically guard against the risks of extending credit. The effective implementation of structured risk assessment standards, comprehensive pre-disbursement evaluation tools, and post-disbursement review systems has allowed NBP to effectively manage credit risk and mitigate losses within acceptable tolerance levels. Our risk management approach is driven by a strategic goal to maintain a robust framework, proactively identify and address risks, and facilitate sustainable business growth. The bank has in place a Risk Appetite Framework and a Credit Risk Concentration Management Framework to set limits on credit risk exposure in relation to obligors, economic groups, and industry segments.

The Risk Management function continuously evaluates the credit portfolio using detailed reports and dashboards to identify borrowers and sectors vulnerable to changes in local and global economic conditions. The Bank actively monitors account delinquencies, counterparties' financial health, prevailing economic landscape, and other relevant factors. A robust credit review mechanism and approval process, closely supervised by senior management, ensures effective oversight.

## Chunk 797

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

The Bank has actively undertaken the implementation of the IFRS 9 standard. This standard introduces a model for financial assets, mandating the recognition of impairment charges through the 'Expected Credit Loss' approach, departing from the existing 'Incurred Credit Loss' approach.

The Retail & Program Lending Division performs risk management of program-based products, encompassing Retail Banking Group (RBG), Inclusive Development Group (IDG), and Aitemaad Islamic Banking Group (AIBG). Adopting a credit cycle approach, the Division provides end-to-end credit management through various functions that includes policy and portfolio management, MIS and analytics, credit approvals, collection and recovery and quality assurance. The division also works closely with Operational Risk, Information Technology, Credit Administration, and Human Resource functions to ensure comprehensive risk management. The Divisional Head reports directly to the Chief Risk Officer (CRO).

Effective Credit Administration is very crucial for the Bank as it enables the Bank to effectively manage credit risk, maintain regulatory compliance, and ensure financial stability. CAD, in view of its critical role in post-approval credit management, is actively contributing to portfolio expansion and granting individuals and businesses access to essential funds. As a part of continuous improvement, CAD has implemented additional controls and enhanced its monitoring with the aim to have more efficient end-to-end processes whilst maintaining appropriate controls. Moreover, CAD is actively working on automation, focusing on advanced collateral management functions, control over limit functions, and effective vendor management. Once the Core Banking Application (CBA) is upgraded, it is expected to significantly bolster the Bank's position within its peer group, reinforcing its overall strength and building customer confidence.

The Bank employs the Standardized Approach within the SBP’s Basel Accord to estimate credit risk-weighted assets. This approach allows banks to incorporate external ratings of counterparties when calculating risk-weighted assets. Additionally, stress testing for credit risk is performed to evaluate the potential impact of scenarios prescribed by the regulator.

The Bank employs the Standardized Approach within the SBP’s Basel Accord to estimate credit risk-weighted assets. This approach allows Banks to incorporate external ratings of counterparties when calculating risk-weighted assets. Additionally, stress testing for credit risk is performed to evaluate the potential impact of scenarios prescribed by the regulator.

Particulars of the Bank's significant on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet credit risk in various sectors are analysed as follows:

---

## Chunk 799

# 49.2.1.2 External ratings

The SBP Basel III guidelines require banks to use ratings assigned by specified External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) namely Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA), VIS and Moody's, Fitch and Standard & Poor's.

The SBP through its letter number BSD/BAI-2/201/1200/2009 dated December 21, 2009 accorded approval to the Bank for use of ratings assigned by Credit Rating Agency of Bangladesh (CRAB) and Credit Rating Information and Services Limited (CRISL). The Bank uses these ECAIs to rate its exposures denominated in Bangladeshi currency on certain corporate exposures and banks incorporated in Bangladesh.

The Bank uses external ratings for the purpose of mapping risk weights as per the Basel III framework. Instances whereby an exposure is rated by two or more ratings agencies, mapping into different risk weights, instructions outlined in Regulatory guidelines on BASEL framework shall be adhered to for selection of applicable rating.

# 49.2.1.3 Credit risk mitigation policy

The group defines collateral as the assets or rights provided to the group by the borrower or a third party in order to secure a credit facility. The group would have the rights of secured creditor in respect of the assets / contracts offered as security for the obligations of the borrower / obligor.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# 49.2.1.4  Collateral valuation and management

As stipulated in the SBP Basel guidelines, the group uses simple approach for credit risk mitigation. Under this approach the risk weighting of the collateral instrument collateralizing or partially collateralizing the exposure is substituted for the risk weighting of the counterparty.

---

## Chunk 802

# 49.2.1.5  Types of collaterals

The group determines the appropriate collateral for each facility based on the type of product and counterparty. In case of corporate and SME financing, fixed assets are generally taken as security for long tenure loans and current assets for working capital finance usually backed by mortgage or hypothecation. For project finance, security of the assets of the borrowers and assignment of the underlying project contracts are generally obtained. Additional security such as pledge of shares, cash collateral, TDRs, SSC/DSCs, charge on receivables may also be obtained. Moreover, in order to cover the entire exposure personal guarantees of directors / borrowers are also obtained generally by the group. For retail products, the security to be taken is defined in the product policy for the respective products. Housing loans and automobile loans are secured by the property and automobile being financed respectively.

The group also offers products which are primarily based on collateral such as shares, specified securities and pledged commodities. These products are offered in line with the SBP prudential regulations and approved product policies which also deal with types of collateral, valuation and margining.

The decision on the type and quantum of collateral for each transaction is taken by the credit approving authority as per the credit approval authorisation approved by the MCC under its delegation powers. For facilities provided as per approved product policies (retail products, loan against shares etc.), collateral is taken in line with the policy.

---

## Chunk 803

# 49.2.1.6  Types of eligible financial collateral

For credit risk mitigation purposes (capital adequacy purposes), the Bank considers all types of financial collaterals that are eligible under the SBP Basel III accord. This includes cash / TDRs, gold, securities issued by Government of Pakistan such as T-Bills and PIBs, National Savings Certificates, certain debt securities rated by recognised credit rating agencies, and guarantees from certain specified entities (Government of Pakistan, Banks etc.) under substitution effect of Basel.

---

## Chunk 804

# 49.2.1.7  Credit concentration risk

Credit concentration risk arises mainly due to concentration of exposures under various categories viz. industry, geography, and single/group borrower exposures. Within credit portfolio, as a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of risks, the SBP has prescribed regulatory limits on banks’ maximum exposure to single borrower, group borrowers and related parties. Moreover, in order to restrict the industry concentration risk, Bank’s Credit Risk Concentration Management Framework spells out the maximum allowable exposure that it can take on specific industry. Additionally, the Internal Rating System allows the Bank to monitor risk rating concentration of borrowers against different grades / scores ranging from 1 - 12 (1 being the best and 12 being loss category).

Particulars of the Bank's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet credit risk in various sectors are analysed as follows:

---

## Chunk 805

# 49.2.1.8  Methodologies and models used for the measurement of Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD).

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal / external rating grade for subject customer. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer / facility to the watch list, or the account being restructured. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 60 days past due.

When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Bank applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its financial instruments into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

---

## Chunk 806

# Stage 1 (Performing assets):

When financial instruments are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-months default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the forward looking LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

---

## Chunk 807

# Stage 2 (Underperforming assets):

When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

---

## Chunk 808

# Stage 3 (Non performing assets):

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises LTECLs for these instruments. A description of how the Bank defines credit-impaired and default is given in relevant section. The Bank uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP.

---

## Chunk 809

# Undrawn financing commitments:

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. Expected draw-down is added to the EAD and the ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows of EAD if the financings are drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. For revolving facilities that include both financings and an undrawn commitment, ECLs are calculated on un-drawn portion (after application of CCF) of the facility and presented within other liabilities.

---

## Chunk 810

# Guarantee and letters of credit contracts:

The Bank estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven credit conversion factor (CCF) for financial guarantee and letter of credit contracts respectively. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to financial guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within other liabilities.

---

## Chunk 811

# Forward looking information:

The Bank has performed historical analysis and identified the key economic variables impacting credit risk and expected credit losses for Wholesale & Retail portfolio. These economic variables and their associated impact on the PD vary by the portfolio. The rating band / DPD bucket wise PDs are computed through migration analysis using at least 5 years historical transition matrices of respective portfolio. Furthermore, a detailed regression analysis is carried out using Macro Economic variables (i.e. Average Inflation rate, GDP Growth rate and Exports were regressed against Bank's Internal Default Rates) in order to attain forward-looking PDs for each following year. In addition to the base economic scenario, the Bank also uses other possible scenarios along with scenario weightings. The number of scenarios and their attributes are reassessed at each reporting date.

---

## Chunk 812

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

For expected credit loss provisions modelled on a collective basis, a grouping of exposures is performed on the basis of shared risk characteristics, such that risk exposures within a group are homogeneous.

In its ECL models, the Bank relies on range of the following forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

- GDP growth
- Consumer price index
- Export

The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is measured on either a 12-month (12M) or Lifetime basis depending on whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred since initial recognition or whether an asset is considered to be credit-impaired. Expected credit losses are the discounted product of the Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD), discounted at an approximation to the EIR, defined as follows:

---

## Chunk 813

# Probability of Default (PD):

The Probability of default (PD) represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation, either over the next 12 months (12M PD), or over the remaining lifetime (Lifetime PD) of the obligation.

- For corporate, commercial, and SME loan portfolios, the Bank has used a obligor risk rating (ORR) transition based approach to determine the segment wise PDs for each ORR.
- For housing, agriculture, cash and gold and advance salary, a days-past-due (“DPD”) based migration approach has been used; and these PD's for wholesale & retail portfolio are then adjusted with forward looking information to arrive at point in time (PIT) PDs;
- For other financial assets (i.e. investments, lending to financial institutions, balances with other banks etc.), historical PDs were estimated on the basis of global default Rates taken from s&P rating-wise transition matrices. These annual default Rates were converted into forward-looking PDs using the vasicek model. The forecast global macro-economic variables were derived using historical regression between global macro-economic variables and Pakistan macro-economic variables.

---

## Chunk 814

# Exposure at Default (EAD)

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has a legal right to call it earlier. The Bank’s product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail facilities, in which the Bank has the right to cancel and/or reduce the facilities with one day notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Bank does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the Bank’s expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the Bank’s future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

---

## Chunk 815

# Loss Given Default (LGD):

LGD represents an estimate of the loss incurred on a facility in the event of default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive. It is expressed as a percentage of the EAD. Bank has estimated segment wise LGDs for Corporate / Commercial, SE, ME & Agri Portfolio as well as product wise LGDs for Auto Finance, Personal Loan, Home Finance and Credit Card portfolio. The LGDs are determined using workout approach, based on vintage recovery data for the defaulted portfolio; these recoveries are then discounted back to date of default, to factor in time value of money.

The Bank has converted the estimates for segment / product wise historical LGDs (Through the cycle LGDs) into forward looking point in time LGDs, through use of term structure of Point in time Pds.

---

## Chunk 816

# ECL Principles, Grouping and Calculations

The ECL is determined by projecting the PD, LGD and EAD for each future repayment date and for each individual exposure. These three components are multiplied together, effectively calculating an ECL for each future repayment date, which is then discounted back to the reporting date and summed.

---

## Chunk 817

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective interest rate (at reporting date), the Bank uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date). When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three scenarios (a base, best and a worst case). Each of these scenario's is based on different macro-economic forecasts and is associated with different set of PDs & LGD. Furthermore, to mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The Bank considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics:

- History of legal certainty & enforceability
- History of recovery

The Bank's management has only considered cash, gold & gold ornaments, liquid securities, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals, while calculating EADs. Furthermore, the credit exposure (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

---

## Chunk 818

# Impact on Regulatory Capital:

The introduction of IFRS 9 has resulted in reduction in regulatory capital of the Banks, which has reduced their lending capacity and ability to support their clients. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has permitted Banks to opt for transitional arrangement for the ECL impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the 'Application Instructions' issued by SBP has detailed the transitional arrangement.

Accordingly, Bank has opted for transition arrangement to phase in ECL impact and below tabulated is the impact on key ratios, had the transitional arrangement not applied.

|Key Ratios|With Transitional arrangement|Without Transitional arrangement|
|---|---|---|
|Total Capital to total RWA (CAR)|28.05%|26.48%|
|Leverage Ratio|3.93%|3.72%|

## Chunk 819

# 49.2.1.10 ECL Modeling and staging criteria/ Significant increase in ECLs

Significant increase in credit risk (SICR): A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument compared to the risk of default expected at the time of initial recognition. The Bank uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR including, inter alia, the deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR), in line with Bank's internally approved grid outlining specific notches downgrade for each ORR / external rating, payments being past due by 60 days, and other qualitative factors (such as watchlisting or restructuring of account).

---

## Chunk 820

# 49.2.1.11 Loans and advances definitions and methodologies of categorisation, credit loss allowance stages and movements between stages

Backward Transition: In line with Bank's IFRS 9 Policy and Regulatory guidelines, financial assets shall be reclassified out of Stage 3 if they fulfill the criteria outlined in the Prudential Regulations (PR) issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Similarly, financial assets classified under Stage 2 shall be reclassified to Stage 1 if the conditions that led to a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) no longer exist. However, a minimum period of three months from the initial downgrade is mandatory before any facility can be moved back to Stage 1 from Stage 2. For a facility to transition from Stage 3 to Stage 2, it must meet the declassification requirements specified in the relevant Prudential Regulations. An exposure cannot be directly upgraded from Stage 3 to Stage 1; instead, it must first transition to Stage 2 and subsequently complete a cooling-off period of three months before being reclassified to Stage 1.

# 49.2.2 Market risk

Market Risk is the value of on and off-balance sheet positions of a financial institution that are adversely affected by movements in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads and/or commodity prices resulting in a loss to earnings and capital.

The Bank’s market risk is managed through Market & Liquidity Risk Management Policy duly approved by the Board. The Bank has in-place market risk limits to manage risks within the Bank's approved risk appetite.

The Standardized Approach is used to calculate capital charge for market risk as per Basel framework. Stress testing for interest sensitive, equity, and FX exposures is carried out regularly to estimate the impact on the capital of the Bank.

In addition to the regulatory requirements, Bank has devised proprietary stress testing scenarios which are periodically performed to assess the impact on capital of the Bank for Internal Capital Adequacy and Assessment Process (ICAAP). Limits/ zones and management action triggers/ plans corresponding to various ratios/ limits/ thresholds are defined in the Market & Liquidity Risk Policy. Appropriate segregation of duties exists between the front, middle, and back office functions.

# 49.2.2.4  Yield / Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)-Basel II Specific

Interest rate risk arises due to adverse movements in yield curve that is being monitored by ALCO with an objective to manage the potential adverse impact on the profitability of the Bank. This may arise due to volatility in market interest rates and any mismatch/ gaps in the amount of financial assets/ liabilities in different maturity time bands. The sources of IRR are based on following sub-risks.

- Re-pricing risk; arising from changes to the overall level of interest rates and inherent mismatches in the re-pricing term of banking book items.
- Yield curve risk; arising from a change in the relative level of interest rates for different tenors and changes in the slope or shape of the yield curve.
- Basis risk; arising from differences between the actual and expected interest margins on Banking book items over the implied cost of funds of those items.

# 49.2.3    Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. This definition includes legal risk but excludes strategic and reputational risks. For effective implementation, the group has a comprehensive Operational Risk Management Policy Framework (ORMPF) and procedures. These provide guidance for setting up operational risk strategy of the group, selection and adoption of risk and loss measurement tools, reporting, and establishment of operational risk management process.

Operational risks are core components of doing business arising from the day-to-day operational activities of the group including launching of new products and services. The group realizes that operational risks cannot be fully mitigated, it therefore determines an appropriate balance between accepting potential losses and related costs of mitigation.

Further, the group has adopted an Operational Risk Management Policy Framework and Operational Risk Appetite duly approved by the Board. Furthermore, the group has rolled-out operational risk events (OREs) collection mechanism whereby field functionaries and Groups/Divisions at head office are responsible to report operational losses under their jurisdictions on immediate basis. OREs are reviewed and appropriate corrective measures are taken on an ongoing basis. Risk Evaluation exercise is carried out for new products, processes and systems as per the ORM procedures.

The group also conducts root cause analysis of major OREs covering key control lapses and accordingly suggests mitigating actions. As per regulatory framework, the group calculates capital charge for its operational risk using Basic Indicator Approach (BIA).

Moreover, the group closely monitored overall operational environment and undertakes required actions to ensure the safety and security of the group's staff and its assets. The group takes measures to ensure continuously improve customer service levels and resolve related complaints to meet the expectations of its stakeholders.

The group's operations stays highly resilient and the group deploys all necessary measures for the health and safety of its employees to prevent them from any unwarranted situation.

# 49.2.4 Information Security Risk

Management of Information Security risk is given due importance, considering extensive customer base and increasing digital footprint of the group. A mechanism has been devised for upscaling technology infrastructure and related channels from information security standpoint. Further, due to evolving cyber threat landscape, the group has taken appropriate actions to monitor and respond to cybersecurity risks and adopted a heightened state of cybersecurity. We are living in a highly technologically dependent environment, where most of the business functions are performed with information technology for storing, processing and sharing of information. The information “assets” that are being used to store, process and transmit the information face various types of threats. If threats materialize and are able to exploit the vulnerabilities (weaknesses) present in these information assets, the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information get compromised and/or may result in a breakdown of IT assets. In order to mitigate the risks, certain controls and countermeasures need to be assessed and implemented. The group has devised a governance mechanism to manage related risks through development of policies & frameworks, and deployed security tools to ensure adequate implementation of internal controls and monitoring of security threats within technology infrastructure.

As a first line of defense, the Business groups have primary responsibility for identifying, measuring, and controlling the risks within their areas of accountability. Information Security Division (ISD) is the second line of defense against cyber risks. Therefore, the group regularly assesses the information security controls and undertakes employees’ awareness and training. The group works with its key technology partners to ensure that potentially vulnerable systems are identified and appropriate fixes & controls are implemented to secure the systems. The group is actively communicating with its customers on interacting with the group in a secure manner through its full suite of channels including online and digital grouping.

Over the last two years, the group has taken various initiatives to uplift its cyber security controls. Management is cognizant of the fact that cyber security is a top priority, and the group is taking appropriate steps to monitor and respond to it. The Information Security Division (ISD) works under the supervision of Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Numerous steps have been taken by the group to identify cyber security weaknesses of systems & infrastructure.

# 49.2.5 Enterprise-wide Risk

The group has a Board approved Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework in place. The ERM framework is a holistic approach starting from strategy setting, capital and financial planning to managing, monitoring, and reporting of risks inherent in the day-to-day business of the group. It documents the risk management structure and processes driven by the group’s board of directors, management, and other personnel. All this provides reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the group’s strategic objectives.

In addition to the Pillar I risks, the group has a structure to identify other Pillar II material risks on a periodic basis. The group has in place an Internal Capital Adequacy & Assessment Process (ICAAP) to identify and quantify material risks, including Pillar II risks, and continually re-assess the adequacy of the capital buffer and risk appetite, which is set periodically in order to build a solid platform for business growth.

In accordance with the regulatory requirements for Domestic Systematically Important groups (D-SIBs), the group has put in place a Recovery Plan to prepare the group to act promptly and efficiently in the event of stress situations that may threaten the financial and operational strength and viability of a group and pose a risk on group’s ability to remain a going concern. Moreover, risks that are material and arise within the group or due to behaviour of the country’s market and economic conditions, whether in isolation or in combination are addressed in the group-wide Recovery Plan.

Group’s Stress-testing framework comprises of tools to deliver a timely assessment of the resilience of the group’s capital under stressed conditions to the senior management. It ranges from simple sensitivity analysis to sophisticated stress testing methods to capture the abnormal movement of market and economic indicators and to translate such scenarios into projections of group’s profitability, liquidity and capital planning.

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

This framework paves the way to a quantitative, forward-looking assessment of capital adequacy (movement/ level of Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of the group) to provide an indication of how much capital might be needed to absorb any expected and any unforeseen losses. It helps in identifying potential vulnerabilities within the group and assessing solvency by applying plausible/ past adverse scenarios under extreme conditions.

## Chunk 844

# 49.2.6 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk of loss to a group arising from its inability to meet obligations as they fall due or to fund assets, without incurring unacceptable costs or losses. More simply, liquidity risk is the possibility that a group will be unable to meet its financial commitment to a customer, creditor, or investor when due, in a timely and cost-effective manner.

To mitigate this risk, the group has arranged diversified funding sources, manages specific assets with liquidity in mind and monitors liquidity position on daily basis. In addition, the group maintains statutory deposits with central groups inside and outside Pakistan. The purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to meet all of the group's liabilities when due, under both normal and stress conditions without incurring unacceptable losses, as well as to capitalize on opportunities for business expansion and profitability. This includes the group's ability to meet deposit withdrawals either on demand or at contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature and to make new loans and investments, as opportunities arise.

The Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) is responsible for ensuring that the group has adequate liquidity and monitors liquidity gaps, to execute this responsibility. Mandatory as well as optional stress testing and ratio based liquidity assessments are performed to proactively identify and manage liquidity position, needs/ requirements. The group has put in place various limits/ ratios, triggers and related management actions in place to monitor and mitigate liquidity risk. The group calculates and monitors, on regular basis, Basel-III Liquidity standards (includes LCR, NSFR and LMTs), liquidity ratios as per SBP parameters besides other internal liquidity measures.

# 49.2.7 Derivative risk

A derivative is a contract that derives its value from the performance of an underlying asset which can be an index, interest rate, commodity price, security price, FX rate etc. Derivatives include forwards, futures, swaps, options etc. In Pakistan, futures and forwards are most commonly traded derivatives.

Currently, the group is not an active participant in the Pakistan derivatives market as it does not hold an Authorized Derivative Dealer (ADD) license to perform derivative transactions. Once acquired, the group will carry out transactions that are permitted under the Financial Derivatives Business Regulations issued by SBP, which may include Interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, foreign currency options, etc.

Moreover, the Bank may also offer other over the counter derivative products to satisfy customer requirements, specific approval of which will be sought from the SBP on a transaction by transaction basis.

# 11 Pool Management

NBP-AIBG has managed following pools for profit and loss distribution.

a) General depositor pool

The General pool consists of all other remunerative deposits. NBP Aitemaad (the Mudarib) accept deposits on the basis of Mudaraba from depositors (Rabbulmaal). The net return on the pool is arrived at after deduction of direct costs from the gross return earned on the pool. The entire net return after paying equity share to Mudarib is considered as distributable profit of the pool.

## Chunk 883

# ANNEXURE ‘II’ AS REFERRED TO IN NOTES 2.2 AND 11.8 OF THE BANK’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# b) Special depositor pools

(Total 253 during the period and 33 as at Dec 31, 2024)

Special pool(s) are created where the customers desire to invest in high yield assets. These pool(s) rates are higher than the general pool depending on the assets. In case of loss in special pool, the loss will be borne by the special pool members. The net return on the pool is arrived at after deduction of direct costs from the gross return earned on the pool. From the net return, and after allocation of share of profit to commingled equity, profit is paid to the Mudarib in the ratio of the Mudarib’s equity in the pool to the total pool. The balance represents the distributable profit.

# c) Equity pool

Equity pools include AIBG's fund and current account deposits. The equity pool may have constructive liquidation every month and risk associated with assets of pool includes operational, market, equity, return and Shariah.

---

## Chunk 884

# Key features and risk & reward characteristics

Deposits are accepted from customers on the basis of Qard (current accounts) and Mudarabah (Saving and term deposits). No profit or loss is passed on to current account depositors.

For deposits accepted on Mudarabah basis from depositors (Rab ul Maal) the Bank acts as Manager (Mudarib) and invests the funds in the Shariah Compliant modes of financings. Rab ul Maal share is distributed among depositors according to weightages declared for a month before start of the period.

In case of loss in a pool during the profit calculation period, the loss is distributed among the depositors (remunerative) according to their ratio of investment.

For all pools, the Mudarib’s share is deducted from the distributable profit to calculate the profit to be allocated to depositors. The allocation of the profit to various deposit categories is determined by the amount invested in that category relative to the total pool, as well as by the weightage assigned to the various deposit categories.

The assets, liabilities, equities, income and expenses are segregated for each of the pool. No pool investment is intermingled with each other. The risk associated with each pool is thus equally distributed among the pools.
