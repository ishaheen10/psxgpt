## Chunk 2

# Economic Environment

The global economic outlook shows signs of stabilization with moderating inflation, strengthening trade, and broader monetary easing, contributing to a soft landing. Global growth is projected to stabilize at 3.0% in 2024, rising to 3.3% in 2025.

In FY'24, Pakistan's economy underwent broad‐based stabilization supported by a relatively conducive global economic environment. It rebounded with 2.4% GDP growth, driven by agricultural sector and a modest 1.1% rise in Large Scale Manufacturing, recovering from a 9.8% decline in FY'23. As the SBP and the government have continued with the macroeconomic stabilization measures, The SBP anticipates further growth, projecting GDP to range between 2.5% and 3.5% in FY'25.

Headline inflation decreased from 29.2% in FY'23 to 23.4% in FY'24, thanks to lower food prices. Inflation is expected to ease further to 15% in FY'25, supported by prudent monetary policy, reduced exchange rate volatility, and global economic stability. With falling inflation and an improved external account, the SBP had adequate room to cut the policy rate by 450 basis points, lowering it from 22% in June 2024 to 17.5% in October 2024.

Workers' remittances grew by 10.7%, reaching $30.3 billion in FY'24, strengthening Pakistan’s FX reserves, which rose from $13.1 billion in September 2023 to $16.0 billion by September 2024.

The Pakistan Stock Exchange made an exceptional run in 2024, setting new records and outperforming even the most optimistic projections as the KSE‐100 Index surging to 86,000+ points from 62,451 points at the end of 2023. This positions it as the top‐performing asset class in the country delivering near 100 percent return in dollar terms. Looking ahead, the country’s economic outlook is stable, with anticipated political stability, IMF deal in line, anticipated foreign exchange inflows and improved economic outlook.

Banking industry outlook is promising and is expected to benefit from stronger economic growth and a rebound in credit demand, driven by IMF support and a reduced policy rate in the second half of 2024. With a more optimistic outlook for inflation, interest rates, and emerging economic stability, loan growth is expected to accelerate. Credit to the private sector is expected to gradually recover, largely driven by increased demand in key industries such as wholesale and retail trade. Despite some credit cost pressures on account of implementation of IFRS‐9, overall credit quality remains satisfactory, and the anticipated easing of monetary policy in 2024 should help reduce the risk of increase in non‐performing loans.

## Chunk 4

# Mark‐up/Interest Income

For the nine‐months period under review, your Bank earned Gross Interest Income 'GII' of PKR 833.7 Bn as against PKR 728.7 Bn for the corresponding nine‐months period of 2023. The PKR 105.0 Bn increase in GII was achieved through a volumetric growth in average interest‐bearing assets coupled with the favourable impact of average policy rate during 9M'24. During this period, the Bank's investments averaged PKR 4,328.3 Bn (9M'23:PKR 3,760.5 Bn) and generated a mark‐up/interest income of PKR 652.8 Bn being PKR 111.2 Bn or 20.5% up against PKR 541.6 Bn for 9M'23. This translates into average yield at 20.17% (9M'23:19.26%). In the prevailing policy rate environment, maturity profile of the Bank's investment book remains as a strategy oriented towards a shorter duration investment securities. Similarly, placements, that averaged PKR 105.5 Bn (9M'23:PKR 153.7 Bn) generated a mark‐up income of PKR 10.2 Bn (9M'23: PKR 22.5 Bn), yielding 12.96%.

The Bank's loan book generated a mark‐up income of PKR 170.6 Bn i.e., PKR 6.1 Bn or 3.7% higher than PKR 164.5 Bn of 9M'23. This too was achieved through both, a volumetric growth by PKR 5.4 Bn, as well as the favourable rate variance with growth observed in Corporate, SME/Commercial and retail loan portfolios. Pertinent to mention, this growth in income was achieved despite the Bank carrying a higher proportion of lower‐margin and non‐performing loans of certain state‐owned entities. Likewise, on the back of higher average policy rate, the Bank's cost of funds for 9M'24 also stood higher at PKR 728.5 Bn as compared to PKR 608.1 Bn for the similar 9M period of 2023. This increase of PKR 120.4 Bn or 19.8% was mainly contributed by an increase in cost of Deposits by PKR 90.7 Bn. Consequently, the Net Interest Income 'NII' for the period under review closed at PKR 105.2 Bn, depicting a decrease of 12.8% against PKR 120.6 Bn of 9M'23.

## Chunk 5

# Non‐Fund Income

Non‐Fund Income 'NFI' for the 9M'24 closed at PKR 42.0 Bn which is PKR 17.3 Bn or 69.9% higher than PKR 24.7 Bn of 9M'23. While fee & commission income recorded a YoY increase of 15.3% to close at PKR 17.2 Bn (9M'23:PKR 14.9 Bn), the dividend income increased by PKR 0.74 Bn or 21.9% to close at PKR 4.1 Bn. On the other hand, while FX income increased by 126.6% to close at PKR 5.1 Bn as against PKR 2.3 Bn for 9M'23, capital gains recorded an increase of PKR 12.7 Bn or 528.3% to close at PKR 15.2 Bn (9M'23:PKR 2.4 Bn). This includes PKR 5.8 Bn of capital gain recognised through sale of the bank’s entire shareholding in the UNBL. Going forward, the NFI is expected to stay strong as the economic situation is showing stability with an expected rise in the stock market as well as the foreign exchange reserves to continue.

## Chunk 6

# Operating Expenses

Amidst the high inflationary pressures, operating expenses of the Bank for the nine‐months period under review amounted to PKR 77.9 Bn which is 19.4% higher YoY as compared to PKR 65.2 Bn for the similar period last year. HR cost that constitutes around 64.0% of the total operating expenses, amounted to PKR 49.8 Bn depicting a YoY increase of PKR 7.8 Bn or 18.5%. While property related expenses amounted to PKR 10.3 Bn (9M'23:PKR 8.2 Bn), IT related expenses amounted to PKR 5.2 Bn (9M'23: PKR 4.2 Bn) as the Bank is continuing to upgrade its IT infrastructure.

Notably, with an increase in the operating costs, the Bank’s cost‐to‐income ratio for the nine‐months period ended September 30, 2024 stood at 52.9% as against 45.0% for the similar period last year under a prudent cost control strategy. Increase observed in the operating expenses incurred during the period are in line with the inflationary pressures and industry norms.

## Chunk 7

# Credit Loss Allowances & Provisioning

The Bank prudently identifies impairments in its asset portfolio and maintains strong level of provisions thereagainst. During 9M'24, the Bank’s gross non‐performing loans dropped marginally to PKR 218.2 Bn from PKR 220.8 Bn as on Dec 31, 2023. While specific provisioning stood at PKR 220.1 Bn (Dec'23: PKR 203.6 Bn), credit loss allowances held against the performing loans & advances (Stage‐1 and Stage‐2) amount to PKR 42.5 Bn (Dec'23: PKR 30.0 Bn) as of Sep’24. Thus, specific provision coverage stood high at 96.0% as of September 30, 2024.

For the nine‐months period under review, a net reversal of PKR 0.27 Bn was recorded in provisioning for credit loss allowances as compared to a total charge of PKR 9.2 Bn for the corresponding nine months period of 2023. Key contributor towards this drop were reduction in charge for diminution in value of investments that recorded a net reduction of PKR 1.1 Bn against a charge of PKR 1.2 Bn in Sep’23, and a PKR 6.8 Bn drop in credit loss allowances against loans & advances that stood at PKR 0.7 Bn as against PKR 7.5 Bn in Sep’23.

# 3.2 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

As per SBP BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9 is applicable on banks with effect from January 01, 2024. IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of accounting for financial liabilities. To determine appropriate classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments, to be assessed based on combination of the entity's business model for managing the assets and the instruments' contractual cash flow characteristics. The adoption of IFRS 9 has also fundamentally changed the impairment method of financial assets with a forward-looking Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach.

'The SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 has made certain amendments and extended the timelines of SBP's IFRS 9 Application Instructions to address most of the matters raised by the banks with a direction to ensure compliance by the extended timeline.

There are a few matters which include maintenance of general provision, income recognition on islamic financings and fair valuation of subsidized loans, the treatments of which are still under deliberation with the SBP. The Bank has continued to follow the treatment adopted in respect of these matters in the prior periods till the time SBP issues the relevant guidance / clarification.

The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in the Bank's accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 has also significantly impacted disclosures related to the unconsolidated financial instruments.

The Bank performed a detailed analysis of its business models for managing financial assets and analysis of their contractual cash flows characteristics.

The following table reconciles the aggregate opening loan loss provision allowances under SBP Prudential Regulations to the ECL allowances under IFRS 9:

|Provision as per current regulatory framework|Remeasurement (ECL)|Reclassification|ECLs under IFRS 9|
|---|---|---|---|
|Impairment allowance against:| | | |
|Cash and Balances with Treasury Banks|-|-|-|
|Balance with Other Banks|117,033|118|117,151|

# 3.2.1 Classification

Financial assets

Under IFRS 9, existing categories of financial assets: Held for trading (HFT), Available for sale (AFS), Held to maturity (HTM) and loans and receivables have been replaced by:

- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss account (FVTPL)
- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- Financial assets at amortised cost

Financial liabilities

Under IFRS 9, the accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus financial liabilities are being carried at amortised cost except for derivatives which are being measured at FVTPL.

---

## Chunk 40

# 3.2.2 Business model:

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Bank's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Bank's key management personnel;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank’s assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:

1. Hold to Collect (HTC) business model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash
2. Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S) business model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
3. Other business models: Resulting in classification of financial assets as FVTPL

---

## Chunk 41

# 3.2.3 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest / profit (SPPI)

As a second step of its classification process, the Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. ‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium / discount). The most significant elements of interest / profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as, but not limited to, the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest / profit rate is set. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL.

---

## Chunk 42

# 3.2.4 Application to the Bank's financial assets

Debt based financial assets

Debt based financial assets held by the Bank include: advances, lending to financial institutions, investment in federal government securities, corporate bonds and other private sukuks, cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks, and other financial assets.

a) These are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following conditions and 'are not designated as FVTPL:

- the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

# 6

The Bank’s business model for these financial assets can still be HTC even when sales of these financial assets occur. However, if more than an infrequent number of sales of significant value are made, the Bank assesses whether and how the sales are consistent with the HTC objective.

---

## Chunk 43

# b) Debt based financial assets

Debt based financial assets are measured at FVOCI only if these meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as FVTPL:

- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

---

## Chunk 44

# c) Debt based financial assets

If these are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

---

## Chunk 45

# Equity instruments

Equity instruments are instruments that meet the definition of equity from the issuer's perspective; that is, instruments that do not contain a contractual obligation to pay and that evidence a residual share in the issuer's net assets.

The Bank measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, except where the Bank's management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Bank's policy is to designate equity investments as FVOCI when those investments are held for purposes other than for trading. When this election is used, fair value gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to the profit and loss account, including on disposal. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return on such investments, continue to be recognised in the profit and loss account as income when the Bank's right to receive payments is established.

IFRS 9 has removed the requirement for impairment assessments on equity investments. However, under BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024, dated July 29, 2024, Banks may continue to measure unquoted equity securities at the lower of cost or break-up value until December 31, 2024. Starting January 1, 2025, Banks will be required to measure unquoted equity securities at fair value, as mandated by the IFRS 9 application guidelines. For unquoted securities where the break-up value is lower than the cost, the difference has been classified as a loss and charged to the profit and loss account. Gains and losses on equity instruments at FVTPL are included in the ‘Gain on sales of securities’ line in the profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 46

# 3.2.5 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Bank purchases or sells the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like advances, lending to financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account or financial institutions. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased.

---

## Chunk 47

# a) Amortised cost (AC)

Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest income / profit / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 48

# b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for debt based financial assets in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of debt based financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is transferred from surplus / deficit to unappropriated profit.

---

## Chunk 49

# 3.2.5 Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost will be directly recorded in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

---

## Chunk 50

# 3.2.6 Derecognition

# Financial assets

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

---

## Chunk 51

# Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 52

# 3.3 Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with all advances and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Bank recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money; and
- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject customer. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer / facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 60 days past due. When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Bank applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

# 8

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3, as described below:

---

## Chunk 53

# Stage 1:

When financial instruments are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

---

## Chunk 54

# Stage 2:

When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

# Stage 3:

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises the LTECLs for these instruments. The Bank uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP.

---

## Chunk 55

# Undrawn financing commitments

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the financings is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. For revolving facilities that include both a financings and an undrawn commitment, ECLs are calculated on un-drawn portion of the facility and presented within other liabilities.

---

## Chunk 56

# Guarantee and letters of credit contracts

The Bank estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven and internally developed credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit contracts respectively. The calculation is made using a probability weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within other liabilities.

# The calculation of ECLs

The Bank calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash flows, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:

---

## Chunk 57

# PD

The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the last 7 years. PDs for Non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.

---

## Chunk 58

# EAD

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest / profit from missed payments. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has a legal right to call it earlier. The Bank's product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail facilities, in which the Bank has the right to cancel and / or reduce the facilities with one day notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Bank does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the Bank expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the Bank future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

---

## Chunk 59

# LGD

The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD.

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective interest rate (at reporting date), the Bank uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date).

Effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The Bank considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics:

- History of legal certainty and enforceability
- History of enforceability and recovery

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three scenarios (a base case, a best case, a worst case). Each of these is associated with different PDs.

The Bank's management has only considered cash, liquid securities, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals, while calculating EADs.

The credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level for corporate / commercial / SME loan portfolios and at Forward looking information.

In its ECL models, the Bank relies on range of the following forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

- GDP Growth
- Consumer Price Index
- Unemployment rate

---

## Chunk 60

# Definition of default

The concept of "impairment or "default" is critical to the implementation of IFRS 9 as it drives determination of risk parameters, i.e. PD, LGD and EAD.

This implies that if one facility of a counterparty becomes 90+ DPD in repaying its contractual dues or as defined in PRs; all other facilities would deem to be classified as stage 3.

# Write-offs

The Bank's accounting policy under IFRS 9 remains the same as it was under SBP regulations / exiting reporting framework.

---

## Chunk 61

# 3.4 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held-for-sale

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held-for-sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of derecognition.

Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the statement of financial position. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the statement of financial position.

# 35. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted instruments classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# Financial Instruments Analysis

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorized:

# Valuation Techniques Used in Determination of Fair Valuation of Financial Instruments within Level 2 and Level 3

Federal Government securities: The fair value of Federal Government securities is determined using the prices / rates available on Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) / Reuter page / Pakistan Stock Exchange.

Non-Government debt securities: The fair value of non-government debt securities is determined using the prices / rates from MUFAP / Pakistan Stock Exchange.

Mutual Fund units: The fair values of investments in mutual fund units are determined based on their net asset values as published on MUFAP.

Foreign Securities: The fair value of foreign securities is determined using the prices from Reuter page.

Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions: The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.

Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims: Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 39.9 Pool Management

NBP-AIBG has managed following pools for profit and loss distribution.

---

## Chunk 139

# a) General depositor pool

The General pool consists of all other remunerative deposits. NBP Aitemaad (the Mudarib) accept deposits on the basis of Mudaraba from depositors (Rabbulmaal). The net return on the pool is arrived at after deduction of direct costs from the gross return earned on the pool. The entire net return after paying equity share to Mudarib is considered as distributable profit of the pool.

---

## Chunk 140

# b) Special depositor pools

(Total 161 during the period and 64 as at September 30, 2024) Special pool(s) are created where the customers desire to invest in high yield assets. These pool(s) rates are higher than the general pool depending on the assets. In case of loss in special pool, the loss will be borne by the special pool members. The net return on the pool is arrived at after deduction of direct costs from the gross return earned on the pool. From the net return, and after allocation of share of profit to commingled equity, profit is paid to the Mudarib in the ratio of the Mudarib’s equity in the pool to the total pool. The balance represents the distributable profit.

# c) Equity pool

Equity pools include AIBG's fund and current account deposits. The equity pool may have constructive liquidation every month and risk associated with assets of pool includes operational, market, equity, return and Shariah.

---

## Chunk 141

# Key features and risk & reward characteristics

Deposits are accepted from customers on the basis of Qard (current accounts) and Mudarabah (Saving and term deposits). No profit or loss is passed on to current account depositors.

For deposits accepted on Mudarabah basis from depositors (Rab ul Maal) the Bank acts as Manager (Mudarib) and invests the funds in the Shariah Compliant modes of financings. Rab ul Maal share is distributed among depositors according to weightages declared for a month before start of the period.

In case of loss in a pool during the profit calculation period, the loss is distributed among the depositors (remunerative) according to their ratio of investment.

For all pools, the Mudarib’s share is deducted from the distributable profit to calculate the profit to be allocated to depositors. The allocation of the profit to various deposit categories is determined by the amount invested in that category relative to the total pool, as well as by the weightage assigned to the various deposit categories.

The assets, liabilities, equities, income and expenses are segregated for each of the pool. No pool investment is intermingled with each other. The risk associated with each pool is thus equally distributed among the pools.

No provision against any non performing asset of the pool is passed on to the pool except on the actual loss / write off of such non performing asset. Administrative expense are borne by mudarib and not charged to Mudaraba pool.

Dear Shareholders,

Consolidated after‐tax profit for the nine months period ended September 30, 2024, amounted to PKR 3.92 Bn, being 90.07% lower than PKR 39.51 Bn for the same period last year. During nine months, the subsidiary companies contributed PKR 1.105 Bn (September 30, 2023: PKR 0.989 Bn) in Group profitability, whereas the associates contributed share of profit of PKR 0.144 Bn (September 30, 2023: PKR 0.078 Bn). A share of profit of PKR 0.605 Bn (September 30, 2023: PKR 0.930 Bn) was however recorded on account of UNBL, a UK based Joint Venture in which NBP had 45% shareholding. During the period, the bank has divested NBP’s share of 45% in UNBL to Bestway group. Accordingly, consolidated EPS per share recorded at PKR 1.67 for the nine months period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to EPS of PKR 18.49 for the same period last year.

## Chunk 164

# 3.2.1 Classification

# Financial assets

Under IFRS 9, existing categories of financial assets: Held for trading (HFT), Available for sale (AFS), Held to maturity (HTM) and loans and receivables have been replaced by:

- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss account (FVTPL)
- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- Financial assets at amortised cost

# Financial liabilities

Under IFRS 9, the accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus financial liabilities are being carried at amortised cost except for derivatives which are being measured at FVTPL.

---

## Chunk 165

# 3.2.2 Business model:

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Bank's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Bank's key management personnel;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank’s assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:

1. Hold to Collect (HTC) business model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash
2. Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC&S) business model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
3. Other business models: Resulting in classification of financial assets as FVTPL

---

## Chunk 166

# 3.2.3 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest / profit (SPPI)

As a second step of its classification process, the Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. ‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium / discount). The most significant elements of interest / profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as, but not limited to, the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest / profit rate is set. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL.

---

## Chunk 167

# 3.2.4 Application to the Bank's financial assets

# Debt based financial assets

Debt based financial assets held by the Bank include: advances, lending to financial institutions, investment in federal government securities, corporate bonds and other private sukuks, cash and balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks, and other financial assets.

a) These are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following conditions and 'are not designated as FVTPL:

- the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

---

## Chunk 168

# 3.2.5 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Bank purchases or sells the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like advances, lending to financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account or financial institutions. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased.

---

## Chunk 169

# a) Amortised cost (AC)

Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest income / profit / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 170

# b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for debt based financial assets in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of debt based financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is transferred from surplus / deficit to unappropriated profit.

---

## Chunk 171

# Equity instruments

Equity instruments are instruments that meet the definition of equity from the issuer's perspective; that is, instruments that do not contain a contractual obligation to pay and that evidence a residual share in the issuer's net assets. The Bank measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, except where the Bank's management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Bank's policy is to designate equity investments as FVOCI when those investments are held for purposes other than for trading. When this election is used, fair value gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to the profit and loss account, including on disposal. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return on such investments, continue to be recognised in the profit and loss account as income when the Bank's right to receive payments is established.

IFRS 9 has removed the requirement for impairment assessments on equity investments. However, under BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024, dated July 29, 2024, Banks may continue to measure unquoted equity securities at the lower of cost or break-up value until December 31, 2024. Starting January 1, 2025, Banks will be required to measure unquoted equity securities at fair value, as mandated by the IFRS 9 application guidelines. For unquoted securities where the break-up value is lower than the cost, the difference has been classified as a loss and charged to the profit and loss account. Gains and losses on equity instruments at FVTPL are included in the ‘Gain on sales of securities’ line in the profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 172

# b) Debt based financial assets

Debt based financial assets are measured at FVOCI only if these meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as FVTPL:

- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest / profit on the principal amount outstanding.

Debt based financial assets if these are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

---

## Chunk 173

# c) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost will be directly recorded in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. Interest / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

---

## Chunk 174

# 3.2.6 Derecognition

# Financial assets

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

---

## Chunk 175

# Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 176

# 3.3 Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with all advances and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Bank recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money; and
- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject customer. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer / facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 60 days past due. When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Bank applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

---

## Chunk 177

# Based on the above process, the Bank groups its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3, as described below:

# Stage 1:

When financial instruments are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

---

## Chunk 178

# Stage 2:

When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

# Stage 3:

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises the LTECLs for these instruments. The Bank uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP.

---

## Chunk 179

# Undrawn financing commitments

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected cash flows if the financings is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. For revolving facilities that include both a financings and an undrawn commitment, ECLs are calculated on un-drawn portion of the facility and presented within other liabilities.

---

## Chunk 180

# Guarantee and letters of credit contracts

The Bank estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven and internally developed credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit contracts respectively. The calculation is made using a probability weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within other liabilities.

# The calculation of ECLs

The Bank calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash flows, discounted at an approximation to the EIR.

---

## Chunk 181

# The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:

# PD

The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the last 7 years. PDs for Non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.

---

## Chunk 182

# EAD

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest / profit from missed payments. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has a legal right to call it earlier. The Bank's product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail facilities, in which the Bank has the right to cancel and / or reduce the facilities with one day notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Bank does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the Bank expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the Bank future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

---

## Chunk 183

# LGD

The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD.

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective interest rate (at reporting date), the Bank uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date).

Effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The Bank considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics:

- History of legal certainty and enforceability
- History of enforceability and recovery

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three scenarios (a base case, a best case, a worst case). Each of these is associated with different PDs.

The Bank's management has only considered cash, liquid securities, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals, while calculating EADs.

The credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

As per BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level for corporate / commercial / SME loan portfolios and at segment / product basis for retail portfolio.

# Forward looking information

In its ECL models, the Bank relies on range of the following forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

- GDP Growth
- Consumer Price Index
- Unemployment rate

---

## Chunk 184

# Definition of default

The concept of "impairment or "default" is critical to the implementation of IFRS 9 as it drives determination of risk parameters, i.e. PD, LGD and EAD.

This implies that if one facility of a counterparty becomes 90+ DPD in repaying its contractual dues or as defined in PRs; all other facilities would deem to be classified as stage 3.

# Write-offs

The Bank's accounting policy under IFRS 9 remains the same as it was under SBP regulations / exiting reporting framework.

---

## Chunk 185

# 3.4 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held-for-sale

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held-for-sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of derecognition.

Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the statement of financial position. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the statement of financial position.

## Chunk 186

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The basis for accounting estimates adopted in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements is the same as that applied in the preparation of the unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for IFRS 9 as mentioned above.

# 5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

## Chunk 205

# 10.5.3 General provision includes provision amounting to Rs.154 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 270 million) pertaining to overseas advances to meet the requirements of regulatory authorities of the respective countries in which the Bank operates where IFRS 9 has not been implemented.

# 10.5.4 The SBP has allowed specific relaxation to the Bank for non-classification of overdue loans of certain Public Sector Entities (PSEs) which are guaranteed by Government of Pakistan as non-performing loans up till December 31, 2024. No provision is required against these loans; however, mark-up is being suspended as required by the Prudential Regulations. Further SBP has allowed specific relaxation on the requirement for ECL against overdue foreign currency loans of certain Public Sector Entities, either up till December 31, 2024 or permanently.

# 10.5.5 These represent non-performing advances for agriculture finance which have been classified as loss and fully provided for more than 3 years. These non-performing advances have been charged off by extinguishing them against the provision held in accordance with Prudential Regulations for Agriculture Financing issued by the SBP. This charge off does not, in any way, prejudice the Bank's right of recovery from these customers.

# 36. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted instruments classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

---

## Chunk 236

# 36.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1:  Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2:  Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3:  Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# Financial Instruments Analysis

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

Pool Management

NBP-AIBG has managed following pools for profit and loss distribution.

1. a) General depositor pool

The General pool consists of all other remunerative deposits. NBP Aitemaad (the Mudarib) accept deposits on the basis of Mudaraba from depositors (Rabbulmaal). The net return on the pool is arrived at after deduction of direct costs from the gross return earned on the pool. The entire net return after paying equity share to Mudarib is considered as distributable profit of the pool.
2. b) Special depositor pools (Total 161 during the period and 64 as at September 30, 2024)

Special pool(s) are created where the customers desire to invest in high yield assets. These pool(s) rates are higher than the general pool depending on the assets. In case of loss in special pool, the loss will be borne by the special pool members. The net return on the pool is arrived at after deduction of direct costs from the gross return earned on the pool. From the net return, and after allocation of share of profit to commingled equity, profit is paid to the Mudarib in the ratio of the Mudarib’s equity in the pool to the total pool. The balance represents the distributable profit.
3. c) Equity pool

Equity pools include AIBG's fund and current account deposits. The equity pool may have constructive liquidation every month and risk associated with assets of pool includes operational, market, equity, return and Shariah.

# Key features and risk & reward characteristics

Deposits are accepted from customers on the basis of Qard (current accounts) and Mudarabah (Saving and term deposits). No profit or loss is passed on to current account depositors.

For deposits accepted on Mudarabah basis from depositors (Rab ul Maal) the Bank acts as Manager (Mudarib) and invests the funds in the Shariah Compliant modes of financings. Rab ul Maal share is distributed among depositors according to weightages declared for a month before start of the period.

In case of loss in a pool during the profit calculation period, the loss is distributed among the depositors (remunerative) according to their ratio of investment.

For all pools, the Mudarib’s share is deducted from the distributable profit to calculate the profit to be allocated to depositors. The allocation of the profit to various deposit categories is determined by the amount invested in that category relative to the total pool, as well as by the weightage assigned to the various deposit categories.

The assets, liabilities, equities, income and expenses are segregated for each of the pool. No pool investment is intermingled with each other. The risk associated with each pool is thus equally distributed among the pools.
