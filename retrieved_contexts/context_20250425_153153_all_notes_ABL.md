# 4.17 Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognized to the extent that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. These are recognised as follows:

- a) Advances and investments: Mark-up, return on regular loans and advances and investments is recognized on a time proportion basis. Where debt securities are purchased at premium or discount, the same is amortized through the Profit and Loss Account using the effective interest rate method. Interest or mark-up recoverable on classified loans, advances and investments is recognized on receipt basis. Interest, return or mark-up on classified, rescheduled or restructured loans and advances and investments is recognized as permitted by the regulations of the State Bank of Pakistan. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive the dividend is established. Gain and losses on sale of debt investments and equity investments classified as Fair Value Through Profit and Loss are recognized in the Profit and Loss Account. Gain and losses on sale of equity investments classified as Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income are reclassified from Equity to Unappropriated Profit.
- b) Lease financing: Financing method is used in accounting for income from lease financing. Under this method, the unearned lease income (excess of the sum of total lease rentals and estimated residual value over the cost of leased assets) is deferred and taken to income over the term of the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding net investment in lease. Unrealised income on classified leases is recognized on receipt basis. Gains or losses on termination of lease contracts and other lease income are recognized when realized.
- c) Islamic financing and related assets: Profit on Business Musharakah financing is booked on accrual basis and is adjusted upon declaration of profit by Musharakah partners. Ijarah and Diminishing Musharakah income is recognised on an accrual basis as and when the rental becomes due. Murabaha, Musawamah and Salam income is recognised on deferred income basis. Profit on Istisna financing is recognized on an accrual basis commencing from time of sale of goods till the realization of sale proceeds by the Bank.
- d) Fees, brokerage and commission: Fee, Commission and Brokerage income is recognized on an accrual basis except where, in the opinion of management, it would not be prudent to do so.
