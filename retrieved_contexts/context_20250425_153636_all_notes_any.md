# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UN-AUDITED)

# FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024

# 3.1 Changes in accounting policies and transition disclosures

# 3.1.1 Impact of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Bank has opted for modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening retained earnings and other reserves at the beginning of the current year without restating the comparative figures. For notes disclosures, the consequential amendments to IFRS 7 disclosures as a result of adoption of IFRS 9 have also only been applied to the current period. The comparative period notes disclosures repeat those disclosures made in the prior year. The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in the accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 also significantly amends other standards dealing with financial instruments such as IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.
