# 4.21.2 Lease financing

Income from lease financing is accounted for using the financing method. Under this method, the unearned lease income (defined as the sum of total lease rentals and estimated residual value less the cost of the leased assets) is deferred and taken to income over the term of the lease so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding net investment in the lease. Gains or losses on termination of lease contracts are recognised through the profit and loss account when these are realised. Unrealised lease income and other fees on classified leases are recognised on a receipt basis.

# 4.21.3 Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive the dividend is established.

# 4.21.4 Fee, brokerage and commission income

The Bank earns fee and commission income from a diverse range of financial services it provides to its customers. Fee and commission income is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Bank expects to be entitled in exchange for providing the services.

The Bank recognises fees earned on transaction-based arrangements at a point in time when the Bank has provided the service to the customer. Where the contract requires services to be provided over time, income is recognised on a systematic basis over the life of the related services. Unearned fee and commission are included under Other Liabilities.

# 4.22 Foreign currencies

# 4.22.1 Functional and presentation currency

Items included in these unconsolidated financial statements are measured at Pakistan Rupees which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Bank operates.
