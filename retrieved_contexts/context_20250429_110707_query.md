# Profitability

# Net Spread

The return on financings, investments and placements increased by 14% to Rs 494 billion in 2024 from Rs 432 billion in the previous year. This growth, driven by an increase in the average earning assets base, was partially offset by a decline in the underlying benchmark rate which averaged 19.6% in 2024 compared to 20.7% in 2023. Despite significant growth in profit earned, the Bank’s focus on growing its low-cost deposits portfolio resulted in the return on deposits and borrowings being maintained largely at last year’s levels (Rs 207 billion in 2024 as compared to Rs 205 billion in 2023).

# Profit And Loss Account

The Bank reported a Profit after Tax of Rs 101.5 billion, reflecting a 20% increase from Rs 84.5 billion in the prior year.

The basic Earnings Per Share rose by 20%, reaching Rs 56.62 per share, compared to Rs 47.18 per share in 2023.

The Bank’s net spread grew by 27%, primarily driven by strong balance sheet growth. This was further bolstered by a notable increase in average current and savings account balances, contributing to a healthy net spread. Fee, commission, and other income rose by 20% year-on-year, with a significant uptick in fee income from debit cards. As a result, the Bank’s non-funded income saw a remarkable growth of 31%, reaching Rs 29 billion, up from Rs 22 billion in 2023.

Operating and other expenses increased to Rs 84.6 billion, up from Rs 71.8 billion, primarily due to higher costs associated with the opening of 47 new branches and investments in IT infrastructure. Despite this, the Bank remained focused on cost optimization through operational efficiencies and process streamlining, leading to an improvement in its income efficiency ratio, which decreased to 27% from 29% in the previous year. The total tax charge for the year rose to Rs 120.6 billion, compared to Rs 84.9 billion, driven by higher profitability.

# Profit and Loss Account

The Bank has achieved exceptional growth in Profit after Tax, increasing nearly seven-fold from Rs 15.2 billion in 2019 to Rs 101.5 billion in 2024. This growth aligns with the expansion of the Bank's asset base, a significant rise in current and savings accounts, and the increase in the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) policy rate. As a result, the Bank’s net spread surged to Rs 287 billion, up from Rs 47 billion in 2019. The Bank also saw impressive growth in fee, commission, foreign exchange, and other income, rising from Rs 9.4 billion in 2019 to Rs 23.4 billion in 2024. This increase in fee income is primarily driven by the Bank's rapidly growing trade business, which exceeded Rs 2.7 trillion.

# Outlook

Meezan is steadfast in its commitment to bolstering the economic growth and stability of the nation through the enhancement of the Islamic Banking Industry. We are aligned with the Government’s strategic pivot towards Islamic Finance, following the directive of the Honourable Federal Shariat Court (FSC) to fully transition the economy to a Shariah-Compliant financial system. Our strategy emphasizes balanced growth, diversification across sectors and surpassing regulatory stability benchmarks. We are expanding our footprint through both physical and digital channels, with a strong emphasis on delivering premier digital services to sustain our leadership in the industry.

We extend our heartfelt appreciation to the State Bank of Pakistan, the Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan for their unwavering commitment to establishing a sustainable Islamic financial system in the country. Our significant accomplishments would not have been possible without the proactive support of our diverse customer base, to whom we are deeply indebted. We also express our gratitude to the Board of Directors, members of the Shariah Board, our shareholders, holders of Additional Tier I Sukuk and Subordinated Sukuk (Tier II) for their continuous patronage for establishing Meezan Bank as the leading Islamic Bank in the country.

We convey our appreciation to every member of our devoted team for their diligent efforts and steadfast dedication to furthering the mission of Islamic Banking. Above all, we humbly acknowledge and offer gratitude to Allah Almighty for His continuous blessings upon our Bank and each one of us, which have enabled our notable achievements within a relatively brief timeframe. We beseech Him for His continued support, granting us the fortitude and insight to continue advancing our vision of “establishing Islamic banking as the banking of first choice”.

# Financial Performance and Challenges

Alhamdulillah, Meezan Bank achieved record financial performance this year. Profit after tax reached Rs 101.5 billion, making Meezan the first bank in the country’s history to surpass Rs 100 billion in profitability. This growth was driven by a strong increase in deposits, which grew to Rs 2.58 trillion. The Bank’s focus on expanding its financing portfolio across diverse customer segments led to a 57% increase in its financing portfolio, taking it to Rs 1.5 trillion.

Looking ahead, the Bank now faces a new set of challenges, including a declining policy rate, imposition of higher income tax and the imposition of Minimum Deposit Rate (MDR) on Islamic banks. Meezan is gearing up to navigate these new set of challenges by further strengthening its core business as well as exploring additional revenue streams to mitigate the impact of these factors.

Although the declining policy rate may present short-term challenges for the banking sector, it is ultimately beneficial for the economy, as lower cost of financing will support business growth, and in turn, boost credit demand, thereby contributing to Bank‘s long-term profitability.

Annual Report 2024 73

PRESIDENT’S
REVIEW

The year 2024 will be remembered as a period of transition and cautious optimism for the global economy. While geopolitical tensions and the lingering effects of past disruptions continued to pose challenges, the gradual shift towards monetary easing by major economies is providing much-needed relief to consumers and businesses. Lower borrowing costs helped ease financial pressures, creating a more favorable environment for growth and innovation. Against this backdrop, MCB Bank delivered another year of strong financial performance, reaffirming its position as one of Pakistan’s leading financial institutions.

Our international operations continued to grow, with MCB UAE expanding its footprint by opening a second branch in Sharjah, while MCB Bahrain delivered its highest-ever profit, reflecting our strategic focus on international market expansion and operational excellence. The Bank remained a key player in home remittances, recording USD 4.6 billion in inflows, recording a 41% increase and raising its market share to 13.2%. The State Bank of Pakistan ranked MCB as the 3rd largest bank in the home remittance market at the PRI Awards 2024, underscoring our efforts in strengthening formal remittance channels and supporting economic stability.

Throughout 2024, we remained steadfast in executing our strategic priorities—expanding our deposit base, strengthening core earnings, and enhancing our market presence. The Bank’s deposits grew by Rs. 117 billion, driven by a strategic focus on mobilizing low-cost and no-cost deposits. This growth was underpinned by well-defined key performance indicators (KPIs) and improved service quality. Additionally, our dedicated efforts in onboarding new-to-bank (NTB) customers, deepening existing relationships, and reactivating dormant accounts played a pivotal role in strengthening our deposit momentum.

MCB Bank’s financial strength, governance, and performance continued to be recognized across various platforms. PACRA reaffirmed our AAA (Triple A) long-term and A1+ (A One Plus) short-term credit ratings, showcasing our strong financial standing. Our Annual Report 2023 was ranked first in the banking sector and declared the overall winner by the Joint Evaluation Committee of ICAP and ICMA. At the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) 10th Annual Trade and Supply Chain Finance Program (TSCFP) Awards in Singapore, MCB Bank was honored with the accolades of ‘Leading Partner Bank in Pakistan’ and ‘Momentum Award – Issuing Bank’, recognizing our role in facilitating trade growth.

Our financial strength allowed us to deliver exceptional value to shareholders. The Bank declared 360% cash dividends reflecting our commitment to shareholder returns while maintaining a robust balance sheet. Profit Before Tax stood at Rs. 118.4 billion, while total assets increased by 11%, reaching Rs. 2.7 trillion. Average current deposits grew by Rs. 82 billion (+10%), fueled by a strategically focused deposit mobilization campaign. Despite aggressive monetary easing and a downward yield curve shift, net interest income grew by 1% to Rs. 149 billion.

Our fee & commission income recorded a 5% increase, while dividend income grew by 15% compared to the previous year. Maintaining cost discipline, the Bank’s cost-to-income ratio remained efficient at 32.68%, reflecting a disciplined expense management approach. The Return on Assets (ROA) of 2.25% and Return on Equity (ROE) of 26.56% further underscore our financial resilience and operational efficiency.

Our capital position remains strong and significantly above regulatory requirements, with a Capital Adequacy Ratio among the highest in the industry. The Bank’s risk management framework continues to evolve, ensuring improved asset quality and reduced delinquency across our loan book. MCB remains committed to nurturing a high-performing workforce by investing in employee development, fostering an inclusive culture, and enhancing workplace well-being. Our strategic talent initiatives ensure a skilled and engaged team, driving innovation and excellence across the organization.

As a responsible corporate citizen, MCB continues to create positive social impact through sustainable initiatives focused on financial inclusion, education, healthcare, and environmental conservation. Our commitment to ESG principles strengthens our role in building a more resilient and sustainable future.

MCB Bank is strategically positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities in an evolving economic landscape. As interest rates decline, competitive pressures rise and technology-driven banking accelerates, we remain fully committed to expand trade finance business, strengthening digital banking & payment solutions, enhancing customer-centric products & deposit growth and fostering an agile, risk-aware, and innovation-driven banking culture.

Our customer base expanded to more than 9.0 million accounts, supported by an extensive network of 1,403 branches and 1,477 ATMs across Pakistan, UAE, and Sri Lanka. Together with our wholly-owned Islamic banking subsidiary, we operate Pakistan’s second-largest branch network.

I extend my sincere gratitude to our Chairman and Board of Directors for their strategic leadership, the State Bank of Pakistan and other regulators for their guidance, our shareholders for their unwavering trust, our customers for their continued support, loyalty & business, and, most importantly, our employees, whose dedication and resilience continue to drive our success.

Together, we will continue to build a stronger, more innovative, and customer-focused MCB Bank.

# Outlook

Meezan Bank remains committed to supporting the economic growth and stability of our nation through the development of the Islamic Banking Industry. Our strategy prioritizes balanced growth, sector diversification and exceeding regulatory stability benchmarks. We are expanding our presence through both physical and digital channels, with a strong focus on delivering exceptional digital services to maintain our industry leadership. In view of the recent reduction in policy rate by Monetary Policy Committee of the SBP, there will be a pressure on the margins of the banking industry going forward. The Bank will endeavour to mitigate this impact through growth in core CASA deposits and improving its non-fund based revenue.

We extend our heartfelt appreciation to the State Bank of Pakistan, the Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan for their unwavering commitment to establishing a sustainable Islamic financial system in the country. Our significant accomplishments would not have been possible without the proactive support of our diverse customer base, to whom we are deeply indebted. We also express our gratitude to the Board of Directors, members of the Shariah Board, our shareholders and holders of Additional Tier I and Subordinated Tier II Sukuks for their continuous patronage for establishing Meezan Bank as the leading Islamic Bank in the country.

We would like to convey our appreciation to every member of our devoted team for their diligent efforts and steadfast dedication to furthering the mission of Islamic Banking. Above all, we humbly acknowledge and offer gratitude to Allah Almighty for His continuous blessings upon our Bank and each one of us, which have made possible our notable achievements within a relatively brief timeframe. We beseech Him for His continued support, granting us the fortitude and insight to continue advancing our Vision of “establishing Islamic banking as banking of first choice”.
