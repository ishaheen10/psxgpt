# DUPONT ANALYSIS

|Description|2024|2023|2022|2021|2020|2019|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Profit Margin - %|19.4%|18.6%|17.9%|22.7%|19%|14.7%|
|Asset Turnover|0.15|0.16|0.11|0.07|0.09|0.10|
|Equity Multiplier - Times|16.0|18.6|22.2|22|20.6|20.7|
|ROE|47.0%|56.3%|44.6%|36.4%|34.6%|30.7%|

Following are the main Dupont analysis highlights:

- The Bank’s profit margin depicts an increase in 2024 due to a significant dip in cost of funds, as well as a substantial increase in non-funded income in the year.
- The asset turnover has decreased during the current year due to a higher than proportionate increase in total assets as compared to increase in profit after tax during the year.
- The equity multiplier is directly dependent on the Bank’s equity in relation to total assets and has decreased due to strong growth in equity as a result of higher profitability.
