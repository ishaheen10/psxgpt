# DuPont Analysis

DuPont analysis consists of extended examination of Return on Equity (ROE) of a company which analyses Net Profit Margin, Asset Turnover and Financial Leverage. It gives a broader view of the Return the company is earnings on its Equity. This analysis, in turn, helps management to take various strategic and operational decisions. It concludes that a company can earn higher return on equity if it:

- Earns a high net profit margin
- Uses its Assets effectively to generate more revenue
- Has a high financial leverage

| | |2024|2023|2022|2021|2020|2019|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Net Operating Margin<br />PAT / Total Income|A|30.89%|33.02%|29.29%|36.65%|32.45%|31.43%|
|Asset Utilization<br />Total Income / Average Assets|B|7.27%|8.01%|5.51%|4.51%|5.47%|5.06%|
|Return on Assets|C = A x B|2.25%|2.64%|1.61%|1.65%|1.77%|1.59%|
|Leverage Ratio / Equity Multiplier<br />Average Assets / Average Equity|D|11.83|11.95|12.25|11.56|10.64|10.58|
|Return on Equity|C X D|26.56%|31.60%|19.78%|19.11%|18.88%|16.84%|

Following are the main DuPont analysis highlights:

1. Over the course of the review period, the highest net operating margin was recorded in 2021, while 2022 had recorded the lowest measure. During 2024, net operating margin was reported at 30.89%, slightly below the preceding 5 years (2019 - 2023) average of 32.57%.
2. The Bank has been prudently and proactively managing its assets, amidst evolving yield curve movements, to ensure sustainable returns to the stakeholders. Asset utilization in 2024 was recorded at a robust level of 7.27%, despite a decline of 900bps in policy rate announced during the year.
3. During 2024, Equity Multiplier was reported slightly below the previous years measure, while still higher than the preceding 5 years (2019 - 2023) average measure of 11.4.

A repurchase agreement, or repo, is a short term funding agreements which allow a borrower to sell a financial asset, such as ABS or government bonds as collateral for cash. As part of the agreement the borrower agrees to repurchase the security at some later date, usually less than 30 days, repaying the proceeds of the loan. For the party on the other end of the transaction (buying the security and agreeing to sell in the future) it is a reverse repurchase agreement or reverse repo.

# Return on Equity (ROE)
