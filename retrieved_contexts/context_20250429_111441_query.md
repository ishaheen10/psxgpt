# Strategies in Place

From customer service standpoint, special focus remains on improving our service quality and service standards levels. The Bank will integrate service standards across all the channels and outlets in the network to provide a uniform customer experience.

MCB endeavors to meet expectations of its valued customer base. Another important aspect remains credit quality and Bank’s refined risk appetite. We will thereby give value to our customers across the entire spectrum of retail, corporate and SME segments while improving Bank’s asset quality.

Under the ‘Strategic Plan’, we also intend to expand our geographical boundaries by being open to potential new business models, innovative processes and delivery channels, enabling provision of 24x7 customer services.

Today, technology is a major component of the competitive edge of any bank. With millennials being an increasing percentage of our customer base, we have to cater to their expectations and it requires leveraging cutting edge technology. The other side of the coin however, is that technology brings risks with it. We will go the extra mile, to ensure our assets and those of our customers are secure and sensitive information is protected.

To ensure efficient and effective operations of the Bank, we need systems and processes that operate seamlessly. This is another focus area where we will concentrate on identifying pain points and gaps, and make the necessary modifications.

To safeguard the financial stability and reputation of the Bank, good governance and ethical conduct are imperative. While we already have high standards in these areas, we have set our benchmarks as the best in class practices in the country. We will renew and re-energize our focus on sustainability by ensuring that we continue to maintain a judicious balance between economic, social and environmental objectives.

The end result of all the above will be the enhancement of our ‘Brand’. The brand is a mirror of our image in the eyes of our customers, both legacy and millennials, and the general public. Through the strategies spelt out in our ‘Strategic Plan’ we will continue to forge ahead, building our Brand, increasing our assets and profitability, while delivering increasing value to all our stakeholders.
