# Conclusion

As per the Charter of the Bank, it is mandatory for the management and employees to ensure the application of Shariah principles and guidelines issued by the Shariah Board and Resident Shariah Board Member, and to ensure Shariah compliance in all activities of the Bank. The primary responsibility for ensuring Shariah compliance of the Bank’s operations thus lies with the Board of Directors and Executive Management.

Based on extensive reviews of sample cases for each class of transaction, related documentations, processes, profit distribution mechanism for the depositors by the SCD, as well as the review of Internal Shariah Audit and External Shariah Audit reports and Management’s representation in this regard, the Bank, in our opinion, has complied with the rules & principles of Islamic Shariah in light of the guidelines and directives given by the Shariah Board, Resident Shariah Board Member of Meezan Bank, and the guidelines issued by the Shariah Advisory Committee of the SBP related to Shariah compliance. The non-compliant income identified during the review is being transferred to the Charity Account through a well-defined system and is being utilized properly in accordance with the instructions of the SB.

Based on the strength and capacity of the full-fledged SCD and the policies and guidelines for Shariah compliance issued at the Bank, we are of the opinion that an effective mechanism is in place to ensure Shariah compliance in overall operations of the Bank.
