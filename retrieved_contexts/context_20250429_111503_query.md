# Technological Innovation & Digitization

The ongoing global technology revolution and widespread adoption of digital technologies have transformed the way people interact with financial services, including how they access banking services, make payments, invest, and manage their money. In many ways it has accelerated the adoption of digital products, services and channels; leading to new revenue channels, increased productivity, and cost savings. At the same time, technology continues to impact organizational structures and business models, skill requirements, internal processes and capabilities, as well as remote work practices.

Over the past few years financial services companies have increasingly started to embrace and leverage mobile technology, fintech partnerships, cloud computing, big data, advanced analytics, machine learning, blockchain technology, AI, robotics and biometrics in the optimization of legacy IT infrastructure for pursuing new revenue channels and opportunities.

With a growing youth population and a tech-savvy workforce, Pakistan is at a critical juncture to harness the power of digital transformation to shape its future. The rise of mobile banking and digital payment solutions revolutionized the financial landscape, making transactions more efficient and accessible. As Pakistan navigates the complexities of the digital age, it must not only seize the opportunities but also proactively address the challenges to ensure an inclusive, sustainable, and digitally empowered future. Achieving this shall require undertaking a holistic approach that encompasses investment in education, cyber-security measures, and the development of a robust digital infrastructure.

However, along with the benefits, the adoption of digital solutions has also introduced new risks, especially in terms of cyber risks. The rise of cyberattacks, aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money, or disrupting normal business processes, has underscored the need for financial institutions to enhance their cybersecurity measures. Banks have become attractive targets for cyberattacks because of their key role in payment and settlement systems, the volume of sensitive client information they hold and the potentially adverse impact of interfering with the smooth functioning of banking services. Remaining cognizant, MCB continues to invest in cutting-edge technologies and capabilities that prioritize the security of its clients’ data and systems without adding needless friction to the client experience.

# Key Watch Out’s

|Security and legacy systems|Term|Material Risks Mapping|
|---|---|---|
|Hyper personalization|Short Term|Operational Risk - Medium|
|Ecosystem partnerships|Medium Term|Technological / Information Security Risk - High|
| |Long Term| |
