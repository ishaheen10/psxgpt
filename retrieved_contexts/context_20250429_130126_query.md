# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# 38.1.9.13

The significant risks associated with the defined benefit schemes are as follows:

- Mortality risks

The risk that the actual mortality experience is different. The impact depends on the beneficiaries’ service / age distribution and the benefit.
- Investment risks

The risk that the investments of the Funds will underperform and not be sufficient to meet the liabilities.
- Final salary risks

The risk that the final salary at the time of cessation of service is higher than what was assumed. Since the benefit is calculated based on the final salary, the benefit amount increases similarly.
- Withdrawal risks

The risk that withdrawals from the plan will be higher or lower than assumed. The impact depends on the beneficiaries’ service / age distribution and the benefit.

# Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk arises due to changes in interest rates, including changes in the shape of the yield curve. The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk in both the Trading and Banking Books. Interest rate sensitivity analysis is conducted at both Banking Book and Trading Book levels, at least on a monthly basis or more frequently, if required. The analysis helps in estimating and managing the impact of interest rate volatility on the Bank’s earnings and on the Economic Value of Equity (EVE) within defined tolerance limits. Limits are also in place for fixed income investments of the treasury portfolio at dealer, transaction, portfolio and Trading / Banking Book levels. Regulatory stress testing is conducted on a quarterly basis. Metrics to assess Interest Rate Risk include Interest Rate Gap Reports, Earnings at Risk (EAR) and EVE, which are assessed based on different stress scenarios.

# Impact of Interest Rates

|Impact of 1% increase in interest rates on|Banking book|Trading book|
|---|---|---|
|Profit and loss account|(600,594)|(1,763,209)|
|Other comprehensive income|211,521|-|

# Risk Management Framework

HBL manages the identification, assessment and mitigation of top and emerging risks through a robust internal governance process and the use of risk management tools and processes. The Board of Directors exercises strong oversight and the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) monitors and assesses the risk profile of the Bank on an ongoing basis. At senior management level, various risk committees are responsible for oversight and execution, with day-to-day risk management activities delegated to different levels.

The Bank’s aim is to reinforce resilience by adopting a holistic approach to risk management, while mitigating its impact on HBL’s financial results, long-term strategic goals and reputational profile. Key risks as reflected in HBL’s risk taxonomy include credit risk, market & liquidity risk, reputational risk, environmental and social risk, and operational risk.

As economic conditions remained challenging, stress testing and frequent portfolio reviews to identify vulnerable segments helped to ensure the strength and resilience of the Bank’s credit portfolio. The global economic and political environment was closely monitored in order to proactively manage country risk exposures. There was a continued focus on enhancing portfolio monitoring and implementing tools for the early identification of risks. The Bank updated its expert judgment models through statistical techniques in the Corporate and Commercial segment whilst consumer scorecard models were redeveloped and recalibrated to enhance their predictive power. In agriculture banking, a revamped process of customer onboarding and centralized underwriting under the ambit of the Credit Initiation Unit has been implemented which will further improve the credit decisioning quality.

HBL continues to invest in its people by providing them the tools and skills in a constantly changing external environment. HBL Credit School, a comprehensive modular training programme plays a major role in fostering a consistent credit risk assessment mindset that is focused on forward-looking risk drivers, and hence helps to adopt a proactive, rather than a reactive approach based merely on historical data. The programme has been fully developed in-house and is delivered by the Bank’s senior resources. HBL also provided in-house IFRS 9 training to both business and risk personnel. In addition, the Bank conducted a session for market participants to enhance their understanding and development of IFRS 9 models whilst providing a platform for related modelling issues.

Market and liquidity risk indicators are reviewed on a monthly basis by the Market & Liquidity Risk Committee and by ALCO. A comprehensive structure is in place to ensure that the Bank remains within its tolerance for market risk.

HBL’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework outlines the risk management principles and sets out the governance structure, standards, objectives and key responsibilities of different functions. A bank-wide Integrated Risk and Control Repository (IRCR) has been created and will help to identify, assess risks and issues in a holistic manner, thereby ensuring that these are adequately monitored and mitigated.

Policies and procedures have been established to govern operational risk management in a systematic and consistent manner. IRCR, along with other tools like Key Risk Indicators and Operational Loss Data Management are used to gauge the likelihood and severity of operational risk incidents. The Bank’s operational risk profile and fraud risk assessment are regularly discussed at senior management level.

# Equity Position Risk

Equity position risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in the prices of individual stocks or the levels of equity indices. The Bank has exposure to a range of equity instruments, and is thus exposed to losses arising from movements in equity prices. The Bank holds equity investments in both the FVOCI and FVTPL portfolios. The realization of short-term capital gains is the principal objective of the FVTPL portfolio while the FVOCI portfolio is held primarily to earn dividend income. The portfolios are managed by the Bank within the structure encapsulated in the Equity Investment Policy approved by the Board, which defines position limits, portfolio limits and loss triggers for the equity desk. The Bank also applies stress tests on the equity portfolio to ensure that the exposure remains within the market risk appetite of the Bank.

# Impact of Equity Prices

|Profit and loss account|436,967|-|

# Business Model Assessment

# 45.2.4 Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk arises due to changes in interest rates, including changes in the shape of the yield curve. The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk in both the Trading and Banking Books. Interest rate sensitivity analysis is conducted at both Banking Book and Trading Book levels, at least on a monthly basis or more frequently, if required. The analysis helps in estimating and managing the impact of interest rate volatility on the Bank’s earnings and on the Economic Value of Equity (EVE) within defined tolerance limits. Limits are also in place for fixed income investments of the treasury portfolio at dealer, transaction, portfolio and Trading / Banking Book levels. Regulatory stress testing is conducted on a quarterly basis. Metrics to assess Interest Rate Risk include Interest Rate Gap Reports, Earnings at Risk (EAR) and EVE, which are assessed based on different stress scenarios. To further strengthen interest rate risk management, the Bank has developed a standardized framework for computing the Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) under the updated guidelines issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Standards.
