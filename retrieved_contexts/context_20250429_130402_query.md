# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

# 45.1 Credit risk management

Credit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss stemming from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or otherwise meet a contractual obligation. While loans are the largest and most obvious source, credit risk also stems from both on and off-balance sheet activities. The Bank's credit risk appetite is defined through a Global Risk Appetite Statement that is approved by the Board. It also covers the concentration risks the Bank is willing to take with reference to risk ratings, sectors and large exposures. The credit process at the Bank is governed by well-defined and documented credit policies and procedures including specific, separate policies for consumer lending, agriculture banking and SME financing. Certain types of exposures/facilities are managed under product programs that contain their own detailed credit criteria, and compliance and documentation requirements.

The core pillars of credit risk management at the Bank are:

- Approval rules based on a three-initial system and joint Business / Risk sign-offs.
- An independent Internal Audit function which includes a Business Risk Review (BRR) unit.

Credit approval authorities are delegated to individuals based on their qualifications and experience. Disbursement authorization, collateral and security management, documentation and monitoring are managed by the Credit Administration Department. Proactive monitoring is ensured for assets under stress, enabling the Bank to implement viable solutions to prevent further deterioration in credit quality. An independent Structured Credits and Remedial Assets function handles stressed assets and ensures a focused remedial strategy.

A loan origination system has now been firmly embedded in most of the domestic businesses and in some international locations, allowing system-based loan origination, approvals and archiving of approver comments.

Stress testing of the credit portfolio is performed in line with SBP guidelines. In addition to the mandatory stress tests defined by the regulator, the Bank has also developed advanced stress tests for credit risk including macroeconomic stress tests and reverse stress tests to test the adequacy of the Bank's capital under various stress conditions. The Bank also regularly conducts rapid portfolio reviews in line with emerging risks.

BRR performs an independent review of the credit portfolio. It provides an assessment of portfolio quality by reviewing the efficacy of the relevant processes, ensuring regulatory / policy compliance, and assessing the appropriateness of risk ratings, classification and provisioning.

The Bank has undertaken several initiatives to strengthen its credit risk management framework including the establishment of a Financial Risk Modelling & Stress Testing unit responsible for the development of credit risk scorecards and internal risk rating (obligor risk rating and facility risk rating) models. This unit also develops all IFRS 9 related models, including Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD). The models are updated periodically and the results are used for ECL calculations.

For the rated portfolio, the PD is estimated using the theory of the Markov Chain process which uses information regarding transitions between internally developed Obligor Risk Ratings (ORRs) (from 1 to 12). For the unrated portfolio, Roll Rate Estimation is used to calculate PDs by DPD bucket for each segment.

The computation of ECL is sensitive to macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth rate, inflation, and interest rates. For the computation of forward-looking PDs, the Bank uses forecasted macroeconomic data from independent external sources. The Bank regularly reviews and updates PD models to reflect changes in economic conditions.

The Bank uses the Frye-Jacobs approach to convert through the cycle LGD to a forward-looking point in time LGD. The parameters used to estimate through the cycle LGD are based on the historical trend of the Bank’s recovery rates and the time periods over which these recoveries are realized. These parameters are then applied to current exposures, and the result discounted to determine the present value of potential recoveries and hence the estimated loss on defaulted accounts.

For estimation of EAD where committed amounts are not unconditionally cancellable, a CCF, derived from a study of historical patterns, is applied to the undrawn amounts. For portfolios where a CCF cannot be computed due to data limitations, the CCF defined under the Basel guidelines is applied.

These models are reviewed and validated independently by a Model Risk Management unit within the Enterprise Risk Management function. The performance of these models is monitored periodically through statistical tools and back testing.

# 45.1 Credit risk management

Credit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss stemming from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or otherwise meet a contractual obligation. While loans are the largest and most obvious source, credit risk also stems from both on and off-balance sheet activities. The Bank's credit risk appetite is defined through a Global Risk Appetite Statement that is approved by the Board. It also covers the concentration risks the Bank is willing to take with reference to risk ratings, sectors and large exposures. The credit process at the Bank is governed by well-defined and documented credit policies and procedures including specific, separate policies for consumer lending, agriculture banking and SME financing. Certain types of exposures/facilities are managed under product programs that contain their own detailed credit criteria, and compliance and documentation requirements.

The core pillars of credit risk management at the Bank are:

- Approval rules based on a three-initial system and joint Business / Risk sign-offs.
- An independent Internal Audit function which includes a Business Risk Review (BRR) unit.

Credit approval authorities are delegated to individuals based on their qualifications and experience. Disbursement authorization, collateral and security management, documentation and monitoring are managed by the Credit Administration Department. Proactive monitoring is ensured for assets under stress, enabling the Bank to implement viable solutions to prevent further deterioration in credit quality. An independent Structured Credits and Remedial Assets function handles stressed assets and ensures a focused remedial strategy.

A loan origination system has now been firmly embedded in most of the domestic businesses and in some international locations, allowing system-based loan origination, approvals and archiving of approver comments.

Stress testing of the credit portfolio is performed in line with SBP guidelines. In addition to the mandatory stress tests defined by the regulator, the Bank has also developed advanced stress tests for credit risk including macroeconomic stress tests and reverse stress tests to test the adequacy of the Bank's capital under various stress conditions. The Bank also regularly conducts rapid portfolio reviews in line with emerging risks.

BRR performs an independent review of the credit portfolio. It provides an assessment of portfolio quality by reviewing the efficacy of the relevant processes, ensuring regulatory / policy compliance, and assessing the appropriateness of risk ratings, classification and provisioning.

The Bank has undertaken several initiatives to strengthen its credit risk management framework including the establishment of a Financial Risk Modelling & Stress Testing unit responsible for the development of credit risk scorecards and internal risk rating (obligor risk rating and facility risk rating) models. This unit also develops all IFRS 9 related models, including Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD). The models are updated periodically and the results are used for ECL calculations.

For the rated portfolio, the PD is estimated using the theory of the Markov Chain process which uses information regarding transitions between internally developed Obligor Risk Ratings (ORRs) (from 1 to 12). For the unrated portfolio, Roll Rate Estimation is used to calculate PDs by DPD bucket for each segment.

The computation of ECL is sensitive to macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth rate, inflation, and interest rates. For the computation of forward-looking PDs, the Bank uses forecasted macroeconomic data from independent external sources. The Bank regularly reviews and updates PD models to reflect changes in economic conditions.

The Bank uses the Frye-Jacobs approach to convert through the cycle LGD to a forward-looking point in time LGD. The parameters used to estimate through the cycle LGD are based on the historical trend of the Bank’s recovery rates and the time periods over which these recoveries are realized. These parameters are then applied to current exposures, and the result discounted to determine the present value of potential recoveries and hence the estimated loss on defaulted accounts.

For estimation of EAD where committed amounts are not unconditionally cancellable, a CCF, derived from a study of historical patterns, is applied to the undrawn amounts. For portfolios where a CCF cannot be computed due to data limitations, the CCF defined under the Basel guidelines is applied.

These models are reviewed and validated independently by a Model Risk Management unit within the Enterprise Risk Management function. The performance of these models is monitored periodically through statistical tools and back testing.
